"<DIV align=left style=font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1921, we were formed as a cooperative designed to meet the needs of dairy farmers located"
"in the Midwest. We have expanded our business through mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures to"
"diversify our product portfolio, to leverage our portfolio of brand names, to achieve economies of"
"scale and to extend our geographic coverage. We operate our business in five segments: Dairy Foods,"
"Feed, Seed, Agronomy and Layers. Dairy Foods develops, produces, markets and sells a variety of"
"premium butter, spreads, cheese and other related dairy products. Feed develops, produces, markets"
"and distributes animal feed to both the lifestyle and livestock animal markets. Seed develops,"
"markets, distributes and sells seed for a variety of crops, including alfalfa, corn, soybeans,"
"forages and turf grass. Agronomy primarily consists of the operations of Winfield Solutions, LLC"
"(&#147;Winfield&#148;), a wholly owned subsidiary established in September&nbsp;2007 upon the distribution of"
"certain wholesale crop protection product assets to the Company from Agriliance LLC. Winfield"
"operates primarily as a wholesale distributor of crop protection products. Agronomy also includes a"
"50% equity investment in Agriliance LLC, which only operates a retail agronomy distribution"
"business. Layers produces, distributes and markets shell egg products through MoArk, LLC"
"(&#147;MoArk&#148;). We have additional operations and interests in other joint ventures and investments"
"that are not consolidated in our five operating segments."

"retail customers are serviced through direct sales employees and independent national food brokers."
"Our retail sales force consists of approximately 60 employees who service our larger retail"

"<DIV align=left style=font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a central sales and marketing team that maintains relationships with our industrial"

"<DIV align=left style=font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Distribution. </I>We contract with third-party trucking companies to distribute our dairy"
"products throughout the United States in refrigerated trucks. In addition, we also lease railroad"
"cars. Our dairy products are shipped to our customers either directly from the manufacturing"
"facilities or from one of our five regional distribution centers located in New Jersey, Tennessee,"
"Illinois, California and Ohio. As most of our dairy products are perishable, our distribution"
"facilities are designed to provide necessary temperature controls in order to ensure the quality"
"and freshness of our products. The combination of our strategically located manufacturing and"
"distribution facilities and our logistics capabilities enables us to provide our customers with a"
"highly efficient delivery system."
"</DIV>"
"<DIV align=left style=font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Production. </I>We produce our dairy products at 10 manufacturing facilities located throughout"
"the United States. We also have contractual arrangements whereby we engage other dairy processors"
"to produce some of our products. We believe the geographic distribution of our plants allows us to"
"service our customers in a timely and efficient manner. In 2008, we processed approximately 6.8"
"billion pounds of milk, primarily into butter and cheese. Butter is produced by separating the"
"cream from milk, pasteurizing it and churning the cream until it hardens into butter. Butter"
"production levels fluctuate due to the seasonal availability of milk and butterfat. The cheese"
"manufacturing process involves adding a culture and a coagulant to milk. Over a period of hours,"
"the milk mixture hardens to form cheese. During that time, whey is removed and then separately"
"processed. Finally, the cheese is salted, shaped and aged."

"<DIV style=font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif>"
"<DIV align=left style=font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Supply and Raw Materials. </I>Our principal raw material for production of dairy products is"
"milk. During 2008, we sourced approximately 91% of our raw milk from our members. We enter into"
"milk supply agreements with all of our dairy members to ensure our milk supply. These contracts"
"typically provide that we will pay the producer an advance for the milk during the month of"
"delivery and then will settle the final price in the following month for an amount determined by us"
"which typically includes a premium over Federal market order prices. These contracts provide that"
"we will purchase all of the milk produced by our members for a fixed period of time, generally one"
"year or less. As a result, we often purchase more milk from our members than we require for our"
"production operations. There are three principal reasons for doing this: first, we need to sell a"
"certain percentage (which is not less than 10% of the amount procured and depends on which Federal"
"market order the milk is subject to) of our raw milk to fluid dairy processors in order to"
"participate in the Federal market order system, which enables us to have a lower input cost for our"
"milk; second, it decreases our need to purchase additional supply from non-member dairy producers"
"during periods of low milk production in the United States (typically August, September and"
"October); and third, it ensures that our members have a market for the milk they produce during"
"periods of high milk production. We also purchase cream, bulk cheese and bulk butter as raw"
"materials for production of our dairy products. We typically enter into annual agreements with"
"fluid processors to purchase all of their cream production. We typically purchase bulk cheese and"
"butter pursuant to annual contracts. These cheese and butter contracts provide for annual targets"
"and delivery schedules and are based on market prices. In isolated instances, we purchase these"
"commodities on the open market at current market prices. We refer to this type of transaction as a"
"spot market purchase."
"</DIV>"
"<DIV align=left style=font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Customers. </I>We sell our dairy products directly and indirectly to over 500 customers. Our"
"products are sold in over 5,000 retail locations, including supermarkets and super-centers,"
"convenience stores, warehouse club stores and military commissaries. In addition, we sell our"
"products through food brokers and distributors to foodservice providers such as major restaurant"
"chains, schools, hotels and airlines."
"</DIV>"
"<DIV align=left style=font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Research and Development. </I>We seek to offer our customers product innovations designed to meet"
"their needs. In addition, we work on product and packaging innovations to increase overall demand"
"for our products and improve product convenience. In 2008, we spent $10.5&nbsp;million on dairy research"
"and development, and we employ approximately 65 individuals in research capacities at our dedicated"
"dairy products research facility."
"</DIV>"
"<DIV align=left style=font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Competition. </I>The bulk of the dairy industry consists of national and regional competitors."
"Our branded cheese products compete with products from national competitors such as Kraft, Borden"
"and Sargento as well as several regional competitors. For butter, our competition comes primarily"
"from regional brands, such as Challenge and Kellers, and from private label products. We face"
"increased competitive pressures because our retail customers are consolidating. We rely on the"
"strength of our brands to help differentiate our products from our competition. We believe our"
"branded products compete on the basis of brand name recognition, product quality and reputation and"
"customer support. Products in the private label and industrial markets compete primarily based on"
"price. We believe our product quality and consistency of supply distinguishes our products in these"
"markets."

"consolidated subsidiaries, we manufacture and market feed for both the commercial and lifestyle"
"sectors of the animal feed market in the United States. Our commercial feed products are used by"
"farmers and specialized livestock producers who derive income from the sale of milk, eggs, poultry"
"and livestock. Our lifestyle feed products are used by customers who own animals principally for"
"non-commercial purposes. Margins on our lifestyle feed products are generally higher than those on"
"our commercial feed products. We market our lifestyle animal feed products, other than dog and cat"
"food, under the brands <I>Purina, Chow </I>and the <I>&#147;Checkerboard&#148; Nine Square </I>logo. We also market our"
"animal feed products under the <I>LAND O LAKES </I>and <I>Lake Country </I>brands. We operate a geographically"
"diverse network of 79 feed mills, which permits us to distribute our animal feed nationally through"
"our network of approximately 850 local member cooperatives, approximately 3,400 independent dealers"
"operating under the Purina brand name and directly to customers."

"<DIV align=left style=font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe we are a leader among feed companies in animal feed research and development with a"
"focus on enhancing animal performance, productive capacity and early stage development. For"
"example, we developed and introduced milk replacer products for young animals, and our patented"
"product formulations make us the only US supplier of certain milk replacer products. These products"
"allow dairy cows to return to production sooner after birthing and increase the annual production"

"increase as meat processors and livestock producers become larger and integrate their businesses by"
"acquiring or constructing their own feed production facilities. In addition, purchasers of"
"commercial feed tend to select products based on price and performance and some of our feed"
"products are purchased from other third parties. As a result of these factors, the barriers to"
"entry in the feed industry are low. Distribution for lifestyle feed is also consolidating as major"
"national chain retailers enter this market. We believe we distinguish ourselves from our"

"<DIV align=left style=font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our dairy business is affected by Federal price support programs and federal and state pooling"
"and pricing programs. Since 1949, the Federal government has maintained price supports for cheese,"
"butter and nonfat dry milk. The government stands as a ready purchaser of these products at their"
"price support levels. Historically, when the product price reached 110% of its price support level,"
"the government would sell its inventory into the market, effectively limiting the price of these"
"products. Because prices for these products have generally been higher than their support level for"
"a number of years, the government currently has minimal inventories of cheese and butter. The"
"provisions for dairy price support contained in the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002"
"were renewed in the passage of the 2008 Farm Bill. The government most recently has been purchasing"
"nonfat dry milk powder at the support price. This recent activity started in October&nbsp;2008."

"<DIV align=left style=font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal and certain similar state regulations attempt to ensure that the supply of raw milk"
"flows in priority to fluid milk and soft cream producers before producers of hard products such as"
"cheese and butter. This is accomplished in two ways. First, the Federal market order system sets"
"minimum prices for raw milk. The minimum price of raw milk for use in fluid milk and soft cream"
"production is set as a premium to the minimum price of raw milk used to produce hard products. The"
"minimum price of raw milk used to produce hard products is, in turn, based upon U.S. Department of"
"Agriculture (&#147;USDA&#148;) survey data which includes market pricing of butter, nonfat dry milk (&#147;NFDM&#148;),"
"whey and cheese. Second, the Federal market order system establishes a pooling program under which"
"participants are required to send at least some of their raw milk to fluid milk producers. The"
"specific amount varies based on region, but is at least 10% of the raw milk a participant handles."
"Certain areas in the country, such as California, have adopted systems which supersede the Federal"
"market order system but are similar to it. In addition, because the Federal market order system is"
"not intended as an exclusive regulation of the price of raw milk, certain states have, and others"
"could, adopt regulations which could increase the price we pay for raw milk, which could have an"
"adverse effect on our financial results. We also pay a premium above the market order price based"
"on competitive conditions in different regions."
"</DIV>"
"<DIV align=left style=font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Producers of dairy products which are participants in the Federal market order system pay into"
"regional &#147;pools&#148; for the milk they use based on the amount of each class of dairy product produced"
"and the price of those products. As described above, only producers of dairy products who send the"
"required minimum amount of raw milk to fluid milk producers may participate in the pool. The"
"amounts paid into the pool for raw milk used to make fluid milk and soft creams are set at a"
"premium to the amounts paid into the pool for raw milk used to make cheese or butter. The pool then"
"settles with each milk handler on a weighted average price for all raw milk (including that used"
"for fluid milk and soft creams) sold in that region. The milk handler pays at least this pool price"
"to the dairy farmer for milk received. This pooling system provides an incentive for hard product"
"producers to participate in the pool (and therefore supply the required minimum for fluid milk"
"production), because the average price for raw milk received by these producers from the pool is"
"more than the average price they pay into the pool."
"</DIV>"
"<DIV align=left style=font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a cooperative, we are exempt from the requirement that we pay pool prices to our members"
"for raw milk supplied to us. However, as a practical matter, we must pay a competitive price to our"
"members in order to ensure adequate supply of raw milk for our production needs, and therefore our"
"operations are affected by these regulations."
"</DIV>"
"<DIV align=left style=font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we did not participate in the pool, we would not receive the advantage of the average pool"
"payment and we would not be able to pay our milk producers as much as participating processors"
"without incurring higher costs for our raw milk. To maintain our participation in the Federal"
"market order program and avoid this competitive disadvantage, we must procure at least 110% of our"
"raw milk requirements to meet our production needs. If we are unable to procure at least 110% of"
"our requirements, we would have lower production which could have a material adverse affect on our"
"results of operations. In addition, if the pool was eliminated we would be subject to additional"
"market forces when procuring raw milk, which could result in increased milk costs and decreased"

"<DIV align=left style=font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business segments operate in highly competitive industries. In addition, some of our"

"<DIV align=left style=font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The animal feed industry is highly fragmented, with the bulk of the industry consisting of"
"many small local manufacturers, several regional manufacturers and a limited number of national"
"manufacturers. However, as meat processors and livestock producers become larger they tend to"
"integrate their business by acquiring or constructing their own feed production facilities. As a"
"result, the available market for commercial feed may become smaller and competition may increase,"
"which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. In addition, purchasers of"
"commercial feed tend to select products based on price and performance. Furthermore, some of our"

"to approve Roundup Ready<SUP style=font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top>&#174;</SUP> Alfalfa in 2005. The Monsanto Company and several independent alfalfa"
"growers also filed motions to intervene in the lawsuit. On March&nbsp;12, 2007, the United States"
"District Court for the Northern District of California (the &#147;Court&#148;) issued a preliminary"

"final EIS to be completed by the end of 2009. Although the Company believes the outcome of the"

"March&nbsp;2001, the Company responded to the EPA denying any responsibility with respect to the costs"

"negotiations with the EPA to perform selected remedial action for remaining contamination and to"
"resolve the Company&#146;s potential liability for the Site. In the Letter, the EPA claimed that it has"
"incurred approximately $21.0&nbsp;million in response costs at the Site through October&nbsp;31, 2007 and is"
"seeking reimbursement of these costs. The EPA has also stated that the estimated cost of the"
"selected remedial action for remaining contamination is $9.6&nbsp;million. The Company maintains that"
"the costs incurred by the EPA were the direct result of damage caused by owners subsequent to the"
"Company, including negligent salvage activities and lack of maintenance. In addition, the Company"
"is analyzing the amount and extent of its insurance coverage that may be available to further"

"applied to a real estate transaction in 2005. The consolidated financial statements as of and for"
"the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, and the notes thereto, are adjusted to reflect the correction of"
"these errors. The adjustments relate primarily to correcting fair value purchase price allocations"

"and mix them at the farm location rather than purchasing a complete feed product delivered to the"
"farm. Producers may purchase grain blends and concentrated premixes from separate suppliers. This"

"improved product mix, favorable ingredient cost positions and lower energy costs. Within the"
"livestock category, margins increased in grass cattle and swine by $1.8&nbsp;million and $6.5&nbsp;million,"
"respectively. Horse and companion animal feeds accounted for the largest increases in the"

"implied fair value. Implied fair value is the excess of fair value of the reporting unit over the"

"Company&#146;s long-lived assets, management relies on a number of assumptions including operating"
"results, business plans, economic projections, and marketplace data. While the Company currently"

"maintain an appropriate balance between fixed and floating interest rate exposures. These swaps"
"mirrored the terms of the 8.75% senior unsecured notes and effectively converted $102&nbsp;million of"
"such notes from a fixed 8.75% rate to an effective rate of LIBOR plus 385 basis points. On"
"September&nbsp;11, 2007, the Company terminated its interest rate swap arrangement in order to rebalance"

"Excess Benefit Savings Plan is to provide a restoration benefit to executive officers who"
"participate in the above-described 401(k) Plan. We offer this restoration benefit to executive"
"officers as part of a market-competitive package of benefits that facilitates attraction and"
"retention of executive officer talent."
"</DIV>"
"<DIV align=left style=font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive officers can earn the 401(k) Company match on earnings up to the annual maximum"
"recognizable compensation limit set by law. On earnings above this amount, we cannot provide a"
"match into the 401(k) Plan. The Non-Qualified Excess Benefit Savings Plan restores the match"
"opportunity lost by application of federal limits."
"</DIV>"
"<DIV align=left style=font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restoration is accomplished by making a contribution to the executive officer&#146;s deferred"
"compensation account. The contribution represents 3% of total compensation (net of any deferred"
"compensation) less the amount of the Company match contributed to the 401(k) Plan. Amounts"
"contributed to named executive officers in 2008 are included in the &#147;All Other Compensation&#148; column"
"of the &#147;Summary Compensation Table&#148;. The amounts contributed are part of the total deferred"

"Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan is to provide to a select group of employees an"

"it is a prevalent practice in the market that supports attraction and retention of talent."

"<DIV align=left style=font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, employees with base salaries equal to or in excess of $110,000 are eligible under"
"this plan, which includes all of our executive officers. Activity within this plan for named"
"executive officers is displayed in the &#147;Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation&#148; table."
"</DIV>"
"<DIV align=left style=font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible employees may elect to defer a minimum of $1,000 up to a maximum 30% of base"

"Deferred compensation is included as compensation for purposes of the Company&#146;s Pension Plan and"
"for the Company Retirement Contribution element of the 401(k) Plan. In order to restore the 401(k)"
"match a participant could forego by deferring compensation in this plan, the Company adds an"
"additional amount equal to 3% or 4% of the participant&#146;s elective deferrals to this plan. The 4%"
"addition is provided to those executive officers who participate in the enhanced 401(k) plan"
"described above."

"<DIV align=left style=font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each year of participation, starting in 2005, participants have a separate account for"
"each year of participation. Participants elect a distribution schedule for each yearly account,"
"covering the events of death, disability, retirement and termination, which allows for distribution"
"in monthly installments over one to ten years. A participant can elect alternatively to have a"
"distribution made while still in active status, payable in annual installments of one to five"
"years. If a participant does not elect a distribution schedule for an account, we impose a default"
"distribution schedule of monthly installments over a five year period. A participant can elect to"
"re-defer scheduled payments, but must do so by following restrictive guidelines that conform to IRC"
"409A. There is no provision in the plan that allows for an acceleration of payment, except in the"
"event of a documented hardship. For participants with an account balance in place through December"
"31, 2004, greater flexibility is provided for changing distribution schedules, as these balances"
"are operated under the &#147;grandfather&#148; provisions of IRC 409A."
"</DIV>"
"<DIV align=left style=font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All participant accounts are credited with interest on a quarterly basis at a rate announced"
"in advance of each calendar year. The crediting rate in 2008 was 6.85%. A Grantor Trust was"
"established in 1996 to pay benefits from this plan and from the Non-Qualified Excess Benefit Plan"
"(IRS Limits). As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, the asset balance in the Trust was approximately $3,000."

"to: the valuation of certain assets contributed to and acquired by MoArk during the calendar years"
"2000, 2001 and 2002; the Company&#146;s accounting treatment applied in 2003 for the planned purchase of"
"the remaining 42.5% minority interest in MoArk; and the accounting treatment applied to a real"
"estate transaction in 2005. The consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended"
"December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006, and the notes thereto, are adjusted to reflect the correction of these"
"errors. The adjustments relate primarily to correcting fair value purchase price allocations for"
"the original contributions upon formation of MoArk, for business combinations during the years"
"2000, 2001 and 2002, and for the Company&#146;s purchase of the remaining 42.5% minority interest in"

"and liabilities and have recorded the fair value adjustments to the Company&#146;s consolidated"
"financial statements from fiscal year 2000 and forward. In preparing these fair value adjustments,"
"the Company&#146;s management, among other things, consulted with an independent advisor. The"
"adjustments also include recording the 2005 real estate transaction in accordance with Statement of"

"<DIV align=left style=font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return for"
"the assets in the qualified, defined benefit pension plan. Historical markets are studied and"
"long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income are preserved consistent with"
"the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater"
"return over the long run. Current market factors, such as inflation and interest rates, are"
"evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. Diversification and"
"rebalancing of the plan assets are properly considered as part of establishing the long-term"
"portfolio return. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to assess for reasonableness. The"
"Company determined its discount rate assumption at year end based on a hypothetical double A yield"
"curve represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates from one-half to 30&nbsp;years."
