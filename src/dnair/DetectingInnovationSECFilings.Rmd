### I. Introduction

***OSLO Definition of Innovation***
***Background on BRDIS***

This project aims to test the feasibility to identify, measure, and characterize product innovation using non-survey data sources. Our goal is to develop methods to complement and enhance the BRDIS survey that collects information from a representative set of companies and asks whether they have introduced a new product to the market. Specifically, we are developing text-based methods to determine:

* whether a company has launched a new product?
* how many new products are introduced?
* what are the features of the new product(s)?
* how that innovation trends over time?

To answer these questions, we levy our text-based methods against administrative data, specifically financial filings. We measure innovation in terms of products, and seek to capture a new product and characterize its trajectory across a number of text based sources. Additionally, we focus on the pharmaceutical and medical device industry that are highly regulated such that new products require approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We make the assumption that the FDA approval dataset (which is publicly available) is the universal set of all new products, and ask what the portion of these products we can capture using administrative and opportunity data. Their respective SIC codes are given here. 

```{r illustrate_industries_1}
knitr::kable(distinct(sic[SIC_SIC %in% c(2834, 3841), 3:4])) 
# originally referenced the actual files - and there are some filings that weren't in these two industries
```

We chose to focus on the pharmaceutical and medical device industry because of the strictly regulated process of launching new products that is specific to this industry. Consider the following as a high-level illustration of the process a new drug or medical device might take to the market:

1. *Research & Development:* Company undertakes research to develop, test, and trial new device and drug. 
2. *FDA Application:* Company submits application to FDA for device or drug approval.
3. *Approval Announcements: FDA releases announcements to the public. 
4. *Press Activity:* Media outlets report on the announcements, company and competitor relationships, and launches to market.
5. *Market Activity:* Company retails device or drug.
6. *Financial Reports:* Company submits financial reports to US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC). 

```{r illustrate_counts_1}
compcount1 <- origcomp_details %>% 
    count(SIC_Industry) 

compcount2 <- ciknames %>% 
  left_join(sic, by = c("CIK", "SEC_SIC" = "SIC_SIC")) %>% 
  count(SIC_Industry) 

compcount3 <- allwordcounts %>% 
  count(Company, Year) 

compcount4 <- allregwords %>% 
  count(Company, Year) 
```


By tracing products through their lifecycle from FDA approval through financial impact, we can expand upon the BRDIS survey results by providing additional context and information around what innovation looks like in the pharmaceutical industry. Furthermore, we can illustrate a process by which innovation can be uncovered and measured, at least in a highly regulated environment.

### II. Data Sources 

##### A. SEC Filings

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is an indepdendent agency created by the 1934 Securities Exchange Act. As an arm of the federal government, the SEC's primary responsibilities lie in the regulation of the nation's securities, which refer to any financial instruments used in trade. These responsibilities include oversight of the national stock and options exchanges. Publicly traded companies are those that are those companies whose equity is distributed through shares that are traded on a stock exchange, and thus, their oversight falls too to the SEC. Public companies are required to disclose their financial performance annually to the SEC, via lengthy reports that often cover a wide range of topics including (but not limited to):

* company history
* organizational structure
* financial statements
* earnings per share
* corporate hierarchy
* executive compensation

The 10-K form is one such report filed by publicly traded companies. These filings are comprehensive reports that summarize and break down the company's financial performance into a number of dimensions. The form itself consists of the following sections:

1. Overview of business: *What products and services does the company provide? How does it conduct its main operations?* 
2. Foreseeable risks: *What risks pose threats to the company's future?*
3. Highlighted financial data: *How has the company performed recently?*
4. Management discussion and analysis: *How does the company explain its performance from the previous fiscal year?*
5. Financial statements and supplementary data: *What other materials help to explain the company's position?*

The reports represent sources containing rich and detailed information about the companies and present an opportunity to glean data of interest from its text. 

This work makes use of filings submitted by companies belonging to the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Our primary aim is to capture full product names from the yearly SEC 10-K filings. Once captured, these names will represent the universe of drugs and devices associated with companies who submitted these filings. *** For the purposes of this work, we treat drugs and devices mentioned in the 10-K filings as our product innovations. ***


***

##### B. Food & Drug Administration 

The U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) is a different federal agency, created by the 1906 Pure Food and Drugs Act and housed within the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. As an extension of the federal executive department, the FDA's primary responsibilities lie in the regulation of food products, drugs, and other substances, including: 

[source](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/history-fdas-fight-consumer-protection-and-public-health )

* tobacco products
* prescription drugs (synthetics, synthesized in lab)
* over-the-counter drugs (synthetics, synthesized in lab)
* vaccines
* biopharmaceuticals (biologics, extracted from biological sources)
* blood transfusions
* medical devices
* electromagnetic radiation emitting devices
* cosmetics
* ~~ animal foods & feed~~
* ~~ veterinary products~~

[source](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-basics/what-does-fda-regulate)

Here, we focus on a subset of these products: medical devices and drugs. Drugs, for this work, includes any synthetic or biologic agent, regardless of its accessibility (whether it is available over-the-counter (OTC) or whether it requires prescription). Development of new treatments, on a whole, is an extremely complex process, often requiring several years of clinical trials to determine the safety and efficacy of a new treatment as well as evaluate and weigh its potential risks.

***FDA Approvals***

All companies seeking to develop, manufacture, or distribute new drugs or medical devices must seek approval from the FDA. The approval processes differ between drugs and medical devices. They must submit either a New Drug Application (NDA) or, depending on the novelty and the ***invasiveness*** (word choice) of their device,  file for pre-market notifications or approvals. 

Here, we use the FDA approvals as a candidate for our single source of truth for innovations. We take the FDA approvals of drugs and devices as our reliable, known universe of *actual* innovation. This necessitates the assumption that all innovations in drugs and medical devices must go to and through the FDA for review prior to availability on the market, per the OSLO definition of innovation.

[metadata](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/drugsfda-data-files)
[[MISSING]] - link to where the FDA data came from originally, drugs @ fda 


***National Drug Codes***

In addition to the drug and medical device approvals, the FDA also furnishes a database of product identifiers for drugs, referred to as the National Drug Code (NDC). The Drug Listing Act of 1972 mandated collection of this data to facilitate FDA regulation of the manufacture and distribution of drugs. The NDC is particularly useful to this work, as the 1-11 digit numeric identifier is comprised of 3 component identifiers. The first indicates the labeler, the company involved in the manufacture, repacking, or distribution of a drug product. The second indicates the product, which represents not only the formulation of the drug, but also the strength and dosage specific to the company's product portfolio. The third indicates the packaging form and size, also specific to the company's product portfolio.

Code | Length  | Meaning
-----|--------|---------
NDC|10-11 digits| product identifier, given per company
*Labeler*| 5-6 digits | company identifier
*Product*| 3-4 digits | product identifier
*Package*| 1-2 digits | packaging designation

Our goal is to identify mentions of product launches for a given year using the 10-K filings of pharmaceutical companies. This is a challenging task, given the hundreds of filings in our dataset and the thousands of words within each filing. We specifically needed to find a way to: 

1. limit the body of text down to sections of the filings that describe products 
2. identify specific words most likely to represent a product

Below we step through our iterative process using one of the filings as an example (#1 above), and then walk through our two approaches for product capture (#2)

##### A. Text ingestion of SEC 10-K filings

First the text of all filings was ingested, such that each text element represented an observation of the dataset. An example SEC filing can be found here: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/310158/000119312512084319/d274705d10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/310158/000119312512084319/d274705d10k.htm).

Here's the text using the above linked Merck filing as an example. 

```{r illustrate_sectext_1}
url <- "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/310158/000119312512084319/d274705d10k.htm"
edgar <- read_html(remove_doc_types(read_file(url)))
paragraphs <- edgar %>% 
  xml_find_all( ".//p") %>% 
  html_text() %>%
  str_squish

paragraphs <- paragraphs[dataplumbr::var.is_blank(paragraphs) == FALSE] #[c(1,5,7,10,11,12, 16, 64)]
merck_example <- paragraphs[c(1,5,7,10,11,12, 16, 64)]
#knitr::knit_print(merck_example) 
data.frame("Merck" = merck_example[1:7]) %>% knitr::kable() %>% kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "float_right")
```

There were `r length(paragraphs)` text elements overall in this filing. For each of these text elements, we selected only those elements that were at least 20 characters. This reduces the example from its original size at `r length(paragraphs)` elements by `r length(paragraphs) - length(paragraphs[nchar(paragraphs)>20])` to `r length(paragraphs[nchar(paragraphs)>20])` elements. 

```{r illustrate_sectextbylength_1}
#knitr::knit_print(merck_example[nchar(merck_example) > 20])
#format(merck_example[nchar(merck_example) > 20])
data.frame("Merck" = merck_example[nchar(merck_example) > 20]) %>% knitr::kable() %>% kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "float_right")
```


##### B. Candidate Product Capture

Given the 10-K filing of a company, our goal is to identify mentions of product launches for a given year. This requires identifying product names in these filings, and finding those that are mentioned as being launched in the respective year. Currently, we are developing two parallel approaches which will be combined eventually. The first one involves obtaining non-English words in a filing and identifying those that are used in close "proximity" with our keywords of innovation, i.e., launch, new product (list to be expanded). Among the `r length(file_names)` filings, `r nrow(compcount3) ` referenced non-English words in their filings. The second approach is to identify names that are used with a trademark or a registered trademark sign.

We wanted to determine the number and names of the new products and took two approaches to capturing candidate product words in the SEC 10-K filing text. 

**1. Searching text for non-English words**

We then wanted to identify text elements that contained our target innovation phrases, so we looked for elements that contained the phrase "launch" or "new product." As you can see, it looks like the keyword "launch" identified a product called "Zetia."
```{r illustrate_sectextbykeyword_1}
word_innov <- c("launch", "new product")
innov_text <- which(grepl(paste(word_innov, collapse = "|"), tolower(paragraphs)) == TRUE)

knitr::knit_print(paragraphs[innov_text][11]) #%>% kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "float_right")

```

Then, for these paragraphs containing "launch" or new product, we looked for any non-English words in these text elements. We do see "Zetia" in this list! 

```{r illustrate_sec_nonenglish_1}
#knitr::kable(allwordcounts[Company == 310158][1:5])
allwordcounts[Company == 310158][1:5] %>% knitr::kable()
```


**2. Searching text for protected brands**

Second, for any paragraph, we looked for any word with a "Registered" or "Trademarked" symbol adjacent to it. Below, you can see some registered and trademarked tokens we hope to match to our existing word list. Note that this list can include both English and non-English words. 

```{r}
protectedunique <- unique(allregwords$Words)
#knitr::knit_print(head(protectedunique, 3))
head(protectedunique, 3)
```

```{r illustrate_sec_protected_1}
#knitr::knit_print(protectedunique[protectedunique %in% c("Click®", "Coach®", "Blue®" )])
protectedunique[protectedunique %in% c("Click®", "Coach®", "Blue®" )]
```

##### C. Refine Capture Results

Ideally, all words captured by these two approaches would represent true product names; however, we observe that the list of words that we have obtained from the filings can also include (i) company names or (ii) sector-specific terms. Therefore,  dictionaries for these groups need to be generated to identify and eliminate them. In other words, we need to refine our results.  

```{r illustrates_refine_problem_2}
wordlist_enreg_count[wordlist_enreg_count$Token %in% c("Abbvie", "ANDA", "Mallinckrodt", "Pharma", "AstraZeneca", "Bausch"),c("Token", "n")] %>% 
  group_by(Token) %>% 
  summarise(n = sum(n)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

#wcbyword_findcompanies %>% count(complowTF, Self, Pharma) %>% knitr::kable()
```


**1. Company Names **

We needed to create a reference set, or a dictionary of unique company tokens. Once compiled, we could find words in our candidate product list that actually represent company names and remove them from our final list. 

1. Create company name stop words (e.g., incorporated, inc)
2. Combine company names from a variety of sources
    a) SIC
    b) SEC
    c) Stock Exchanges
3. Create columns to optimize matches
    a) Concatenate string of all names across CIK codes
    b) Tokenize company names
    c) Lower case of company tokens
    d) Stem company tokens
4. Reduce set
    a) remove single character tokens
    b) remove company name stop words 
    c) remove repeating tokens (tokens appearing for more than 1 company)

```{r illustrate_tokens_per_company}
new_ref_companies2 %>% filter(str_detect(CompanyString, "Dorato Resources Inc")) %>% 
  #select(c(1,2, 19, 20)) 
  select(c(1, 20)) %>% knitr::kable()
```


**2. Industry Terms**

Similarly, for words thats... Create dictionary generic industry terms

1. Create a summary set of tokens ranked by number of total appearances
2. Manually evaluate tokens with over 10 appearances
3. Create list of generic industry terms

```{r illustrate_industry_terms}

wcbyword_searchcompanies %>% 
  filter(str_detect(string = word_low, pattern = pharmstopwords) ==  TRUE) %>% 
  select(Token) %>% count(Token) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  head(4) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```


**3. Compare candidate product captures to dictionaries**

1. Generate regular expressions patterns
    a) `r length(unique(new_ref_companies$Tokens)) ` company name tokens
        i) original
        ii) lower case
        iii) stemmed token
    b) `r length(pharmstopwords) ` industry terms
2. Create wordlist columns to optimize matches
    a) Lower case of tokens
3. Apply regular expressions patterns to wordlist resulting from Step 3
4. Remove words from wordlist that match either dictionary

```{r}
wcbyword_findcompanies %>% 
  select(Token, complowmatch, CompanyString, Self, Pharma) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  filter(Token %in% c("AbbVie", "HUMIRA", "LASIK", "Akorn", "ANDA", "Antihemophilic")) %>%
  filter(CompanyString %in% c("ABBOTT LABORATORIES NA Abbott Laboratories", "AKORN INC NA Akorn Inc", "BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC Baxter International Inc")) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

##### D. Validate Captures















```{r plotsettings2}
customPlot2 = list(
  theme(#plot.margin = unit(c(1,1,2,2), "cm"),
        axis.text.x  = element_text(vjust=0.5, size=12),
        plot.title=element_text(size=12, vjust=2),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#FFFFFF") , 
        legend.position="right"),  #coord_flip(), 
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Key", ncol = 1),
        colour =guide_legend(title="Key", ncol = 1))
)
```

```{r plotsettings_3}
customPlot3 = list(
  theme(axis.text.x  = element_text(vjust=0.5, size=12), #plot.margin = unit(c(1,1,2,2), "cm"),
        plot.title=element_text(size=12, vjust=2),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), #axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#FFFFFF") , 
        legend.position="bottom"), 
  coord_flip(), 
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Key", ncol = 3),
        colour =guide_legend(title="Key", ncol = 3))
)

```

```{r}
# pal_ind <- wes_palette("GrandBudapest1", 3, type = "discrete")
# pal_5 <- wes_palette("Moonrise3", 5, type = "discrete")

library(RColorBrewer)
myCol <- brewer.pal(3, "Pastel2")
myCol <- brewer.pal(3, "Pastel2")
```

### Results

The results presented below align with the methodology outlined previously, and illustrate the outputs of each step of this work. 

##### Results of SEC filing text ingestion the text of an SEC filing

As shown in Table X, a total of 779 companies across the pharmaceutical and medical device industries submitted a total of 703 10-K filings to the SEC. These filings were submitted over the years 2012-2018; however, the bulk of the observations fall in the years 2013-2017 and as mentioned previously, the pharmaceutical industry submits more filings than does the medical device industry. All together, these 703 filings consisted of over 4 million words with the bulk of filings showing sizes under 50,000 words. It is also interesting to note that on a whole, the filings submitted by pharmaceutical companies are decidely longer in word count than those by medical device companies.   

This portion of the research focused on the last stage of the lifecycle: whether a new product appears in the financial activities of a company. For this we used the SEC's EDGAR database of 10-K filings. Using the criteria of the two industries of interest, we identified `r length(unique(ciknames$cik))` companies in their database as belonging to the pharmaceutical/medical device industries. Of these, `r nrow(unique(orig_companies))` filed 10-K forms with the SEC, which report on their financial well-being as a company. 


Table below summarizes the number of companies on Edgar.

Company Sets | N            | Subset with 10-K Filings
------------- | -------------|----------
Total Number of Pharma Companies on Edgar | `r length(unique(ciknames$CIK))` | `r nrow(unique(orig_companies))`
SIC 2834: Drugs| `r as.integer(compcount2["1",2]) ` | `r as.integer(compcount1["2",2]) `
SIC 3841: Devices | `r as.integer(compcount2["2",2]) ` | `r as.integer(compcount1["3",2]) `


We collected the 10-K filings of the `r nrow(unique(orig_companies))` companies for the years 2013--2016, which makes a total of `r length(file_names)` filings. 

Filings Sets | N
------------- | -------------
Total 10-K Filings  | `r length(file_names)`
10-K Filings w non-English | `r nrow(compcount3) `
10-K Filings w Protected Brand | `r nrow(compcount4) `



```{r}
filing_years <- str_extract(file_headers$X1, pattern = "\\d{0,4}$")
filing_comps <- as.numeric(str_extract(file_headers$X1, pattern = "^\\d*"))
filings <- tibble(filing_years, filing_comps) %>% left_join(ciknames, by = c("filing_comps" = "CIK"))
#table(filings$filing_years)

filings_wc <- allwords %>% count(Company, Year) 
ciknames$cik2 <- as.double(ciknames$CIK)
filings_wc <- filings_wc %>% left_join(ciknames, by = c("Company" = "cik2"))
filings_wc2 <- filings_wc %>% group_by(Year,SEC_SIC) %>% summarise(sum = sum(n), mean = mean(n))
```


The 4 million words from the filings break out fairly evenly across the years 2013-2017 by total words across all filings. Because 2012 and 2018 have only 2 and 4 filings respectively, we are not surprised that these filings show very low total word counts. On a whole, filings typically seem to show lengths under 5,000 words.

<div class="col2">
```{r}
ggplot(data = filings, aes(x=as.factor(filing_years), fill = as.factor(SEC_SIC))) +
  geom_bar( position = "dodge") +
  customPlot2 +
  scale_fill_manual(values = myCol, na.translate = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "How many filings were submitted each year?", subtitle = "Filings Over Years Per Industry", x = "Years", y = "Number of Filings")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = filings_wc, aes(x=(n), fill = as.factor(SEC_SIC))) +
  geom_bar(binwidth = 1000, position = position_dodge2(preserve = "single")) +
  customPlot2 +
  scale_fill_manual(values = myCol, na.translate = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "On a whole, how long are filings?", subtitle = "Filing Word Count Distribution", x = "Number of Words ", y = "Number of Filings")
```

</div>

When considering the 4 million words by mean words per filing, we look at how filing length changes over time by total words submitted and average filing size by word count. By total words submitted, the years appears to trend with the total number of filings. The average filing length by word count is similarly even for years 2013-2017, but, interestingly, shows year 2012’s 2 pharmaceutical filings with much greater average length than all other years and year 2018’s 4 pharmaceutical filings with much lower average length than all other years. 

***QUESTION Based on this, should we exclude 2012?***

<div class="col2">
```{r}
ggplot(data = filings_wc2, aes(x=as.factor(Year), y = (sum/1000), fill = as.factor(SEC_SIC))) +

  customPlot2 +
  scale_fill_manual(values = myCol, na.translate = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "How do filings change in total length over years?", subtitle = "Total Words Across All Years of Filings", x = "Years", y = "Number of Words (Thousands)")
```

```{r}

##### Results of candidate product capture

```{r}
filings_wc_capture <- wordlist_enreg_count %>% left_join(ciknames, by = c("Company" = "cik2")) %>% group_by(Year,SEC_SIC) %>% summarise(sum = sum(n), mean = mean(n))
```

When considering the 16,815 candidate product words captured over the years, we note the difference in scale on the number of words identified as candidate products from the original 4 million words. For 2016, for example, just over 20,000 words were identified as candidate products from the original 800,000 words submitted across filings for that year.  We also find that the pharmaceutical industry seems to trend with the filing count, but the medical device industry appears to show fewer captures overall. Interestingly, the two industries are fairly similar in the number of captures per filing. 


<div class="col2">
```{r}
ggplot(data = filings_wc_capture, aes(x=as.factor(Year), y = (sum/1000), fill = as.factor(SEC_SIC))) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge2(preserve = "single")) +
  customPlot2 +
  scale_fill_manual(values = myCol, na.translate = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Total Captures Across All Years of Filings", x = "Years", y = "Number of Words (Thousands)")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = filings_wc_capture, aes(x=as.factor(Year), y = mean, fill = as.factor(SEC_SIC))) +

  scale_fill_manual(values = myCol, na.translate = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Average Captures Across All Years of Filings", x = "Years", y = "Number of Words")
```
</div>

##### Results of dictionary generation

To reduce our word-capture list to those words that most likely represent a product name that can be attributed back to a company, we generated two dictionaries of company names and industry terms that help clean the results of our word capture.  

###### A) Company Names



Company Name Set                     | N
-------------------------------------|--------
Total Company Names                  | `r nrow(company_reference_names)`
Uniquely Identifiable Company Names  | `r length(unique(new_ref_companies$CompanyString))`
Non-Unique Company Names             | `r length(setdiff(unique(new_ref_companies2$CompanyString), unique(new_ref_companies$CompanyString)))`

Company Token Set    | N
---------------------|--------
Total Company Tokens | `r nrow(new_ref_companies2)`
Unique Company Tokens| `r length(new_ref_companies$Tokens)`
Repeat Company Tokens| `r nrow(multtokens)`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
company_reference_names # string concatenated
new_ref_companies # unique tokens
new_ref_companies2 # all tokens

sum(multtokens$n) + nrow(new_ref_companies) # 252127 repeat tokens + 27929 unique tokens = 280056 total tokens

nrow(new_ref_companies2) # all tokens #280056 total tokens
length(new_ref_companies$Tokens) # unique tokens
nrow(multtokens) # repeat tokens

length(unique(company_reference_names$CompanyString)) # 59303 - total company names
length(unique(new_ref_companies$CompanyString)) # 22184 - uniquely identifiable company names
length(setdiff(unique(new_ref_companies2$CompanyString), unique(new_ref_companies$CompanyString))) # 37119 non-uniquely identifiable company names
```

###### B) Pharmaceutical Industry terms

We find 16 terms that altogether represent 246 observations. 

```{r}
knitr::knit_print((c("biopharma", "therapeutics?", "pharmaceuticals", "international", "sciences", "medical", "technology",  "pharma", "bio", "biosciences", "anda", "fdca", "uspto", "investigational")))
```






DISCUSSION

##### C. Limitations
***QUESTION Where should this section go? Discussion? Introduction?***

For the purposes of this work, we treat drugs and devices mentioned in the 10-K filings as our product innovations. 

* products can be mentioned by companies who didn't create them
* products can be mentioned in years after they were brought to market
* 10-K filings intended to discuss financial performance; innovation is part of story but not true goal
* products without a brand protection or whose names consist entirely of English words are missed
* products with same name as company are missed
* companies whose names do not consist of unique tokens are not removed from candidate product capture 
* possibility of products outside of FDA?
