	Benlysta 

	Marketed by:

	GlaxoSmithKline (Research Triangle Park, NC) and Human Genome Sciences (Rockville, MD)

	Indication:

	The FDA approved Benlysta (belimumab) for the treatment of adult patients with active, autoantibody-positive, systemic lupus erthematosus who are receiving standard therapy. Benlysta is the first of a new class of drugs called B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS)–specific inhibitors. Belimumab blocks the binding of soluble BLyS, a B cell survival factor, to its receptors on B cells. It does not bind B cells directly, but belimumab inhibits the survival of B cells and reduces the differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells by binding with BLyS. The efficacy of Benlysta has not been evaluated in patients with severe active lupus nephritis or severe active central nervous system lupus or in combination with other biologics or intravenous cyclophosphamide.

	Dosage Form:

	Single-use vials of belimumab lyophilized powder: 120 and 400 mg/vial
