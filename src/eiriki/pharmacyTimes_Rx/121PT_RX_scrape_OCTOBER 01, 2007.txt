  Selzentry Tablets
 
  Marketed by:
 Pfizer Inc (New York, NY)
  Indication:
 August 6, 2007-The  FDA approved Selzentry  (maraviroc) Tablets, the  first in a new class of oral HIV medications in more  than 10 years. Selzentry blocks viral entry into white  blood cells, significantly reducing viral load and  increasing T-cell counts in treatment-experienced  patients infected with a specific type of HIV. Selzentry  is the first in a class of drugs known as CCR5 antagonists,  which block the CCR5 coreceptor, the virus' predominant  entry route into T cells. Selzentry stops the  R5 virus on the outside surface of the cells before it  enters, rather than fighting the virus inside, as do all  other classes of oral HIV medicines.
