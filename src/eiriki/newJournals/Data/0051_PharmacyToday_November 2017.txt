Copanlisib (Aliqopa—Bayer) targets relapsed follicular lymphoma, a slow-growing type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, in adults who have received at least two prior treatments. The drug is a kinase inhibitor that works by blocking several enzymes that promote cell growth.
In a single-arm trial that included 104 patients with follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who had relapsed disease following at least two prior treatments, 59% of patients had complete or partial shrinkage of their tumor for a median of 12.2 months.
Common adverse effects include hyperglycemia, diarrhea, decreased general strength and energy, hypertension, leukopenia or neutropenia, nausea, lower respiratory tract infections, and thrombocytopenia.
Serious adverse effects include infections, hyperglycemia, hypertension, noninfectious pneumonitis, neutropenia, and severe skin reactions. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take copanlisib because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby.
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was FDA approved under the trade name Mylotarg (Pfizer) for patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) whose tumors express the CD33 antigen, and for patients aged 2 years and older with CD33-positive AML who have experienced a relapse or who have not responded to initial treatment.
Mylotarg originally received accelerated approval in May 2000 as a stand-alone treatment for older patients with CD33-positive AML who had experienced a relapse. It was voluntarily withdrawn from the market after subsequent confirmatory trials failed to verify clinical benefit and demonstrated safety concerns, including a high number of early deaths.
This new approval includes a lower recommended dose, a different schedule in combination with chemotherapy or on its own, and a new patient population.
Common adverse effects are fever, nausea, infection, vomiting, bleeding, thrombocytopenia, swelling and sores in the mouth, constipation, rash, headache, elevated liver function tests, and neutropenia.
Severe adverse effects include low blood counts, infections, liver damage, hepatic veno-occlusive disease, infusion-related reactions, and severe bleeding.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take Mylotarg because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or a newborn baby. Patients with hypersensitivity to Mylotarg or any component of its formulation also should not use it.
Mylotarg carries a boxed warning about severe or fatal liver damage, including veno-occlusive disease or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome.

FDA approved oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension 6 mg (base)/mL (Nesher Pharmaceuticals), a generic of Tamiflu, for treatment of influenza A and B in patients aged 2 weeks and older who have had influenza symptoms for no more than 48 hours, and for prevention of influenza in patients aged 1 year and older.
This first generic is of particular importance for patients who are not able to ingest capsules. The most common adverse effects in clinical trials were nausea, vomiting, and headache.

Bevacizumab-awwb (Mvasi—Amgen), a biosimilar to bevacizumab (Avastin), has been approved for the treatment of adult patients with multiple types of colorectal, lung, brain, kidney, and cervical cancers.
Approval was based on review of evidence that included extensive structural and functional characterization, animal study data, human pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data, clinical immunogenicity data, and other clinical safety and effectiveness data that demonstrates bevacizumab-awwb is biosimilar to Avastin. Bevacizumab-awwb has not been approved as an interchangeable product.
Common expected adverse effects include nosebleeds, headache, high blood pressure, rhinitis, proteinuria, taste alteration, dry skin, rectal bleeding, excessive tear production, back pain, and skin irritation.
Serious adverse effects include perforation or fistula, arterial and venous thromboembolic events, hypertension, problems in brain function or structure (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome), proteinuria, infusion-related reactions, and ovarian failure. Patients should stop using bevacizumab-awwb if these adverse effects become severe or life-threatening.
Women who are pregnant should not take bevacizumab because it may cause harm to a developing fetus. Bevacizumab-awwb should not be given to patients with severe hemorrhage or to patients who cough up blood.

Abemaciclib (Verzenio—Eli Lilly) is indicated for adult patients with hormone receptor (HR)–positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer that has progressed after endocrine therapy.
It is approved to be given in combination with an endocrine therapy, fulvestrant, after the cancer has grown on endocrine therapy. It is also approved to be given on its own in patients who were previously treated with endocrine therapy and chemotherapy after the cancer had spread.
Abemaciclib works by blocking cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, which are involved in promoting growth of cancer cells.
Common adverse effects are diarrhea, neutropenia and leukopenia, nausea, abdominal pain, infections, fatigue, anemia, decreased appetite, vomiting, and headache.
Serious adverse effects include diarrhea, neutropenia, elevated liver blood tests, and blood clots. Women who are pregnant should not take abemaciclib because it may cause harm to a developing fetus.

FDA approved a new formulation of insulin aspart injection 100 units/mL under the trade name Fiasp. The fast-acting mealtime insulin improves glycemic control in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
Common adverse reactions (excluding hypoglycemia) are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, diarrhea, and back pain.
Fiasp can be dosed at the beginning of a meal or within 20 minutes after starting a meal. It will be available in a prefilled delivery device (Flex-Touch pen) and a 10-mL vial.
Durolane (Bioventus) is a single-injection, hyaluronic acid product used for joint lubrication to treat pain associated with knee osteoarthritis. Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring molecule that provides the lubrication and cushioning in a normal joint.
Patients should not use the product if they have infections or skin disease at the injection site. Durolane has not been tested in pregnant or lactating women or in children.
Risks can include transient pain, swelling, and stiffness at the injection site.
A 32-mg dosage of bosentan (Tracleer—Actelion) is now available for children aged 3 years and older with idiopathic or congenital pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The agent was originally approved in 62.5- and 125-mg dosages in November 2001 to improve exercise ability and reduce clinical worsening in adults with PAH. The new tablet is scored to allow weight-based dose adjustment for younger patients.
Because bosentan can cause hepatotoxicity and birth defects, it is available only through a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program. The 32-mg tablets are expected to be available by the end of 2017.

UCB announced a new indication for brivaracetam (Briviact) as monotherapy for partial-onset (focal) seizures (POS) in patients aged 16 years and older with epilepsy. It was originally approved as adjunctive treatment for POS in patients in this age group.
The most common adverse reactions are somnolence and sedation, dizziness, fatigue, and nausea and vomiting symptoms.
The agent is available in three formulations: film-coated tablets, oral solution, and injection.
Eslicarbazepine acetate (Aptiom—Sunovion) has a new indication for children as young as 4 years old who have POS. It was previously approved for adults with POS.
The once-daily, immediate-release antiepileptic can be taken whole or crushed, with or without food.
Approval of the agent for this indication was based on FDA guidance that permits extrapolation of data to support pediatric use. Data from three clinical trials support its safety and tolerability in pediatric patients.
