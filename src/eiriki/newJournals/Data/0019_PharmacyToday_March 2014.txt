FDA expanded the approved use of ibrutinib (Imbruvica—Pharmacyclics, Janssen Biotech) to treat patients who have received at least one previous therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
Safety and effectiveness of ibrutinib for CLL were based on a study of 48 previously treated patients who were diagnosed with CLL 6.7 years before the study and had received previous therapy. Approximately 58% of participants had their cancer shrink after treatment, with a duration of response ranging from 5.6 to 24.2 months.
