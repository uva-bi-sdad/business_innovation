Wound-Be-Gone
Marketed by:
Wake Pharm US Inc (Bellwood, IL)
Indication:
Wound-Be-Gone uses
a unique combination
of highly effective
moist healing and patented free oxygen binding
technology to heal wound and skin injuries. The moist
environment supports the movement of cells and
maintains a constant temperature in the wound, which
is critical for quick healing without scars. The active
ingredient neutralizes free oxygen radicals and creates
an elastic layer that prohibits contact between the
wound and its external environment. This prevents the
wound from becoming contaminated and speeds up
the healing process. The topical gel contains no antibiotics,
medication, or biological materials.
