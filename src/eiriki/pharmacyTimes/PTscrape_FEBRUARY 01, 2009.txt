Breathe Again
Marketed by:
Breathe Again
(New York, NY)
Indication:
Breathe Again is
a unique, natural
seawater nasal
spray that cleanses
and soothes
stuffy noses
and helps them
breathe freely again. Breathe Again is a hypertonic
solution, not isotonic. A hyertonic solution contains
more salt than an isotonic solution. It also has a
higher concentration of salt than the fluid around
the nasal membranes. When the product is misted
into the nasal passages, its higher salt content
draws fluid away from the nasal membranes,
effectively reducing swelling and easing congestion.

Enzymedica Inc

Indication:
Reduce is a dietary supplement
that combines the enzyme
glucoreductase along with
cinnamon extract, chromium
picolinate, and zinc gluconate.
The nutrients have been shown
to provide significant benefit for
healthy blood sugar regulation.
The enzymes in Reduce work
by forming soluble fiber, and
the additional ingredients support
the body by transporting sugar from the blood
into the body's cells, safely reducing serum glucose
levels. This process makes insulin work more efficiently
and helps combat insulin resistance. Reduce is
available in 30- and 90-count capsules.
