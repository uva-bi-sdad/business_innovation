Spenco Rx Diabetic Support Foot Beds 


Marketed by:
Spenco Medical Corp (Waco, Tex) 


Indication:
Many patients with diabetes have artery and nerve disease, which makes them prone to ulcers and infections that can lead to lowerextremity amputation. Patients must be protected from shearing, friction, and pressure. The Spenco Rx Diabetic Support Foot Beds are designed to provide total contact and to evenly distribute an individual's weight over a greater surface area, thus preventing ulcers from developing. This is accomplished by using specialized medical foams that mold to the bottom surface of the foot, filling in the complete topography of the foot. The top layer of the foot bed is made of Plastazote foam, which offers memory impression and impacts absorption to evenly distribute pressure, relieving sensitive areas of the foot. The bottom layer is made with a lightweight EVA base that is body-heat-activated. Over time, it will mold to the unique shape of the foot to give a precise level of support. The Spenco Rx Diabetic Support Foot Beds retail for $29.99.
