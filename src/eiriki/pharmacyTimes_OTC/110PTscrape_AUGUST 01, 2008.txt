NasalCEASE
Marketed by:
Catalina Healthcare (Mendon, NY)
Indication:
NasalCEASE is the
quick and convenient
way to treat nosebleeds.
The nasal
packing is a naturalbased
polymer (calcium
alginate). As
soon as the polymer
comes in contact with blood it releases calcium, a
coagulant, to actively stop the bleeding quickly. The
polymer absorbs up to 20 times its weight, allowing
the individuals to insert the packing and forget about
it until removal 30 minutes later. NasalCEASE does
not tear new clots when removed and there are no
rebleeds that are often caused when using other
items in the nose. NasalCEASE works fast and provides
the convenience that individuals are looking for
in dealing with their nosebleeds.
