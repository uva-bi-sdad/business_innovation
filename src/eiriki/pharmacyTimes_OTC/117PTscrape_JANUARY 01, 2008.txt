AZO Cranberry

Marketed by:
Amerifit Brands
(Cromwell, CT)


Indication:
AZO Cranberry is a supplement
for urinary tract health
(UTH) that has been reformulated
to provide even
higher levels of protection.
The new AZO Cranberry,
now lactose free, adds probiotic Lactobacillus sporogenes
and vitamin C to the 450 mg of natural cranberry
powder concentrate found in the previous formulation.
Two AZO Cranberry tablets now contain 900 mg
of natural cranberry powder concentrate, 100 million
colony-forming units of probiotic Lactobacillus sporogenes
to impede the colonization of bad bacteria and
stimulate the immune response, with 60 mg of vitamin
C, which acts as an antioxidant to help neutralize
the number of free radicals in the body. Free radicals
hinder good health at the cellular level, so maintaining
cellular health protects UTH. AZO Cranberry is now
available in blister packaging (replacing the former
bottle) and comes with a new Spanish-language product
information insert. A 50-count package retails for
$8.99.
