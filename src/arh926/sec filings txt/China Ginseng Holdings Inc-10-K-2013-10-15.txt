China Ginseng Holdings
 Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;
 together with its subsidiaries
 herein referred to as &#8220;we&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221;) was incorporated on June 24
 2004 in the State of Nevada.&#160;Since our inception in 2004
 we have been engaged in the business of farming
 processing
 distribution and marketing of fresh ginseng. Starting August 2010
 we have gradually shifted our business focus from farming and selling ginseng to producing and selling ginseng juice and wine with our crops as raw materials
 although we still maintain our farming and selling ginseng business. Through leases
 we control 3
705 acres of land approved by the Chinese government for ginseng planting and approximately 750 acres of grape vineyards which are harvested annually. However
 recent harvests of grapes showed poor quality for wine production which indicates that the vineyards are no longer suitable for planting grapes for wine production. Therefore
 we have decided not to renew our lease for the vineyards with the Chinese government upon expiration on December 31
 2013 and
 going forward we intend to purchase grapes from the open market in order to produce grape juice and wine.




Below is a chart of our organizational structure as of June 30
 2013:





Note: All the four wholly foreign owned enterprises except Tonghua Linyuan have duly obtained the approval from the relevant government. Pursuant to PRC laws
 a wholly foreign owned enterprise needs to apply for and obtain an approval certificate from the competent approval government authorities (the Ministry of Commerce of PRC or its local branch) and then a business license from the competent registration authorities (the Administration for industry and commerce of the PRC or its local branches) before it legally starts its business operation. Each of the four foreign owned enterprises has not only obtained the approval certificate from the competent local approval government authorities but also the business license for the competent local registration authorities.


On August 8
 2006
 six PRC regulatory agencies
 including the Ministry of Commerce of the People&#8217;s Republic of China
 the China Securities Regulatory Commission
 the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council
 the State Administration of Taxation
 the State Administration for Industry and Commerce
 and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange
 jointly amended and released the Merger &amp; Acquisition Rules
 which became effective on September 8
 2006 (the &#8220;2006 M&amp;A rules&#8221;). This regulation
 among other things
 includes provisions that purport to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle formed for purposes of overseas listing of equity interest in PRC companies and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals obtain the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle&#8217;s securities on an overseas stock exchange. However
 the 2006 M&amp;A rules do not apply to any foreign owned enterprise.&#160;&#160;Our PRC wholly owned subsidiaries
 Jilin Ganzhi
 Yanbian Huaxing and Jilin Huamei
 became wholly foreign owned enterprises before September 8
 2006.&#160;&#160;Therefore
 the 2006 M&amp;A rules are not applicable to Jilin Ganzhi
 Yanbian Huaxing or Jilin Huamei.&#160;&#160;Tonghua Linyuan became a wholly foreign owned enterprise after September 8
 2006.&#160;&#160;According to the 2006 M&amp;A rules
 where a special purpose company is to be listed overseas for transaction
 it shall be subject to the approval of the securities regulatory organization under the State Council of the PRC.&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the said rules
 the &#8220;special purpose company&#8221; refers to an overseas company directly or indirectly controlled by a domestic company or Chinese person to realize the interests of a domestic company actually owned by the aforesaid domestic company or Chinese person by means of overseas listing.&#160;&#160;The current shareholders of Tonghua Linyuan are not the original shareholders of Tonghua Linyuan before Tonghua Linyuan became a wholly foreign owned enterprise on January 15
 2008.&#160;&#160;Thus the Company is not of the opinion that China Ginseng Holdings
 Inc. is a &#8220;special purpose company&#8221; as defined in the 2006 M&amp;A rules.&#160;&#160;As a result
 we believe that our structure is not subject to the 2006 M&amp;A rules.





























On September 8
 2003
 we and Jilin Dunhua Huaxing Ginseng Industry Co
&#8221;
 a PRC company) jointly and legally established Yanbian Huaxing as a joint venture company
 in which we held 25% equity interest and Dunhua Huaxing held 75% equity interest. We received a certificate of approval issued by the competent local approval authority on September 8
 2003 and a business license issued by the competent local registration authority on September 16
 2003. On November 24
 2004
 we and Dunhua Huaxing adjusted the registered capital of Yanbian Huaxing and our respective shareholding percentage in Yanbian Huaxing
 and
 as a result
 we then held 55% equity interest in Yanbian Huaxing. Subsequently in August 2005
 we acquired the remaining 45% equity interest from Dunhua Huaxing at a purchase of $164
000
&#8221;). The purchase prices were determined based upon the registered capital of Yanbian Huaxing of $364
000. In October 2005
 we increased the registered capital of Yanbian Huaxing by putting in an additional $250
000 in order to meet the requirement for foreign owned enterprise requirement for tax purpose. Now the registered capital of Yanbian Huaxing is $614
000. We have applied with the relevant PRC approval and registration authorities for each of the aforesaid changes and have obtained all applicable approvals and registrations for such changes
 including a certificate of approval issued by the local approval authority and a renewed business license issued by the local registration authority certifying Yanbian Huaxing as a WFOE lawfully owned by us. Yanbian Huaxing is operated to plant ginseng and our revenue in the past was mainly from the sales of ginseng produced and sold by Yanbian Huaxing. With the shift of our business focus to canned ginseng juice
 we have started to reserve the high quality grown ginseng for ginseng beverage production and sold only those not qualified to make ginseng juice. However
 due to excessive rain in the year ended June 30
 2011
 90% of our grown ginseng was oxidized and sold to the market. During the year ended June 30
 2013
 we were unable to reserve our grown ginseng for ginseng juice production
 compared with 20% in the year ended June 30
 2012.


















On May 31
 2006
 we acquired 100% equity interest in Jilin Ganzhi at a price of $95
691.&#160;&#160;We received a certificate of approval issued by the competent local approval authority on May 31
 2006 and a business license issued by the competent local registration authority on June 19
 2006.&#160;&#160;Subsequently on September 26
 2007 and August 31
 2008 we increased Jilin Ganzhi&#8217;s registered capital by $50
000 and $20
000 respectively.&#160;&#160;Now the registered capital of Jilin Ganzhi is $100
000. We have applied with the relevant PRC approval and registration authorities for each of the aforesaid capital increases and have obtained all applicable approvals and registrations for such changes
 including a renewed certificate of approval issued by the local approval authority and a renewed business license issued by the local registration authority certifying Jilin Ganzhi as a WFOE lawfully owned by us. Jilin Ganzhi is operated to process ginseng and produce canned ginseng juice. Jilin Ganzhi started production of canned ginseng juice in the three months ended December 31
 2010.


















On January 15
 2008
 we acquired 100% equity interest in Tonghua Linyuan from two PRC individual shareholders at a price of $1
000
000.&#160;&#160;The price was determined by arm&#8217;s-length negotiations based upon the appraised net asset value of Tonghua Linyuan at the time of acquisition which was approximately $1
332
248. We received a certificate of approval issued by the competent local approval authority on January 15
 2008 and a business license issued by the competent local registration authority on April 1
 2008 certifying Tonghua Linyuan as a WFOE lawfully owned by us.&#160;&#160;However
 the WFOE certificate is conditioned on us injecting the registered capital into Tonghua Linyuan before or on June 15
 2012. Because we failed to satisfy this condition
 Tonghua Linyuan lost its status as a WFOE beginning June 15
 2012. Tonghua Linyuan was operated to plant grapes and produce wine.&#160; However
 recent harvests from Tonghua Linyuan showed poor quality for wine production which indicates that the vineyard is no longer suitable to grow grapes for grape juice and wine production. Therefore


 Tonghua Linyuan contracted for the production of wine with a winery producer whereby Tonghua Linyuan provides the producer with grape juice and supplies and producer charges processing fee per bottle. Tonghua Linyuan started&#160;wine production through a winery producer in March 2011 and the sales of wine were&#160;conducted through Jilin Huamei and Hong Kong Huaxia.




When we acquired Tonghua Linyuan
 it was in debt as a result of a loan of 2
000
000 RMB (about $316
211) to Ji&#8217;An Qingshi Credit Cooperatives (&#8220;Ji&#8217;An Qingshi&#8221;). Therefore
 we were responsible for paying back the loan after we acquired Tonghua Linyuan. The principal terms of the loan are as follows:





































Loan Amount: Principal of 2
000
000 RMB (about USD $316
211) with an annual interest of 6.325%













Loan Period: From February 4
 2002 to February 4
 2003; Repayment due date was February 4
 2003

































Until now
 we have not paid any principal or interest of the loan; however
 Ji&#8217;An Qingshi verbally agreed in March 2008 not to call the loan
 and that no principal or interest payments are required to be made until the Company is generating profits and interest continues to accrue until we repay the loan.


As of June 2013
 the planned production of wine and grape juice had not been commenced due to the poor quality of the harvests which were not suitable for the production of wine or grape juice
 and therefore the Company decided to abandon the growing and harvesting of grapes.&#160;&#160;On June 30
 2013
 Tonghua Linyuan entered into a sale agreement with Mr. Wenkai Wang to transfer all assets and debts of Tonghua Linyuan to Mr. Wenkai Wang for $0 (zero) consideration
 including the ownership of machinery and equipment
 the right to the use of the plant and the debt of $2 million of Tonghua Linyuan
 effective immediately. Pursuant to the sale of all assets and debts
 Tonghua Linyuan became a shell with no operations. Mr. Wang has been engaged in wine sale business in Tonghua City for many years and does not have any material relationship with the Company
 or any of its affiliates
 or any director or officer of the Company
 or any associate of any such director or officer
 other than in respect of the sale of Tonghua Linyuan. We believe that it is the best interest of the Company to dispose the assets and debts of Tonghua Linyuan. Going forward
 the Company will purchase grapes in the open market to produce wine and grape juice.&#160;















Jilin Huamei was incorporated by us on October 17
 2005 as a WFOE. We received a certificate of approval issued by the competent local approval authority on October 17
 2005 and a business license issued by the competent local registration authority on October 19
 2005 certifying Jilin Huamei as a WFOE lawfully owned by us. The registered capital of Jilin Huamei is $200
000.&#160;&#160;Jilin Huamei operates as a sales department for our canned ginseng juice and wine
 which are produced by our other subsidiaries. We plan to recruit one general distributor for our canned ginseng juice and one general distributor for our wine in each big city in China through Jilin Huamei. As of the date of this filing
 Jilin Huamei has 5&#160;general distributors for our ginseng beverage and one general distributor for our wine. Jilin Huamei established one sale branch office in Jiangsu Province from the period of June
 2011 to May
 2013. The Company decided to cease the operation of this branch because we did not have many sales from this branch and we did not have enough cash to support its operations.&#160;&#160;We commenced sales of ginseng beverage in October 2010 and&#160;Jilin&#160;Huamei started generating revenue in November 2010.




Hong Kong Huaxia International Industrial Co.
 Ltd (&#8220;Hong Kong Huaxia&#8221;)













Hong Kong Huaxia was incorporated by us on March 18
 2012 as a wholly-owned subsidiary to sell health and specialized local products. The registered capital of Hong Kong Huaxia is HKD 1
000
000 (approximately $129
032) which has not been funded by the Company
 Hong Kong Huaxia began operations in April 2012.








Our business in China is currently conducted through the above four wholly owned subsidiaries located in Northeast China. On June 30
 2013
 Tonghua Linyuan became a shell company and ceased operation pursuant to a sale of all of its assets and debts.&#160;&#160;Below is the operational status of each of these businesses as of the date of this filing:











Yanbian Huaxing: In the past
 our revenue was mainly from the sales of ginseng produced and sold by Yanbian Huaxing which consists of Ynabian farm and Mudanjiang farm. In August 2010
 we shifted our business focus to canned ginseng juice and wine and started to store fresh ginseng for producing canned ginseng juice. Most of the ginseng produced by Yanbian Huaxing has been and will continued to be used as raw material of canned ginseng juice and only those oxidized ginseng not qualified to be used for canned ginseng juice will be sold directly through Yanbian Huaxing. Therefore
 the revenues attributable to the direct sales of ginseng produced by Yanbian Huaxing have already and will continue to decrease as the ginseng is utilized for the ginseng juice. For the year ended June 30
 2012
 the sales of our ginseng production decreased by $235
237 compared to the year ended June 30
 2011.&#160;&#160;This was a decrease of 21% over the previous year caused by decreased quantity we sold to the market. Nevertheless
 because of the increase of the resale price of the ginseng we purchased and the decrease of the sales of ginseng juice due to lack of promoting activities during the fiscal year ended June 30
 2012
&#160;&#160;&#160;the sales of ginseng by Yanbian Huaxing still accounted for the biggest part of our revenue for the year ended June 30
 2012. Yanbian farm&#8217;s harvest&#160;will be substantially complete by December 31
 2012.&#160;We are only planting small amounts of Ginseng because the climate and soil conditions have deteriorated. The other farm
 Mudaniang
 will harvest no ginseng until about 2018 due to the damages caused by a typhoon strike occurred in August 2012 which will be discussed in more detail in this Form 10-K. However
 our decision to shift our business focus mainly to production and sale of ginseng juice remains unchanged. We currently have stored sufficient ginseng to produce approximately one million ginseng juice cans and we plan to continue purchasing ginseng from the market as raw material for ginseng juice production. With our unique production technology of ginseng beverage and our focus on high-end consumers
 we anticipate that
 in the next five years
&#160;around 70% of our revenue will come from sales of ginseng beverage.&#160;&#160;Nevertheless
 there is no assurance that our sales of ginseng beverage will generate 70% of our revenues in the next five years.





























Jilin Ganzhi: Jilin Ganzhi has been processing fresh ginseng and started producing canned ginseng in the quarter ended December 31
 2010 and the revenue is reflected in the financial statements in this Form 10-K for the year ended June 30
 2012.















Tonghua Linyuan: Prior to June 30
 2013
 Tonghua Linyuan operated our vineyards to grow and crush the grapes and reserve grape juices for wine production. Our grapes grew on 750 acres of land leased from a group of individual farmers
 paying approximately $37.50 per acre a year for 15 years. However
 recent harvests of grapes from Tonghua Linyuan vineyard showed poor quality which indicates that the vineyard land was no longer suitable for the production of wine or grape juice. Therefore
 we decided not to renew the land use rights with the local government when it expired on December 31
 2013. In the future
 we will keep the business of producing wine
 but we decided not to produce grape juice. We plan to purchase grapes in the open market for the production of wine. Accordingly
 we have abandoned the vineyard and recorded a charge to operations of $872
658. In addition
 Tonghua Linyuan contracted with a winery whereby Tonghua Linyuan will provide the winery with grape juice and supplies and the winery will produce wine with certain processing charge per bottle. Tonghua Linyuan started&#160;wine production through the winery producer&#160;in March 2011 and sales in April 2011. For the year ended June 30
 2013
 none of our revenue was generated from sales of wine
 compared to 5.4% for the fiscal year 2012. On June 30
 2013
 Tonghua Linyuan became a shell company and ceased operation pursuant to a sale of all of its assets and debts
 including the ownership of machinery and equipment
 the right to the use of the plant and the debt of $2 million of Tonghua Linyuan. Following the transaction
 the purchase of grapes juice and sale of wine will be conducted through our subsidiary
 Jilin Huamei. We estimate that 5% of our revenues will come from sales of wine in the next five years; however
 there is no&#160;assurance such performance.















Jilin Huamei: Jilin Huamei operates as a sale department for canned ginseng juice and wine. Our domestic market promotion and penetration of canned ginseng juice and wine is conducted by Jilin Huamei and all of our domestic distribution agreements for sales of our canned ginseng juice and wine are signed through Jilin Huamei. Pursuant to the sale of all assets and debts of Tonghua Linyuan as of June 30
 2013
 Jilin Huamei will also conduct the purchase of grapes from the openmarket for the production of our own wine.














Hong Kong Huaxia: Hong Kong Huaxia was registered in Hong Kong as a sale company for health product and specialized local goods in March 2012. It was set up as a part of our adjusted marketing strategy so that we can explore the Asia Market through Hong Kong Huaxia while Jilin Huamei focuses on domestic sales. Hong Kong Huaxia started operation in April 2012 and generated approximately 9% of revenue during the year ended June 30
 2013 through sales of our ginseng juice and wine and resales of cosmetic products under the brand of Aoweisi.&#160;&#160;The focus of Hong Kong Huaxia is sales of our ginseng juice and wine in Asia market. It is currently recruiting distributors for Asia market in addition to its online shopping platform for direct sales of our ginseng juice and wine.







Previously
 through
 we focused on the farming
 processing
 distribution and marketing of Asian and American Ginseng and related byproducts in the following varieties:












 For pharmaceutical
 health supplement
 cosmetic industry and fresh consumption.














































We obtained 20 years land use rights to 3
705 acres of land approved by the local government for ginseng growing on June 12
 2005 and we have developed 3% of the land resources.


Since August 2010
 we have gradually shifted our business focus from direct sales of ginseng and ginseng byproducts to production and sale of canned ginseng juice and wine. We have started reserving most of the ginseng produced by Yanbian Huaxing for use in the planned production of canned ginseng juice and grape juice produced by Tonghua Linyuan for use in the production of wine. Meanwhile
 as there is higher standard for ginseng used in canned ginseng juice
 we are able to sell some of the ginseng produced by Yanbian Huaxing which is not qualified for use in canned ginseng juice to the market through Yanbian Huaxing. Although we have shifted our business focus to production and sale of ginseng juice and wine
 we still receive orders for ginseng and its byproducts because of our reputation in the industry for selling high-quality ginseng. We intend to maintain this part of our business even though it is no longer our business focus. In addition
 if we receive large orders for ginseng and/or ginseng byproducts
 we will directly purchase ginseng and/or ginseng byproducts from the market if we can get a lower price of the products. This part of sale of ginseng is generated on order-to-order basis and conditioned on whether we can get a lower price for such demanded products in the market.

















 we are producing two types of canned ginseng juice.































In 2008
 we started storing fresh ginseng as a raw material in a rented refrigerated warehouse. We entered into a 5 year lease agreement with Meat Union Refrigerated Warehouse for the rented refrigerated warehouse in 2008 for the rental of 160 cubic meters with a monthly rental of 57RMB (about USD $ 8.1) per cubic meter. In October 2010
 we renewed the lease agreement with a rental of 4500 RMB (about USD $678.86
 approximately $4.2 per cubic meter) per month. The principal terms of the lease agreement are as follows:




























Meat Union leases out three refrigerated warehouses for Jilin Ganzhi to store ginseng. During the refrigerated period
 Meat Union is required to keep the temperature at 12 &#8211; 15 degrees below zero
 if there are any changes of the temperature Meat Union needs to notify Jilin Ganzhi immediately. If Meat Union fails to notify Jilin Ganzhi and consequently caused the molding or rotting of ginseng
 Meat Union shall be responsible for all the losses. Jilin Ganzhi shall inspect warehouse temperature periodically.















The contracts starts from October 15
 2010 and will remain valid until terminated by the parties
 monthly rent is 4500 RMB. When Jilin Ganzhi vacates a warehouse
 both parties will renegotiate the rent for the refrigerated warehouse.





We purchased a production factory of ginseng beverage for the total consideration of 9
000
000 RMB under a written contract dated March 2
 2010. We paid 500
000 RMB (about USD $75
207) on June 24
 2010; obtained an 8 million RMB (about USD $1
203
312) bank loan from Meihekou City Rural Credit Union to pay the seller on September 10
 2010; and paid 100
000 RMB (about USD $15
041) in December 2010. The remaining balance of 400
000 RMB (about USD $60
167)&#160;was to be&#160;paid off by end of June 2010 pursuant to the written contract; however
 on March 22
 2010
 we obtained oral consent from the seller to extend the due date to December 31
 2011.&#160;&#160;We were not able to pay off the remaining balance by December 31
 2011 and the seller orally agreed to further extend the due date to the date when we have sufficient cash to pay off the remaining balance.&#160;&#160;Nevertheless
 if our cash flow do not improve and cannot obtain a further extension from the seller or the seller revokes its oral consent of extension
 the seller has the right to repossess the production factory
 confiscate the deposit paid to the seller and we will be liable to compensate the seller for an amount equivalent to 6 month&#8217;s rental expenses for using the production factory. The principal terms of the written contract are as follows:












Parties: Meihekou City Hengyide Warehouse Logistics Co.
 Ltd. (&#8220;Meihekou&#8221;) and Ganzhi Ginseng Products Co Ltd &amp; China Ginseng Holdings
 Inc. (collectively &#8220;Ginseng Group.&#8221;)































All details/content of the location
 land area and facilities that to be acquired originally by Meihekou remain unchanged. The amount of the consideration of RMB 9
000
000 (about USD$1
353
726) and the agency commission that was to be originally paid by Meihekou shall remain unchanged and payment shall be made by Ginseng Group to Meihekou.















Payment method: This agreement became effective upon date of signing
 Ginseng Group shall pay Meihekou of RMB 500
000 (about USD $75
207) before March 20
 2010
 the remaining balance shall be repaid in full by June 30
 2010.































If the remaining balance was not settled by June 2010
 Meihekou has the right to repossess the premise and confiscate the deposit paid to Meihekou. And Ginseng Group is liable to compensate Meihekou for an amount equivalent to 6 month&#8217;s rental expenses for using the premise.





Ginseng Group has not paid off the remaining balance of 400
000 RMB (about USD $60
167) until now; however
 Meihekou has orally agreed to extend the due date of the payment to the date that we have sufficient cash flow to pay off the remaining balance
 with all other terms and conditions remain the same.
















On August 30
 2012
 we paid off the 8 million RMB bank loan which we obtained from Meihekou City Rural Credit Union on November 8
 2010 by a new loan of 8 million RMB from the same lender.&#160;&#160;The principal terms of the new 8 million RMB bank loan agreement are as follows:












Parties: Jilin Ganzhi Ginseng Products Co.
 Ltd (&#8220;Jilin Ganzhi&#8221;) and Meihekou City Rural Credit Union (&#8220;Meihekou Credit Union&#8221;);















Meihekou Credit Union granted a loan of 8 million RMB (about USD $ 1
264
842 to Jilin Ganzhi to be used in calling in and refunding and the term of the loan is 24 months from August 30
 2012 to August 29
 2014.















The loan carries a benchmark interest rate which is the rate announced by the People&#8217;s Bank of China as an interest rate of same type and class of loans at the date of the loan and&#160;changes with the adjustment of national bank rate.&#160;&#160;Meihekou Credit Union calculates the interest on a monthly basis applying this annual floating rate which is payable on the 21st day of each month. The monthly interest rate of August 2012 was 10.513 and we paid interest of 94
126.63 RMB (about USD $ 14
837.81) on August 21
 2012. And we have not paid interest since September 20

* We defaulted the payment of $1 million as of August 29
 2013

 2013.


For more details of the new 8 million RMB loan agreement
 please refer to Exhibit 10.28 attached therein to our Form 10-K for fiscal year ended June 30
 2012.


In addition to canned ginseng juice
 we also shifted our business to focus on&#160;wine production. Prior to the sale of the assets of Tonghua Linyuan
 we grew and crushed the grapes from our vineyards and had the juice reserved. We contracted with Jinyuanshan Winery for the final production and bottling of the wine. According to the contract
 we shall provide Jinyuanshan Winery with grape juice
 bottling supplies and packaging supplies; pay Jinyuanshan Winery RMB 1 (about USD $0.15) per bottle for processing red wine and RMB 1.5 (about USD $0.22) per bottle for processing ice wine. We started wine production through Jinyuanshan Winery in March 2011 and sales in April 2011. Following the sale of the assets of Tonghua Linyuan
 we plan to buy grapes for our wine production from the open market.&#160;&#160;All of our wines are sold through Jinlin Huamei and Hong Kong Huaxia.&#160;&#160;For fiscal year ended June 30
 2013
 we generated revenues of $2
618 from wine sales.

We generated $3

Our ginseng sales revenue includes revenue from our ginseng production and revenue from resale of ginseng purchased from outside farmers. Our ginseng production is constituted of our own farmed ginseng production and ginseng purchased from the farmers who leased land from us. We sell ginseng directly to the market without distributors and to&#160;customers who&#160;purchase ginseng from us on an order-to-order basis. Though purchases from a few customers aggregately accounted for more than 10% of our sales of ginseng
 we do not have any written or oral agreement with those customers. We consider a purchase to be completed once cash is paid by a customer. For large orders
 as is custom in the ginseng business
 when ginseng is shipped to a customer
 the customer pays approximately 20%-30% of the invoice and is entitled to an inspection process which could take up to 60 days. Upon completion of the inspection and approval process
 the customer notifies us and sends us the balance of the invoice price
&#160;and a sale is recorded.

However
 as we have recently begun to shift the focus of our business from sale of ginseng to canned ginseng juice and wine
&#160;&#160;there is no assurance that there will be sufficient demand for our beverages and wine to allow us to operate profitably in the short term until our new products are more widely recognized and sold. Accordingly
 past revenues and other financial results will not provide a meaningful basis for future performance given the material change in our business.




Our principal executive offices are located at 1562 Jie Fang Great Road

We sell ginseng directly to the market without distributors and to customers who purchase ginseng from us on an order-to-order basis. Although purchases from a&#160;few customers aggregately accounted for more than 10% of our sales of ginseng
 we do not have any written or oral agreements with those customers. We consider a purchase is completed once cash is paid by a customer. For large orders
 as is custom in ginseng business
 when ginseng is shipped to a customer
 the customer pays approximately 20%-30% of the invoice and is entitled to an inspection process which could take up to 60 days. Upon completion of the inspection and approval process
 the customer pays the balance of the invoice&#160;and a sale is recorded.


If ginseng produced by us or the farmers who leased land from us are not qualified to produce canned ginseng juice
 we will sell it to the market. In addition
 as we have been engaged in the business of farming
 processing and selling ginseng for more than eight years
 we are very familiar with the local ginseng planting and have good connection with ginseng farmers. Therefore
 sometimes we are able to purchase ginseng with good quality from the outside farmers at a price lower than market price and then directly sell those ginseng we purchased to the market. Starting in 2008
 we began reserving fresh ginseng as raw material to produce canned ginseng juice. As of the date of this filing
 we are no longer selling fresh ginseng or dry ginseng directly to the market except such portions of our product that are not qualified for use in our canned ginseng juice and the ginseng we purchased from outside farmers which is oxidized ginseng. Ginseng's growing season&#160;is from April&#160;to September. Normally we sow the seed in April and harvest in September. Excessive rain in June to August will normally cause oxidation on the ginseng because that is the grow season for ginseng. Our average yearly rain volume in the past ten years is approximately 500 millimeter and we usually have approximately 30% of ginseng oxidized each year. However
 because we intend to produce high quality canned ginseng juice
 we apply very strict and much higher standards when we select ginseng as raw materials for ginseng juice production. Therefore
 only portion of non-oxidized with high quality grown ginseng will be reserved for ginseng juice production. For the year ended June 30
 2013
 we did not reserve any of our grown ginseng for ginseng juice production
 compared with 20% for the fiscal year 2012. Once ginseng is oxidized
 it is no longer qualified as raw material for ginseng beverage; however
 we can still sell it to the market at a lower price compared to the price of&#160;non-oxidized ginseng.

After we shifted our business focus from direct sale of ginseng to ginseng beverage and wine
 we started to store high quality&#160;fresh ginseng for the production of canned ginseng beverage. We are no longer selling fresh ginseng produced by Yanbian Huaxing except low quality ginseng or oxidized&#160;ginseng. The oxidized ginseng is&#160;not qualified for production of&#160;ginseng beverage and we usually have around 30% of ginseng oxidized each year. Therefore
 the revenues attributable to the direct sales of ginseng produced by Yanbian Huaxing have already
 and will continue to decrease as the ginseng is utilized for the ginseng juice.&#160;We sold approximately 72
035 kg ginseng in the year ended June 30
 2013
 55% of which is the low quality or oxidized ginseng and 45% of which is the ginseng we purchased from outside farmers. We sold approximately 114
084.88 kg ginseng in the year ended June 30
 2012
 45% of which is the low quality or oxidized ginseng and 55% of which is the ginseng we purchased from outside farmers.&#160; Our sales of ginseng decreased from $3
593
581for the year ended June 30
 2012 to $2
297
228 for the year ended June 30
 2013
 a decrease of 17%. Although in the long run we expect a decrease of revenue from direct sales of ginseng
&#160; a significant increase of revenue from sales of canned ginseng juice will outweigh the decrease of sales of ginseng. We shifted our business focus mainly to production and sale of ginseng beverage because we believe that there is a significant opportunity for functional drinks in China and there are currently no leading brands in the China market
 while we have unique production technology of ginseng beverage&#160;&#160;and we focus on high-end consumers. In addition
&#160;our sales of wine products decreased significantly during the year ended June 30
 2013 due to low market demand. We estimate to have 70% of our revenue from sales of canned ginseng juice
 15-20% of our revenue from sales of ginseng and 5% of our revenue from sales of our wine in next five years. However
 there is no assurance that the sales of ginseng beverage and wine will generate 70% and 5% of our revenues respectively in the next five years.




Ginseng can only be cultivated under severely limited conditions demanding an almost perfect combination of terrain
 altitude
 and temperature. The growth cycle requires 5-6 years
 although
 senior maturity can be 8 years
&#160;&#160;and once harvested
 the land can not be used again for ginseng planting for at least 25-30 years. Because the suitable lands for ginseng farming are very limited
 the key to success in this industry is to control suitable land
 as well as to continually develop techniques to increase production per acre.


We have been granted land use rights to 1
500 hectares (about 3705 acres) of land resources for ginseng planting by the local government including Yanbian farm and Mudanjiang farm. Currently
 we have planted approximately 287
984 square meters of land. Yanbian farm was substantially completely harvested by December 31
 2012.&#160;We only planted small amounts of Ginseng at Yanbian farm during the fiscal year ended June 30
 2013 because the climate and soil conditions have deteriorated. And the other farm Mudaniang will harvest no ginseng until about 2018 due to the damages caused by a typhoon strike which occurred in August 2012 which will be discussed in more details herein below in this Form 10-K. We plan to plant
 over the next 5 years
 100
000 square meters
 representing approximately 20
000 square meters per year.&#160;&#160;In the succeeding five years
 we plan to harvest approximately 60
945 square meters of Ginseng. The harvest plan by year is as follows: 2014-58
281 and 2017-2
664.

















With regard to the land resources we developed
 we have hired our own employees to plant ginseng on part of the lands. Simultaneously
 we have executed agreements with a number of local farmers to grow
 cultivate and harvest ginseng utilizing the remaining portion of the land resources. Approximately 45% of the ginseng we need is from the 3% of developed land. The farming contracts commenced in January 2008 and expired as of December 31
 2012. In connection with these agreements
 we (1) lease sections of the ginseng land to the farmers at approximately $1.5 (10 RMB) per square meter yearly
 (2) provide the seeds and fertilizer to the farmers and clear the land of large debris (these costs are capitalized by the Company and included in the Ginseng Crop inventory
 and
 (3) pay the farmers a management fee of approximately $0.50 (4.00 RMB) per square meter (the farmers are required to produce 2kg ginseng for each square meter that they manage). After harvest
 we pay the farmers the market price
 which is the price at which other non-affiliated purchasers purchase similar ginseng from other farmers
 for their ginseng. If the harvest is below 2 kg per square meter
 the difference will be deducted from the total payment for ginseng purchased. If the harvest produces more than 2 kg per square meter
 we pay $3.00 for every extra kg. In fiscal year 2013
 we purchased approximately 45% of the ginseng we needed from these local farmers. The Company decided not to renew the contracts when they expired on December 31
 2012 because the Company has harvested all ginseng from planting land we rent to farmer. We will
 however
&#160;&#160;enter into the contracts again with the local farmers when we have enough capital to plant new ginseng.








Sales of ginseng products are seasonal
 with most customers placing orders in the first and fourth quarter in any year as our ginseng is harvested in autumn
 after necessary processing procedures
 and available for sale in winter. However
 as we no longer sell these products to any significant extent
 seasonality is no longer an issue.

To produce canned ginseng juice
 we take ginseng juice extracted from fresh ginseng as the main material plus natural extracts like xylitol
 citric acid and steviosides as subsidiary ingredients. We have farming technicians periodically inspect farmers to ensure they follow our growing guidelines to control the quality of the fresh ginseng. We use low residue pesticide and biodegradable fertilizer for ginseng planting. And we use xylitol instead of sugar to lower calories. Further
 products made with xylitol do not cause a sour taste.


Currently
 there are about 10 kinds of ginseng drinks on the market; all of them are imported from Korea. The price range for those products is 4 &#8211;30 RMB per can (about USD $0.60-$ 4.51) based on our market research.


The most important component of ginseng is ginsenoside. Through reading our competitor&#8217;s labels
 we found that nearly all of their ginseng drinks are produced by blending after extracting ginsenosides through chemical methods. The extraction for ginsenosides will cause damage to its nutritional components. Our technology is different from that traditional method. We squeeze out the natural juice from fresh ginseng so as to preserve freshness and nutrition in the final product.


The reason direct squeezing is not commonly used in canned ginseng juice is that it needs fresh ginseng as a raw material and preservation of fresh ginseng is very difficult. Fresh ginseng rots very fast. The harvest time concentrates in September and October
 which is a fairly short period. After that
 one can only buy dried ginseng from market such as sun-dried ginseng from which we cannot squeeze juice. However
 our drink formula enables us to use refrigerated ginseng as a raw material to produce canned ginseng juice and still be able to maintain its freshness and nutrition in our final products. The drink formula for our ginseng beverages is a registered patent approved by the Chinese government
 patent number ZL 03111397.6. This patent was issued on January 23
 2008 and expires 20 years after issuance.

This is why we store our fresh ginseng in refrigerated warehouse space. We are currently renting a refrigerated warehouse (-20 C degree) to store all fresh ginseng inventory necessary for production of the ginseng beverages. Monthly rent for refrigerated warehouse is RMB 4
500 (about USD $676.86). We commenced production in August 2010 and sales in October 2010 which was reflected in our financial statement for the three months ended December 31
 2010. We initiated our sales of canned ginseng juice in China and we plan to expand our business to overseas markets in 2014 or 2015. Our Ganzhi Ginseng Beverage costs approximately $2.21 per 1600 ml bottle and our American Ginseng Beverage will cost approximately $2.66 per 1600 ml bottle. However
 as we are in the initial stage of ginseng beverage business
 we cannot assure the demands for our ginseng beverage will be profitable in the short term and there is no guarantee that we will be able to generate revenue with ginseng beverage business.

We own the production plant for ginseng juice. The plant is certified by the Chinese government as a Good Manufacturing Process facility
 which is required for our production of these products. Good Manufacturing Process standards cover organization and personnel
 building and facilities
 equipment
 materials
 hygiene and sanitation
 validation
 documentation
 production management
 quality management
 production distribution and recall
 complaints and adverse reactions report
 and self-inspections.
















The estimated total one-time costs associated with the production of our ginseng beverage is approximately 50 million RMB (about USD $7
549
791) including 2 million RMB for research and governmental approval
 6 million RMB for GMP adjustment construction
 8 million RMB for equipment
 11 million RMB for facility construction and upgrades
 20 million for working capital and 3 million RMB for other expenses.

We plan to fund these costs&#160;through a combination of short-term borrowings
 bank loans
 cash from operations and sales of our equity.




There are 667 cities in China.&#160;&#160;We plan to recruit one general distributor for canned ginseng juice in each city through Jilin Huamei. The general distributor can recruit the second level distributors. In addition to recruiting general distributors
 in some major cities
 Jilin Huamei will establish sale branch offices to facilitate the local sales. Our direct sale will target at customers of high end retailers such as supermarkets
 pharmacies
 hotels
 gift shops
 entertainment centers
 tourists attractions
 airport and high speed trains
 etc.


We have started negotiating distribution and sales agreements with potential general distributors. We are using a form of distribution agreement for general distributors; however
 specific terms might differ based on negotiations we have with each distributor. As of the date of this filing
 we have signed 5 distributors through Jilin Huamei. The form of the distribution agreement was filed as Exhibit 10.14 to the Form 10-12G/A we filed on November 10
 2010
 and is incorporated herein by reference.

In addition
 in order to expand our sales of ginseng juice to Asia market
 we adjusted our sales strategy and Hong Kong Huaxia was incorporated to recruit distributors in Asia market in addition to building up online shopping platform to take orders directly from end user customers.




We will obtain the fresh ginseng for beverage production from two sources
 our grown ginseng including self-planted ginseng and the ginseng sold to us by farmers in accordance with the contracts we entered into with them
 and the ginseng we purchase from the outside farmers.


Ginseng's growing season&#160;is from April to September
 six months a year. Normally we sow the seed in April and harvest in September and October. Ginseng seeds are obtained after the blossom in Autumn
 the seed can be sowed in September or next Spring
 it takes 10 days to germinate and 10 days for seeding. And the whole growing cycle for ginseng&#160;from seeding to harvest usually takes around 5-6 years to ensure the growth of ginseng and the nutrition it contains in the root. For ginseng
 every hectare can harvest 18 to 20 kg ginseng. As of June 30
 2013
 we have planted approximately 287
984&#160;&#160;&#160;square meters of land.










We are currently selling three types of wine: Bingqing Ice Wine
 Pearl in the Snow (red wine)
 Linyuan Hong Wine (red wine).

















Our grapes grew on 750 acres of land leased from a group of individual farmers
 paying approximately $37.50 per acre a year for 15 years. This lease expires on December 31
 2013
 upon which we will not further renew it. However
 recent harvests from our vineyard showed poor quality indicating the vineyard is long longer suitable for the production of wine. We decided to abandon the growing and harvesting of grapes and will now purchase grapes in the open market to produce wine.



We started production of wine in March 2011 and sales in April 2011. Through Tonghua Linyuan
 we have a written production agreement with Tonghua Jinyuanshan Winery (&#8220;Jinyuanshan Winery&#8221;) to produce Pearl in Snow Wine and Ice Wine for us from May 20
 2012 to May 19
 2017. Pursuant to the sale of all assets and liabilities of Tonghua Linyuan on June 30
 2013
 the contract with Jinyuanshan Winery will be fulfilled by our subsidiary
 Jilin Huamei. Under the terms of the agreement
 we provide Jinyuanshan Winery with grape juice
 bottling supplies and packaging supplies
 and Jinyuanshan Winery produces and bottles the wine with a charge of approximately $0.16-0.24 per bottle (approximately $0.16 a bottle for processing red wine
&#160;and approximately $0.24 per bottle for processing ice wine). Other principal terms of the agreement are as follows:
























Prior to production
 Tonghua Linyuan shall provide production guidelines and obtain approval from the city inspection department.



























Products quality: Jinyuanshan Winery must meet the quality standard set by Tonghua Linyuan
 in accordance with QB/1982-94 grape wine production standard requirement.













Products Safekeeping: After final inspection of the products
 products can be kept temporarily at Jinyuanshan Winery&#8217;s facility for up to one month. Tonghua Linyuan must ship out the products within one month.













Product defect allowance: Jinyuanshan Winery is allowed to have 5% wine production defect rate; 0.3% on labeling and packaging; and 0.5% on bottles. If the bottle damage was caused by delivery
 Jinyuanshan Winery will not be responsible for the damage.













Duration of this Contract: This contract is valid from May 20
 2009 to May 19
 2012. If there is any dispute beyond negotiation
 it will be mediated by the local arbitration authority.



























If there are any taxes incurred by Jinyuanshan Winery for processing Tonghua Linyuan&#8217;s wines
 Tonghua Linyuan is liable for paying these taxes.





We
 through Tonghua Linyuan
 have another written production agreement with Jinyuanshan Winery to produce Linyuan Hong Red for us at a charge of approximately $0.16 per bottle from May 20
 2012 to May 19
 2017. The agreement contains similar terms as the production written agreement we have with Jinyuanshan Wineary for producing Pearl in Snow Wine and Ice Wine. For more details of our wine production agreements with Jinyuanshan Winery
 please refer to Exhibit 10. 30 and 10.31 filed to our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30
 2012.


After Tonghua Linyuan ceased operations pursuant to the sale of all of its assets on June 30
 2013
 the above-mentioned contracts entered into by Tonghua Linyuan remain valid and will be fulfilled by Jilin Huamei.


The estimated total one-time costs associated with our&#160;&#160;wine production is approximately 20 million RMB (about USD $3
019
916) including 10 million RMB for working capital
 10 million RMB for grape vineyard
 wine processing
 storage
 marketing and other expenses. We plan to be funded through a combination of&#160;short-term borrowings
 bank loans
 cash from operations and sales of our equity.




Wine is produced by fermenting crushed grapes using various types of yeast. Yeast consumes the sugars in the grapes and converts them into alcohol. As of June 30
 2013
 Tonghua Linyuan did not reserve any grape juice
 compared with 1
170 tons of fermented grape juice as of June 30
 2012. As recent harvests indicated that our vineyard is no longer suitable for producing grapes for wine production
 we will now purchase grapes directly from the open market.



















There are 667 cities in China
 we intend to recruit one general distributor for wine in every city. The city level distributor can recruit the second level distributors. In addition to recruiting general distributors
 in some major cities
 Jilin Huamei will establish sale branch offices to facilitate the local sales. Our direct sale will target at customers of high end retailers such as supermarkets
 pharmacies
 hotels
 gift shops
 entertainment centers
 tourists attractions
 airport and high speed trains
 etc.


We have started negotiating distribution and sales agreements with potential general distributors. On November 16
 2010
 we entered into a distribution and sales agreement with Beijing Huayang Shengbang Trading Ltd (&#8220;Beijing Huayang&#8221;) whereby Beijing Huayang shall act as our general distributor of our wine in the Beijng area from November 16
 2010 to November 15
 2013. According to the agreement
 Beijing Huayang is authorized to sell to stores
 as well as through the channels of promotion and group purchase and to enter into sub-distribution agreements with second level distributors in the Beijing area. However
 in no circumstance
 shall Beijing Huayang sell or distribute our wine at a price less than the price we offered. Beijing Huayang shall have minimum annual sales of RMB 3
000
000 (about USD $451
242) and shall receive a bonus at certain percentage of sales exceeding the minimum sales. We used the same form of distribution agreement we use for our beverage distributors when entering into agreement with Beijing Huayang
 which was disclosed above in the Distribution Methods of Canned Ginseng Juice section. In addition
 we intend to use the same form of distribution agreement when we recruit any general distributor for our wine
 although some terms might differ based on the negotiation we have with each distributor. As of the date of this filing we have signed one wine distributor
 Beijing Huayang
 through Jilin Huamei. The distribution agreement
 expiring on November 15
 2013
 was filed as Exhibit 10. 19 in the Form 10-12G/A we filed on May 31
 2011.


In addition
 as a part of our adjustment to our marketing strategy of our ginseng juice and wine
 we have established Hong Kong Huaxia in March 2012 to recruit distributors to sell wine and ginseng juice outside China in Asia markets and to build and maintain online shopping platform to take orders directly from end user customers.






As disclosed herein
 we recently decided to stop the growing and harvesting of grapes. Wine has no seasonality.&#160;





All of our products will be sold by our subsidiary Jilin Huamei and Hong Kong Huaxia through distributors or Jilin Huamei&#8217;s sale branch offices in some major cities
 or Hong Kong Huaxia&#8217;s e-commerce.





In July 2010
 we conducted a market research program for ginseng beverages in China through a research institute
 China Lantu Hongye Research Institute. Based on the report
 management believes that there is not yet a leading brand of ginseng beverage in the China market and that the technology we use to produce our ginseng beverage will most likely provide a competitive advantage for our products in China over those currently in the Chinese market.


Other than as set forth above
 we have had no research and development expenses in the past two years.





We rely primarily on a combination of patent
 certificates and administrative protections to safeguard our intellectual property.

The drink formula for our ginseng beverages is a registered patent approved by the Chinese government
 patent number ZL 03111397.6. This patent was issued on January 23
 2008 and expires 20 years after issuance.


Although our other products have no patent protection
 our two types of ginseng beverages have been certified as PRC domestic healthcare food by SFDA (State Food and Drug Administration) and received approval certificates (&#8220;GMP Healthcare Food Certificate&#8221;) from the SFDA
 &#160;&#160;issued by SFDA on April 30
 2005
 the healthcare food applying for GMP Health Food Certificate refers to such food as claimed to have special health function or focuses on supplementing vitamins or minerals
 that is
 food which is suitable for special population
 has function of regulating the institutions instead of treating diseases
 and will not bring any acute
 sub-acute or chronic damages to the body. The application for registration of healthcare food shall be subject to an examination and approval process in which the SDFA evaluates and examines systematically the safety
 effectiveness
 quality controllability as well as the specifications of the healthcare food being applied for registration and make a decision as approving the registration or not according to the application and based on the lawful procedures
 conditions and requirements. As of the date of this filing
 we have following SFDA approval:

China is transitioning from a planned economy to a market economy. While the Chinese government has pursued economic reforms since its adoption of the open-door policy in 1978
 a large portion of the Chinese economy is still operating under five-year plans and annual state plans. Through these plans and other economic measures
 such as control on foreign exchange
 taxation and restrictions on foreign participation in the domestic market of various industries
 the Chinese government exerts considerable direct and indirect influence on the economy. Many of the economic reforms carried out by the Chinese government are unprecedented or experimental
 and are expected to be refined and improved. Other political
 economic and social factors can also lead to further readjustment of such reforms. This refining and readjustment process may not necessarily have a positive effect on our operations or future business development. Our operating revenues may be reduced by changes in China's economic and social conditions as well as by changes in the policies of the Chinese government
 such as changes in laws and regulations (or the official interpretation thereof)
 measures which may be introduced to control inflation
 changes in the interest rate or method of taxation
 and the imposition of additional restrictions on currency conversion.

China&#8217;s legal system is a civil law system. Unlike the common law system
 the civil law system is based on written statutes in which decided legal cases have little value as precedents. In 1979
 China began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and has since introduced many laws and regulations to provide general guidance on economic and business practices in China and to regulate foreign investment. Progress has been made in the promulgation of laws and regulations dealing with economic matters such as corporate organization and governance
 foreign investment
 commerce
 taxation and trade. The promulgation of new laws
 changes of existing laws and the abrogation of local regulations by national laws could have a negative impact on our business and business prospects. In addition
 as these laws
 regulations and legal requirements are relatively recent
 their interpretation and enforcement involve significant uncertainty.

We are subject to many general regulations governing business entities and their behavior in China and in any other jurisdiction in which we have operations. In particular
 we are subject to laws and regulations covering food
 dietary supplements and pharmaceutical products. Such regulations typically deal with licensing
 approvals and permits. Specifically
 these regulations concern Good Manufacturing Practices and SFDA approval as discussed above. Any change in product licensing may make our products more or less available on the market. Such changes may have a positive or negative impact on the sale of our products and may directly impact the associated costs in compliance and our operational and financial viability. Such regulatory environment also covers any existing or potential trade barriers in the form of import tariff and taxes that may make it difficult for us to export our products to certain countries and regions
 such as Japan
 South Korea and Hong Kong
 which would limit our international expansion.


Because we are a wholly foreign owned enterprise
 we are subject to the law on foreign investment enterprises in China
 and the foreign company provisions of the Company Law of China
 which governs the conduct of our wholly owned subsidiary and its officers and directors. Additionally
 we are also subject to varying degrees of regulations and permit system by the Chinese government.





 jointly issued by the Ministry of Commerce for the People&#8217;s Republic of China and the National Development and Reform Commission in 2007 classified various industries/business into three different categories: (i) encouraged for foreign investment; (ii) restricted to foreign investment; and (iii) prohibited from foreign investment. For any industry/business not covered by any of these three categories
 they will be deemed industries/business permitted to have foreign investment. Except for those expressly provided restrictions
 encouraged and permitted industries/business are usually 100% open to foreign investment and ownership. With regard to those industries/business restricted to or prohibited from foreign investment
 there is always a limitation on foreign investment and ownership. The PRC Subsidiary&#8217;s business does not fall under the industry categories that are restricted to
 or prohibited from foreign investment and is not subject to limitation on foreign investment and ownership.




Foreign currency exchange in the PRC is governed by a series of regulations
 &#160;&#160;(1996)
 as amended


 as amended. Under these regulations
 the Renminbi is freely convertible for trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions
 but not for direct investment


 Foreign Investment Entities may purchase foreign exchange without the approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange for trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions by providing commercial documents evidencing these transactions. They may also retain foreign exchange
 subject to a cap approved by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange
 to satisfy foreign exchange liabilities or to pay dividends. However
 the relevant Chinese government authorities may limit or eliminate the ability of foreign investment entities to purchase and retain foreign currencies in the future. In addition
 foreign exchange transactions for direct investment
 loan and investment in securities outside the PRC are still subject to limitations and require approvals from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.
















On July 21
 2005
 the PRC government changed its decade old policy of pegging its currency to the U.S. currency. Under that policy
 the Renminbi is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. This change in policy has resulted in an approximate 21% appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar between 2005 and 2008. However
 the PRC government decided to repeg the Renminbi to U.S. Dollars in response to the financial crisis in 2008. On June 19
 2010
 China ended the peg of Renminbi to the U.S. Dollar which allowed a greater flexibility of its exchange rate. There remains significant international pressure on the appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. Dollar.


We have evaluated the determination of our functional currency based on the guidance in ASC Topic
 &#8220;Foreign Currency Matters
&#8221; which provides that an entity&#8217;s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates; normally
 that is the currency of the environment in which an entity primarily generates and expends cash. On our own
 our operation is conducted in China and we currently financed ourselves in Chinese Renminbi. Therefore
 our functional currency is the Chinese Renmibi in accordance with the guidance in ASC 830-10-85-5.

While the Company uses United States dollars (&#8220;U.S. Dollar&#8221; or &#8220;US$&#8221; or &#8220;$&#8221;) for financial reporting purposes
 the subsidiaries within the Company maintain their books and records in their respective functional currency
 being the primary currency of the economic environment in which their operations are conducted. Because our past and current revenue from our subsidiaries are denominated in Renmibi
 assets and liabilities of a subsidiary with functional currency other than U.S. Dollar are translated into U.S. Dollars using the applicable exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Items on the statements of income and comprehensive income and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates during the reporting period. Equity accounts are translated at historical rates. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the Company&#8217;s financial statements are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income. To the extent any of our future revenues are denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar
 we would be subject to increased risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and operating results since operating results are reported in United States dollars and significant changes in the exchange rate could materially impact our reported earnings.

Under these regulations
 foreign investment entities in the PRC may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits
 if any
 determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition
 foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC are required to set aside at least 10% of their respective accumulated profits each year
 if any
 to fund certain reserve funds unless such reserve funds have reached 50% of their respective registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. The board of directors of a foreign investment entity has the discretion to allocate a portion of its after-tax profits to staff welfare and bonus funds
 which may not be distributed to equity owners except in the event of liquidation.



On August 29

 &#160;&#160;or Notice 142
 to further regulate the foreign exchange of foreign investment entities. According to the Notice 142
 foreign investment entities shall obtain verification report from a local accounting firm before converting its registered capital of foreign currency into Renminbi
 and the converted Renminbi shall be used for the business within its permitted business scope. The Notice 142 explicitly prohibits foreign investment entities from using Renminbi converted from foreign capital to make equity investments in the PRC
 unless the domestic equity investment is within the approved business scope of the foreign investment entity and has been approved by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange in advance.


















In October 2005
 the State Administration of Foreign Exchange issued the
 or the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Notice 75
 which became effective as of November 1
 2005
 and was further supplemented by two implementation notices issued by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on November 24
 2005 and May 29
 2007
 respectively. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange Notice 75 states that PRC residents
 whether natural or legal persons
 must register with the relevant local State Administration of Foreign Exchange branch prior to establishing or taking control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas equity financing involving onshore assets or equity interests held by them. The term &#8220;PRC legal person residents&#8221; as used in the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Notice 75 refers to those entities with legal person status or other economic organizations established within the territory of the PRC. The term &#8220;PRC natural person residents&#8221; as used in the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Notice 75 includes all PRC citizens and all other natural persons
 including foreigners
 who habitually reside in the PRC for economic benefit. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange implementation notice of November 24
 2005 further clarifies that the term &#8220;PRC natural person residents&#8221; as used under the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Notice 75 refers to those &#8220;PRC natural person residents&#8221; defined under the relevant PRC tax laws and those natural persons who hold any interests in domestic entities that are classified as &#8220;domestic-funding&#8221; interests.

PRC residents are required to complete amended registrations with the local State Administration of Foreign Exchange branch upon: (i) injection of equity interests or assets of an onshore enterprise to the offshore entity
 or (ii) subsequent overseas equity financing by such offshore entity. PRC residents are also required to complete amended registrations or filing with the local State Administration of Foreign Exchange branch within 30 days of any material change in the shareholding or capital of the offshore entity
 such as changes in share capital
 share transfers and long-term equity or debt investments and these changes do not relate to return investment activities. PRC residents who have already organized or gained control of offshore entities that have made onshore investments in the PRC before the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Notice 75 was promulgated must register their shareholdings in the offshore entities with the local State Administration of Foreign Exchange branch on or before March 31
 2006.

Under the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Notice 75
 PRC residents are further required to repatriate into the PRC all of their dividends
 profits or capital gains obtained from their shareholdings in the offshore entity within 180 days of their receipt of such dividends
 profits or capital gains. The registration and filing procedures under the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Notice 75 are prerequisites for other approval and registration procedures necessary for capital inflow from the offshore entity
 such as inbound investments or shareholders loans
 or capital outflow to the offshore entity
 such as the payment of profits or dividends
 liquidating distributions
 equity sale proceeds
 or the return of funds upon a capital reduction.

 provides that an income tax rate of 20% may be applicable to dividends payable to non-PRC investors that are &#8220;non-resident enterprises&#8221;. Non-resident enterprises refer to enterprises which do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC
 or which have such establishment or place of business in the PRC but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business
 to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC. The income tax for non-resident enterprises shall be subject to withholding at the income source

&#160;and the dividends paid to us by our subsidiary in the PRC are considered income sourced within the PRC
 such dividends may be subject to a 10% withholding tax.
















Such income tax may be exempted or reduced by the State Council of the PRC or pursuant to a tax treaty between the PRC and the jurisdictions in which our non-PRC shareholders reside. For example
 the 10% withholding tax is reduced to 5% pursuant to the


The new tax law provides only a framework of the enterprise tax provisions

Any increase in the combined company&#8217;s tax rate in the future could have a material adverse effect on its financial conditions and results of operations.




The Food Safety Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China as adopted at the 7th Session of the Standing Committee of the 11th National People&#8217;s Congress of the People&#8217;s Republic of China and effective on June 1
 2009
 governs the food safety in food production and business operation activities. Pursuant to the Food Safety Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China
 food producers must establish an internal inspection and record system for raw materials and predelivery products
 and food distributors must also establish internal systems to record and inspect food products procured from suppliers. In addition
 any food addictives that are not in the approved government catalog must not be used and no food products can be sold inspection-free.



The Regulations on the Implementation of the Food Safety Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China as adopted at the 73rd Standing Committee Meeting of the State Council on July 8
 2009 and effective on July 20
 2009
 are promulgated in accordance with the Food Safety Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China. The Regulations require that the local People&#8217;s Government at or above the country level shall perform the responsibility specified in the Food Safety Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China
 improve the ability for supervision and administration of food safety
 ensure supervision and administration of food safety; establish and improve the coordination mechanism between food safety regulatory authorities
 integrate and improve the food safety information network
 and realize the sharing of food safety and food inspection information and other technical resources.



The Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China on Quality and Safety of Agricultural Products was adopted at the 21st Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Tenth National People&#8217;s Congress on April 29
 2006. This Law was enacted in order to ensure the quality and safety of agricultural products
 maintain the health of the general public
 and promote the development agriculture and rural economy. Pursuant to this Law
 agricultural products distribution enterprises shall establish a sound system of inspection and acceptance for their purchases. In addition
 agricultural products that fail to pass the inspection based on the quality and safety standards of agricultural products cannot be marketed.




The material regulations for the standards of wine in China are the wine standard (GB 15037) and the wine labeling law (GB 10344) both of which are administered by General Administration of Quality Supervision
 Inspection and Quarantine of the People&#8217;s Republic of China which have the following requirements:









The name of the product is mandatory in China. The words &#8216;grape wine&#8217; should be sufficient. However
 it is advisable to qualify this with &#8216;red&#8217;
 &#8216;white&#8217;
 &#8216;sparkling&#8217;
 &#8216;semi-sparkling
 &#8216;fortified&#8217;
 &#8216;sweetened fortified&#8217; etc. As wine can be considered to be made from a single raw material
 it should be exempt from the requirement for ingredient listing. Nevertheless
 sweeteners
 preservatives and added color (legal in the case of fortified wine only) need to be declared.















































































With a view to regulate the sale of wine
 &#160;&#160;(the &#8220;Circulation Measures&#8221;) on November 7
 2005. According to the Circulation Measures
 an entity or individual that engages in wholesale or retail of alcohol (collectively &#8220;Alcohol Operator&#8221;) shall
 within 60 days as of collecting a business license
 handle the archival filing and registration in the administrative department of commerce at the same level as the administrative department for industry and commerce where the registration is handled according to the principle of territorial administration. An Alcohol Operator (supplier) shall
 when undertaking any wholesale of alcoholic goods
 fill in the Form for Registration of Alcohol Circulation (&#8220;Registration&#8221;) and record the information on the circulation of alcoholic goods in detail. The Registration shall follow the whole course of alcohol circulation
 be bundled with the goods and comply with the information on goods so as to realize the traceability of the circulation information throughout the course from the day when alcoholic goods leave the factory to the point of sales terminal. In addition
 an Alcohol Operator shall mark and sell the bulk alcohol in a fixed place. Any mobile sale of bulk alcohol is prohibited. An alcohol operator shall not sell any alcoholic goods to any minor and shall indicate this in an eye-catching position in its business place.

With a view to regulate the import and export of commodity or technology (including wine)
 &#160;&#160;(the &#8220;Registration Measures&#8221;) on June 25
 2004. The Registration Measures
 which entered into effect on July 1
 2004
 &#160;&#160;of the PRC and specify registration rules applicable to operators of commodity or technology import-export business (&#8220;Foreign Trade Operators&#8221;). Under the Registration Measures
 Foreign Trade Operators need to carry out registration for the record with the MOFCOM or the local commerce administrations authorized by it (&#8220;Local Registration Authority&#8221;). However
 operators which have obtained the qualification to operate commodity or technology import-export business prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Measures are exempt from the registration requirement unless they wish to operate outside of the already approved scope of operation. A Foreign Trade Operator should normally register with the Local Registration Authority. Upon receiving the application documents
 the Local Registration Authority must complete the registration and return the stamped registration form within five days. The Foreign Trade Operator then has thirty (30) days to complete the relevant formalities with the local customs
 inspection and quarantine
 foreign exchange
 tax
 etc. authorities.




Only SFDA and MOFCOM are required for the sale of our wine. Penalties would be levied upon us if we fail to comply with or adhere to and maintain certain standards or requirements as specified above. Such failure has not occurred in the past
 and we generally do not anticipate that it may occur in the future
 but no assurance can be given in this regard.


Excepted mentioned above
 there is no special regulations that restrict sales of our wine externally
 and we do not need other pre-approval for export. Each foreign country has different standards for importing our products; in the US for example requires FDA approval
 which we do not have and thus do not export our wine to the US. The company has no short-term plans to expand its wine export to countries outside China.


As noted above
 we have all other necessary regulatory approvals to manufacture and sell our wine in China.





We comply with the Environmental Protection Law of China and its local regulations. In addition to statutory and regulatory compliance
 we actively ensure the environmental sustainability of our operations. Our costs of compliance with applicable environmental laws are minimal
 since the manufacturing of our products generates very limited damages
 if any
 to the environment. Accordingly we had no expenditures for compliance with environmental law in 2009 and do not anticipate incurring any such costs in the future. Penalties would be levied upon us if we fail to adhere to and maintain certain standards. Such failure has not occurred in the past
 and we generally do not anticipate that it may occur in the future
 but no assurance can be given in this regard.







The market in China for ginseng is extremely competitive. Based upon management&#8217;s knowledge of the industry in China
 we believe that there are more than four companies engaged in ginseng production in China.&#160;&#160;The significant competition within the ginseng industry for planting land is compounded by the Chinese government&#8217;s recent promotion of forestation in state-owned forests.&#160;&#160;This has dramatically reduced the woodland available for ginseng planting.


Our major competitors are Changbai Baoquan Mountain
 Changbai Ni Li River
 Ji An Ginseng and Antler Company &amp; The First Fu Song Ginseng Farm.&#160;&#160;Based upon its significant knowledge of the ginseng industry in China
 management believes that we rank in the middle of these competitors
 the larger of which in general have greater financial and personnel resources and have achieved greater market penetration than we have.&#160;&#160;However
 because there are no published statistics concerning our competitors
 this is based solely upon management&#8217;s experience in the industry.
















The ranking is based on the size of ginseng planting area and shift to ginseng&#160;drinks business will not affect company&#8217;s ranking.&#160;&#160;We recently started to generate revenues from the sales of ginseng drinks. As of June 30
 2013
 we had $71
263 from the sales of ginseng drinks. We foresee that revenues from the sales of ginseng drinks will increase significantly in the future
 and we believe they will offset any loss of revenue due to the recent shift of business.


















































In the market there are about 10 kinds of ginseng beverage listed as following. The prices of these products range from approximately $0.60 to $4.51 per bottle. However
 we have noticed that there is little advertisement and promotion&#160;currently in the&#160;China market and the sales of ginseng drinks are limited.&#160;&#160;Based on the market research we conducted in July 2010 through a research institute
 China Lantu Hongye Research Institute
 the management believes there has not been a leading brand of ginseng beverage in the China market yet.

As we have just commenced sales of these products
 we are a small competitor in the market.&#160;&#160;Some of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources and all have achieved greater market penetration than we have.


We believe we have some competitive advantage in the China market due to the technology we use to produce our ginseng beverage.&#160;&#160;Based upon reading of competitors&#8217; labels
 all of their ginseng drinks are produced by blending after extracting ginsenosides through chemical methods. Management believes that the extraction for ginsenosides will cause damage to its nutritional components because high heat is used in the process of the extraction.&#160;&#160;Our technology is different from the method used by our competitors.&#160;&#160;We squeeze out the natural juice from fresh ginseng. However
 our drink formula enables us to use refrigerated ginseng as raw material to produce canned ginseng juice and still able to maintain its freshness and nutrition in final products&#160;&#160;The drink formula for our ginseng beverages is a registered patent approved by the Chinese government
 patent number ZL 03111397.6.&#160;&#160;This patent was issued on January 23
 2008 and expires 20 years after issuance. In order to store the fresh ginseng
 we rent a refrigerated warehouse (-20 C degree) to store all fresh ginseng. We currently have fresh ginseng inventory to produce approximately one million cans of ginseng juice.




We are competing with domestic producers of wine as well as importers of wines from other countries.&#160;&#160;Due to the size of our production
 we are a small competitor in the market.&#160;&#160;Some of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources and all have achieved greater market penetration than we have.


We will use grapes purchased from the open market for our wine production.&#160;&#160;As the quality of the wine substantially depends on the quality of grape juice and the location of vineyard
&#160;the principal competitors we will have in wine business will be the following companies using the grapes grown in&#160;the same area:










Jilin Provincial Changbaishan Wine Holding Co.
 Ltd.















































The climate in Changbai Mountain is ideal for growing grapes because of the significant temperature difference during day and night. It contributes to the accumulation of polyphenols and Flavonoids in grapes improving&#160;the taste and quality of the wine.&#160;&#160;In addition
 Changbai Mountian has longer cold winters. On average
 for more than 160 days per year
&#160;the temperature in Changbai Mountain falls below -45 C
 which&#160;prevents the development of&#160;&#160;pest diseases.

Based upon management&#8217;s knowledge of the industry
 we believe that more than 100 wineries have opened since 1996 and there are estimated 500 vineyards across China
 which supply almost all of the wines consumed domestically.&#160;&#160;For example
 Great Wall Winery
 one of the leading local brands in China
 produces over 50
000 tons of wine each year from its three main production areas in North China.











































































































































































































































































































































Our principal executive offices are located at 1562 Jie Fang Great Road
 16 FL&#160;&#160;Zhongji Building
&#160;&#160;Suite 1062-1063
 Nanguan District
 Changchun City
 China. The corporate headquarters occupy approximately 749.17 square meters and is on a one year lease from January 1
 2013 to December 31
 2014.&#160;&#160;Rent is approximately $500
 76 for one year.


We own free and clear the office building located in the City of Yanbian
 which is approximately 4
519 square feet
 and it is used for office/administrative purposes. We also own free and clear processing center&#160;&#160;in the City of Yanbian
 which is consisted of 7
090 square feet of space; warehouse space of 1366 square feet; and seasonal worker dormitory of 688 square feet.&#160;&#160;In the City of Yanbian
 we also own the right to use the parcel of land (129
120 square feet approximately) where these facilities are located.&#160;&#160;The land use right is for 30 years commencing November 2002 and there&#160;is no rent required due to the preferential policies.


Currently
 we&#160;rent refrigerated warehouse space of 160 cubic meters and we pay approximately $678.86 per month.&#160;&#160;The refrigerated warehouse space is 160 cubic meters
 which is not enough for our future refrigerated storage needs. We will need to at least double the space. Our current refrigerated storage space is sufficient to store 20 tons of fresh ginseng. However
 we might need more refrigerated space in the future after we start production and sales of canned ginseng juice. In the future
 we plan to build our own refrigerated warehouse
 with approximately 1
000 cubic meters storage space
 after we are able to generate stable net income from sales of our ginseng beverage and anticipate that it will take about two months to complete building.&#160;&#160;


















On June 15
 2000
 we were granted 20 years land use rights of&#160;approximately 2000 acres of Ermu Forestry land by Ermu County Government
 Tunhua.&#160;On January 8
 2005
 we entered into a land lease agreement with Heilongjiang Province Muling Forestry Bureau and Huaxing Ginseng Industry Co. for 1
750 acres of forest to grow ginseng for 20 years and pursuant to the lease agreement
 our annual aggregate lease payments are approximately $91
500.


We do not intend to renovate
 improve
 or develop properties
 except as set forth above.&#160;&#160;We do not carry property or crop insurance on our land. We have no policy with respect to investments in real estate or interests in real estate and no policy with respect to investments in real estate mortgages.&#160;&#160;Further
 we have no policy with respect to investments in securities of or interests in persons primarily engaged in real estate activities.





From time to time
 we may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business.&#160;&#160;We are not aware of any pending or threatened legal proceeding that
 if determined in a manner adverse to us
 could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.

The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to the operations and financial condition reported in the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended June 30
 2013 and 2012 and should be read in conjunction with such financial statements and related notes included in this report.





Our company
 China Ginseng Holdings Inc.
 was incorporated on June 24
 2004 in the State of Nevada.&#160;&#160;The company conducts business through its four wholly owned subsidiaries located in Northeast China and one subsidiary in Hong Kong.&#160;We have been granted 20 year land use rights to&#160;3
705 acres of lands by the Chinese government for ginseng planting and lease Vineyard.

Since our inception in 2004
 we have been engaged in the business of farming
 processing
 distribution and marketing of fresh ginseng
 dry ginseng
 ginseng seeds
 and seedlings.&#160;&#160;In March 2008
 we acquired Tonghua Linyuan Grape Planting Co.
 to plant wild mountain grapes
 which we decided to cease in June 2012. Starting in August 2010
 we have gradually shifted the&#160;focus of our business from direct sales of ginseng to canned&#160;ginseng juice and wine.



Since we shifted the focus of our business into the ginseng beverage business
 and the wine business
 we have started to store our raw material and sell very limited self-produced ginseng. We also purchase ginseng from outside sources
 and then resell them to generate revenue and those sales are based on the order from the market. However
 due to the global recession and local market conditions
 demand for ginseng exports declined beginning in 2008
 creating a significant oversupply in China. All those factors caused us to have losses in recent years. In addition
 our new business is in the initial stages
 we need to spend capital to promote our new products
 and develop our marketing plan. There is no assurance that there will be sufficient demand for our beverages and wine to allow us to operate profitably initially
 or at all. Our auditors have determined that we do not currently have sufficient working capital necessary and have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As of June 30
 2013
 the cash balance on hand for the Company was about $19
454.


In order to meet the challenge
 we are taking the following actions:























Although we have not generated any revenues from our ginseng beverage and wine businesses
 we believe there is future potential to do so because (i) the China&#8217;s ginseng market is recovering now
 (ii) the demand and the price is in the uptrend due to Chinese government restrictions on the amount of land available for ginseng farming (land under our Company&#8217;s control was not affected by the government restrictions)
 and (iii)&#160;&#160;as of the date this filing
 we have already entered into binding agreements with ten&#160;&#160;distributors to distribute our&#160;&#160;beverage in different cities.
















As the impact of the shift in the focus of our business away from the ginseng business and into the ginseng beverage business and then the wine business is uncertain
 our past revenues and other financial results will not provide a meaningful basis for future performance given the material change in our business and there is no guarantee that we will be able to attain profitability in the foreseeable future.
































Tonghua Linyuan: growing grapes and reserving grape juices for wine production
 producing wine through a winery producer (Note: as explained in other parts of this filing
 we sold all assets and debts of Tonghua Linyuan on June 30
 2013
 pursuant to which Tonghua Linyuan became a shell and ceased operations.)





















As of the date of this filing
 except as explained above for Tonghua Linyuan
 each of our subsidiaries operates as an essential&#160;part of our integrated business and&#160;&#160;all of our businesses are operational.





Previously
 through 
 we focused on the farming
 processing
 distribution and marketing of Asian and American Ginseng and related byproducts in the following varieties:










 For pharmaceutical
 health supplement
 cosmetic industry and fresh consumption.













 &#160;&#160;Dried form for pharmaceutical and
 health supplement&#160;consumption.


































Ginseng's growing season is from April to September
 six months a year.&#160;&#160;Normally we sow the seed in April and harvest in September. Ginseng seeds are obtained after the blossom in autumn
 the seed can be sowed in September or next Spring
 it takes 10 days to germinate and 10 days for seedling.&#160;&#160;And the whole growing cycle for ginseng&#160;from seeding to harvest usually takes around 5-6 years to ensure the growth of ginseng and the nutrition it contains in the root. For ginseng
 every hectare can harvest 18 to 20 kg ginseng. As of June 30
 2013
 the planting area for ginseng is 287.984 square meter.


Since August 2010
 we have gradually shifted our business focus from direct sale of ginseng and ginseng byproducts to production and sale of canned ginseng juice and wine.


Through Jilin Ganzhi
 we are&#160;producing two types of canned ginseng juice.






























In addition to canned ginseng juice
 we have added wine production to our business focus.&#160;&#160; We started wine production through a winery producer&#160;in March 2011 and sales in April 2011. We have contracted for the production of the wine.





















































Currently
 there are about 10 kinds of ginseng drinks on the market; all of them are imported from Korea.&#160;&#160;The price range for those products is 4 &#8211;30 RMB per can (about USD $0.60-$ 4.51).

The most important component of ginseng is ginsenoside. Based upon reading competitor labels
 all of their ginseng drinks are produced by blending after extracting ginsenosides through chemical methods. The extraction for ginsenosides will cause damage to its nutritional components.&#160;Our technology is different from that traditional method used by our competitors.&#160;&#160;We squeeze out the natural juice from fresh ginseng as the main material plus natural extracts like xylitol
 citric acid and steviosides as subsidiary ingredients. We have farming technicians periodically inspect farmers to ensure they follow our growing guidelines to control the quality of the fresh ginseng.&#160;&#160;We use low residue pesticide and biodegradable fertilizer for ginseng planting. And we use xylitol instead of sugar to lower calories.&#160;&#160;Further
 products made with xylitol do not cause a sour taste.


The reason direct squeezing is not commonly used in canned ginseng juice is that it needs fresh ginseng as a raw material and preservation of fresh ginseng is very difficult. However
 our drink formula enables us to use refrigerated ginseng as raw material to produce canned ginseng juice and still able to preserve its freshness and nutrition in final products&#160;&#160;The drink formula for our ginseng beverages is a registered patent approved by the Chinese government
 patent number ZL 03111397.6.&#160;&#160;This patent was issued on January 23
 2008 and expires 20 years after issuance.


In order to produce canned ginseng juice
 we store our fresh ginseng in refrigerated warehouse space. We are currently renting a refrigerated warehouse (-20 C degree) to store all fresh ginseng inventory necessary for production of the ginseng beverages.&#160;&#160;&#160;Monthly rent for refrigerated warehouse is RMB 4
500 (about&#160;USD $676.86). We commenced production in August 2010 and sales in October 2010. However
 as we are in the initial stage of ginseng beverage business
 we cannot assure the demands for our ginseng beverage will be high enough to make our business profitable in the short term and there is no guarantee that we will be able to generate the revenue from ginseng beverage business.


We own the production plant.&#160;&#160;The plant is certified by the Chinese government as a Good Manufacturing Process facility
 which is required for our production of these products.&#160;&#160;Good Manufacturing Process standards cover organization and personnel
 building and facilities
 equipment
 materials
 hygiene and sanitation
 validation
 documentation
 production management
 quality management
 production distribution and recall
 complaints and adverse reactions report
 and self-inspections.





Our grapes grew on 750 acres of land leased from a group of individual farmers
 paying approximately $37.50 per acre a year for 15 years.&#160;&#160;However
 recent harvests of grapes showed poor quality for wine production which indicates that the vineyards are no longer suitable for planting grapes for wine production. Therefore
 we have decided not to renew our lease for the vineyards with the Chinese government upon expiration on December 31
 2013 and going forward we intend to purchase grapes from the open market in order to produce grape juice and wine.


We started producing wine in March 2011 and had one sale in April 2011. Through Tonghua Linyuan
 we have a written production agreement with Tonghua Jinyuanshan Winery (&#8220;Jinyuanshan Winery&#8221;) to produce wine for us from May 20
 2009 to May 19
 2017. After Tonghua Linyuan ceased operations pursuant to the sale of all of its assets on June 30
 2013
 the contracts entered into by Tonghua Linyuan with Jinyuanshan Winery remain valid and will be fulfilled by our subsidiary
 Jilin Huamei. Under the terms of the agreement
 we provide Jinyuanshan Winery with grape juice
 bottling supplies and packaging supplies
 and Jinyuanshan Winery produces and bottles the wine with a charge of approximately $0.15-0.22 per bottle (approximately $0.15&#160;a bottle for processing red wine and approximately $0.22 per bottle for processing ice wine).





We intend to recruit one general distributor for our products of ginseng beverage and wine in every city in China.&#160;&#160;The city level distributor can recruit the second level distributors.&#160;&#160;In addition to recruiting general distributors
 in some major cities
 Jilin Huamei will establish sale branch offices to facilitate the local sales. Our direct sale will target at customers of high end retailers such as supermarkets
 pharmacies
 hotels
 gift shops
 entertainment centers
 tourists attractions
 airport and high speed trains
 etc.

We have started negotiating distribution and sales agreements with potential general distributors. Currently
 we have signed 7 general distributors for our ginseng beverage and 1 general distributor for our wine.




The market for ginseng products&#160;and wine is highly competitive. Our operations may be affected by technological advances by competitors
 industry consolidation
 patents granted to competitors
 competitive combination products
 new products offered by our competitors
 as well as new information provided by other marketed products and/or other post-market studies.



















The following tables present certain consolidated statement of operations information. Financial information is presented for the year ended June 30
 2013 and 2012
 respectively.

Our total revenue decreased from $4
315
809 for the year ended June 30
 2012 to $3
563
165 for the year ended June 30
 2013
 a decrease of $752
644 or 17%. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease of the sales of purchased ginseng
 wine and ginseng beverage.


The sales revenue from our ginseng production includes our own farming production and ginseng purchased from the farmers who leased land from us
 collectively referred as our grown ginseng.&#160;&#160;For the year ended June 30
 2013
 the sales of our grown ginseng increased by $1
035
547 or 117%
 compared to the year ended June 30
 2012.&#160;&#160;The increase of sale s revenue was caused by significant increase of market price.


In August 2012
 the typhoon Bolaven&#160;landed at Mudanjiang Ginseng Farm causing a significant loss on our own ginseng production. As a result of the typhoon
 all of the ginseng at Mudanjiang that was to be harvested in the calendar years 2014 has been lost so that there will be no ginseng to be harvested until 2018. The ginseng we harvested in fiscal year 2012 was from Yanbian Huaxing and we sold it to the market because it was not qualified as raw material to make ginseng juice due to typhoon damage. The Typhoon also caused the market price for the year ended June 30
 2012 to increase by&#160;&#160;$28.32/kg.
















Although the damage caused by the typhoon will reduce the production of our grown ginseng leading&#160;&#160;our ginseng juice production to be more dependent on outside sources for raw material supplies
 &#160;we believe&#160;this damage should not have a significant impact on our ginseng beverage business due to the following reasons: 1) our current inventory for stored high quality fresh ginseng enables us to produce approximately one million cans of ginseng juice; 2) we only sold 5113 boxes (59
477 cans) and 13
972 boxes (159
281 cans) of ginseng juice during the years ended June 30
 2013 and 2012
 respectively.&#160;&#160;Although we anticipate that market demands for our ginseng juice will increase gradually
 we do not foresee it will exceed one million cans of ginseng during the year of 2014; 3) in the past
 high quality ginseng purchased from the outside farmers has been a major source of raw material supplies for our ginseng juice production and we will continue purchasing ginseng from outside sources for ginseng juice production based on our production needs; and 4) we maintain good relationships with ginseng farmers and are well known in local ginseng industry. We have not encountered any difficulty and do not expect&#160;any in purchasing high quality ginseng from outside sources.

On the other hand
 resale revenue of ginseng we purchased from the open market based on our major customers&#8217; orders decreased from $2
705
019 for the year ended June 30
 2012 to $1
247
108 for the year ended June 30
 2013
 a decrease of $1
457
911 or 54%. The decrease was mainly caused by the decreased quantity we sold to the major customers and decreased average resale price. The quantity we sold to our major customers decreased by 31
261kg
 or 49% during the year ended June 30
 2013
 compared to the year ended June 30
 2012. The decrease was mainly because two of our major customers
 Heilong Jiang Sinopharm Medicine Co
 Ltd and Yasukuni Sinlong Chinese Herbal Medicine Company
 temporarily stopped their orders because of their own production issue.&#160;In addition
 the average resale price of the purchased ginseng decreased by $5/Kg
 or 12% during the year ended June 30
 2013
 compared to the year ended June 30
 2012. This decrease was due to decreased quality of ginseng we purchased in 2013 compared to 2012








90% of $1
457
911 or $1
312
129 decrease was caused by decreased quantity of sale











10% of $1
457
911 or $145
791 decrease was caused by the decrease of resale price of purchased ginseng




For the year ended June 30
 2013
 approximately $71
263 or 2 % of our revenue was generated from our ginseng beverage production
 a decrease of $345
381 or 83%
 compared to the year ended June 30
 2012. The decrease was due to decreased quantity and sale price. Because of the limited cash we had in 2013
 we were not able to conduct marketing for our ginseng beverage. Although we discounted our sale price
 we sold less ginseng beverage compared to the year ended June 30
 2012. Thus
 in order to improve the sale of ginseng beverages
 we plan to 1) adjust our marketing strategy of ginseng beverages by applying a new reduced size ginseng beverage in the fiscal year 2014; 2) enhance Hong Kong Huaxia sales force through training classes and/or hiring more experienced sales person; 3) adjust our online shopping platform to make it easier to access
 and more convenient for customers; and 4) raise capital from third parties to fund the above-mentioned strategies.

We believe that we will be able to improve the sale of ginseng beverages through the above changes and expect that sales of ginseng beverage will rise to 70% of our revenue in the next five years. However
 there is no assurance that our sales of ginseng beverage will meet our expectation as the market conditions may change.

For the year ended June 30
 2013
 approximately $2
618 of our revenue was generated from wine product
 a decrease of $230
061
 compared to the year ended June 30
 2012. The decrease was mainly caused by the decreased demands from the customers. Based on the current trend of wine demands in China market
 the Company adjusted the anticipation of its wine revenue in the next 3 to 5 years from 20% to 5%. And there can be no assurance that our sales of wine will reach such levels in the anticipated time period
 if at all.


The remaining $318
067 or 9% of our revenue for the year ended June 30
 2013 was generated from resale of Aoweisi cosmetic products
 which were sold&#160;through Hong Kong Huaxia based on consumers&#8217; orders. We do not expect this to be a major source of our revenue in the future.

Our total cost of goods sold decreased from $3
313
553 for the year ended June 30
 2012 to $2
671
572 for the year ended June 30
 2013
 a decrease of $641
981 or 19.37%.&#160;&#160;


1. The total cost of ginseng production increased from $635
871 for the year ended June 30
 2012 to $1
427
154 for the year ended June 30
 2013
 an increase of $791
283 or 124.44%. The increase was mainly caused by the fact that we harvested less ginseng in the fiscal year ended June 30
 2013 due to the damages on our farm lands from a typhoon in August 2012. Therefore
 the total fix cost of our growing ginseng crops
&#160;such as annual maintenance
 fertilizer
 pesticides
 plant sheds
 irrigation
 transportation
 etc 
 allocated on harvest ginseng increased in the year ended June 30
 2013.



2. The cost of resale of purchased ginseng decreased from $2
407
959 for the year ended June 30
 2012 to $1
126
869 for the year ended June 30
 2013. The decrease was primarily because of decreased quantity of ginseng we purchased from outside farmers.&#160;The decreased purchase quantity was due to reduced market demands. Additionally
 during this same period there were two major customers that temporarily stopped their orders.



3. Our cost of ginseng beverage production decreased from $216
375 for the year ended June 30
 2012 to $71
598 for the year ended June 30
 2013
 a decrease of $144
777
 or 66.91%
&#160;&#160;primarily due to decreased variable cost
 such as part-time labor cost
 raw material cost and maintenance fees
 etc.


4. Our cost of wine production decreased from $31
479 for the year ended June 30
 2012 to $1
336 for the year ended June 30
 2013. The decrease was mainly because of the significant decrease in the quantity of wine we sold during the year ended June 30
 2013.&#160;&#160;


We had a new cost of $44
615 from sales of Aoweisi cosmetic products for the year ended June 30
 2013
 which did not occur during the year ended June 30
 2012.

Cost of Sales as a percentage of revenue decreased by 2% in the year ended June 30
 2013 as compared to the year ended June 30
 2012. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease of cost of goods sold attributable to purchased ginseng and beverage production as compared to the fiscal year of&#160;2012.





Gross profit was approximately $891
593 for the year ended June 30
 2013 compared to $1
002
256 for the year ended June 30
 2012
 a decrease of $110
663 or 11%. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in our overall product sales.




Selling
 general and administrative expenses decreased from $1
894
721 for the year ended June 30
 2012 to $1
330
146 for the year ended June 30
 2013
 a decrease of $564
575
 or 30%. The decrease in 2013 was due to the decrease in our operation expense from Ganzhi including but not limited to meal allowance
 labor cost and marketing expense
 such as advertising expense
 etc from HK Huaxia and Jilin Huamei.

Our selling
 general and administrative expenses may fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors
 including
 but not limited to:










Additional expenses as a result of becoming a reporting company including
 but not limited to SEC reporting
 transfer agent fees
 additional staffing
 professional fees and similar expenses;













Expenses resulting from developing new products or expansion of new markets
 including travel and entertainment and advertising expenses.























The allowance for doubtful accounts represents management&#8217;s estimate of the amount of probable credit losses
 determined by reviewing past due balances and other information.&#160;&#160;The bad debt expense increased by $248
197
or 42% from $594
749 for the year ended June 30
 2012 to $842
946 for the year ended June 30
 2013.The increase in bad debt expense in 2013 was due to the determination that certain past due receivables from 2012 were uncollectible.&#160;&#160;





Depreciation and amortization was $82
240 for the year ended June 30
 2013
 compared to $49
635 for the year ended June 30
 2012
 an increase of $32
605 or 66%.&#160;&#160;The increase was primarily&#160;due to a full year&#8217;s depreciation on new building purchases
 and less depreciation being capitalized.




Our interest expense increased by $42
448
 from $294
238 for the year ended June 30
 2012 to $251
790 for the year ended June 30
 2013
 representing a 14% decrease.&#160;&#160;Interest expense includes an amount for imputed interest relating to non-interest bearing loans to related parties aggregating&#160;$124
931 and $156
599 for the years ended June 30
 2013 and 2012
 respectively. The interest unpaid to bank loans for the Jilin Ganzhi building was the primary reasons for the decrease in interest expense occurred in the year ended June 30
 2013.&#160;




There is no income tax expense for the year ended June 30
 2013.





In August 2012
 a typhoon struck the Mudanjiang Ginseng Farm destroying approximately 112
000 square meters of planted ginseng having an approximate value of $1
227
979. This loss was charged to operations during the year ended June 30
 2013.





As a result of the above factors
 net loss was $3
646
004 for the year ended June 30
 2013
 an increase of $720
520 or 25%
 as compared to the net loss of $2
925

We operate primarily in the PRC and the functional currency of our operating subsidiary is the Chinese Renminbi (&#8220;RMB&#8221;).&#160;&#160;The RMB is not freely convertible into foreign currency and all foreign exchange transactions must take place through authorized institutions.&#160;&#160;No representation is intended to imply that the Renminbi amounts could have been
 or could be
 converted
 realized or settled into USD at the rate on June 30
 2013 or at any other rate.


The value of RMB against U.S. dollar may fluctuate and is affected by changes in political and economic conditions. Our revenues
 costs and financial assets are mostly dominated in RMB while our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly
 this may result in gains or losses from currency translation on our financial statements.


Translation adjustments resulting from this process amounted to $169
400 and&#160;$152
897 for the year ended June 30
 2013 and 2012
 respectively.&#160;And we have comprehensive loss of $3
815
404 and $2
772
587 for the year ended June 30
 2013 and 2012
 respectively. &#160;The assets&#160;and liabilities&#160;amounts with the exception of equity&#160;for the year ended June 30
 2013 were translated at 6.1787&#160;RMB to 1.00 USD as compared to 6.3249 RMB to 1.00 USD for the year ended June 30
 2012. The equity accounts were stated at their historical rate. The average translation rates applied to the income statements accounts for the year ended June 30
 2013 and 2012 were 6.27968 RMB&#160;and 6.3437 RMB
 respectively.





Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations
 satisfy its obligations and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. We have historically financed our operation and capital expenditures through loans from related parties
 including officers
 directors and other shareholders of the Company and have raised capital through a Regulation S private placement as well. Our current activities are related to developing our new business strategy the sale of&#160;Ginseng juice and wine products.



As of June 30
 2013
 we had working capital deficit of $1
223
760
 compared to a working capital deficit of $1
077
872 as of June 30
 2012.

















As of June 30
 2013
 there was no change in our loan payments compared with June 30
 2012 since the loans remained constant. As of June 30
 2013
 we had an outstanding loan of 2
000
000 RMB (about $316
211) to Ji&#8217;An Qingshi Credit Cooperatives (&#8220;Ji&#8217;An Qingshi&#8221;). The principal terms of the loan are as follows:




































Loan Amount: Principal of 2
000
000 RMB (about USD $316
211) with an annual interest of 6.325%













Loan Period:&#160;&#160;From February 4
 2002 to February 4
 2003; Repayment due date was February 4
 2003



















We have not paid any principal or interest of the loan; however
 Ji&#8217;An Qingshi verbally agreed in March 2008&#160;not to call the loan. The material terms for the verbal agreement are: No principal or interest payments are required to be made until the Company is generating profits and&#160;interest continues to accrue until we repay the loan.&#160;&#160;&#160;On June 27
 2013
 the Company decided to dispose of the assets and liabilities of Tonghua Linyuan to a third party and plans to close Tonghua Linyuan. The Company has retained $508
347 in contingent liabilities of Tonghua Linyuan for the year ended June 30
 2013.


On August 30
&#160;&#160;2012
 we refinanced the 8 million RMB bank loan which we obtained from Meihekou City Rural Credit Union on November 8
 2010 by a new loan of 8 million RMB (approximately USD $1
264
842) from the same lender.&#160;&#160;The principal terms of the new 8 million RMB bank loan agreements are as follows:









Parties: Jilin Ganzhi Ginseng Products Co.
 Ltd (&#8220;Jilin Ganzhi&#8221;) and Meihekou City Rural Credit Union (&#8220;Meihekou Credit Union&#8221;);








Meihekou Credit Union granted a loan of 8 million RMB (approximately USD $ 1
264
842 ) to Jilin Ganzhi to be used in calling in and refunding and the term of the loan is 24 months from August 30
 2012 to August 29
 2014.








The loan carries a benchmark interest rate is the rate announced by the People&#8217;s Bank of China as an interest rate of same type and class of loans at the date of the loan and&#160;changes with the adjustment of national bank rate.&#160;&#160;Meihekou Credit Union calculates the interest on a monthly basis applying this annual floating rate which is payable on the 21st day of each month. We paid interest of 94
127 RMB (about USD $ 14
838) on August 21
 2012. And from September
 2012 to June 30
 2013
 we have not paid interest and we plan to pay all outstanding interest when we have sufficient cash.








Repay the principal by installments according to the following repayment plan: principal payment of RMB1M (approximately USD $159
096) on September 20
 2012
 RMB 1M (approximately USD $159
096) on August 29
 2013
 RMB 1M (approximately USD $159
096) on December 20
 2013 and RMB 5M (approximately USD $795
481) on August 29
 2014.&#160;&#160;The payment due in September 2012 was not made by the Company and the note is thus in default.




As of June 30
 2013
 there was no change in our loan payments compared to June 30
 2012
 since the loans remained constant.&#160;&#160;Since the lender
 Ji&#8217;An Qingshi Credit Cooperative has verbally agreed not to call the loan
 we can repay this loan at our own discretion when funds are available. Thus
 the debt in Tonghua Linyuan acquisition will not have impact on our liquidity and capital resource before we start to repay the lender.



As of June 30
 2013 and 2012
 we had notes payable of approximately $1
279
982and $1
271
740 to related parties
 respectively. These amounts are mainly due to the working capital demands of the business. Most of these related parties&#160;are our individual shareholders or immediate family members of our&#160;shareholders and friends of our shareholders.&#160;&#160;The individuals loaned us funds
 which are interest free
 which have no specific repayment date&#160;and are unsecured.&#160;&#160;The funds received are evidenced by receipt of cash acknowledgments.&#160;&#160;


As of June 30
 2013
. We plan to fund operations and capital expenditures with cash from operations
 as well as loans from major shareholders and management members and their affiliates.&#160;We might also pursue additional financings in the form of debt
 equity or convertible security offerings. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such additional financing at acceptable terms to us
 or at all




















Cash flows results for the fiscal years ended June 30
 2013 and 2012 are summarized as following:

Cash flows provided by&#160;&#160;operating activities is&#160;&#160;$108
478 for the year ended June 30
 2013
 compared to the cash flows of $1
051
182&#160;&#160;used in operating activities for the year ended June 30
 2012. This change was because we had the amount of $85
123 net cash used in operating activities- continuing operations and the amount of $193
 601 net cash&#160;provided by&#160;operating activities- discontinued operations for the year ended June 30
 2013.



Cash flows used in operating activities- continuing operations decreased by $85
123 in the year ended June 30
 2013 compared with 2012. This change was primarily due to a combination of a net loss of $2
843
508
 increased accounts receivable of $1
929
103 mainly offset by increased account payable of $662
823
 increase in amount due to farmers of $307
449
 a decrease in ginseng crops of $644
646
&#160;and a&#160;decrease in amounts due from farmers of $196
332.





The decrease in our ginseng crops&#160;was due to damange caused by typhoon in August
 2012. In August 2012
 a typhoon struck the Mudanjiang Ginseng farm destroying approximately 111
839 square meters of planted ginseng having an approximate value of RMB 6
754
675 (US$ 1
227
979)
 which was charged as an impairment loss in the Statement of Operations.&#160;&#160;The decrease in accounts due from farmers was because the Company extended the credit term to them to obtain a good relationship with the suppliers.


On June 30
 2013
 the Company discontinued its' grape production operations.&#160;&#160;The Company sold the assets and liabilities of Tonghua Linyuan
 and plans to close Tonghua Linyuan.



Cash flows provided by investing activities amounted to $13
497&#160;for the year ended June 30
 2013
 which consisted of a purchase of office equipment of $2
689 and return of investment in unconsolidated businesses of $16
186.&#160;&#160;&#160;In July 2012
 the Company purchased a cell phone for sales department;&#160; in April 2013
 the Company purchased a computer for Hong Kong Huaxia; and in January 2013
 the Company withdrew the investment made on September 25
 2011 because Jilin Province Jiliang Beverage Investment Co
 Ltd could not provide register fund into the Company.


Cash flows used in investing activities amounted to $32
338 for the year ended June 30
 2012
 which consisted of a long-term investment of $16
358 and a purchase of property and equipment of $15
980.&#160;&#160;During the year ended June 30
 2012
Yanbian Huaxing spent $3
775 (24
500 RMB) to purchase a tractor for ginseng farming business and Jilin Huamei spent $12
205 (77
425) RMB)&#160;purchasing office supplies
 such as computers
 printers
 office tables
 desks
 bookcases
 chairs and sofa.


In September 2011
 the Company entered into agreement with three other companies to establish a new entity
 Jilin Province Jiliang Beverage Investment Management Co.
 Ltd (&#8220;Jilin Jiliang&#8221;). The purpose of Jilin Jiliang is to provide investment and project consultation. Under the agreement
 the Company is required to invest a total of $78
679 (RMB 500
000) for a 10% interest in Jilin Jiliang by September 25
 2012. In September 2011
 the Company invested $15
887 (RMB 100
000) in Jilin Jiliang. The Company accounts for this investment utilizing the cost method.





Our cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended June 30
 2013 was $17
545
 from loans payable to related parties.&#160;

Cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended June 30
 2012 was $886
417 which consists of proceeds from sale of common stock of 49
940 and proceeds from loans payable to the related parties of $836
447.

Cash flows provided by financing activities decreased by $871
872 or 98% for the year ended June 30
 2013 compared to June 30
 2012




As indicated in the accompanying financial statements for the year ended June 30
 2013
 the Company had an accumulated deficit of $9
407
413
 at June 30
 2013
 a negative working capital deficit of $1
223
760 at June 30
 2013 and there are existing uncertain conditions the Company foresees relating to its ability to obtain working capital and operate successfully.&#160;Management&#8217;s plans include the raising of capital through the equity markets to fund future operations and the generating of revenue through its businesses. Failure to raise adequate capital and generate adequate sales revenues could result in the Company having to curtail or cease operations.
















Additionally
 even if the Company does raise sufficient capital to support its operating expenses and generate adequate revenues
 there can be no assurances that the revenues will be sufficient to enable it to develop business to a level where it will generate profits and cash flows from operations.&#160;&#160;These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern.&#160;&#160;However
 the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis
 which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.&#160;&#160;These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

 2013 AND 2012




NOTE A &#8211; NATURE OF BUSINESS
 PRESENTATION AND GOING CONCERN





China Ginseng Holdings
 Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;)
 was incorporated under the laws of Nevada on June 24
 2004.


On November 24
 2004
 the Company acquired 55% of Yanbian Huaxing Ginseng Industry Co. Limited (&#8220;Yanbian Huaxing&#8221;)
 which is located in China and
 is in the business of farming
 processing
 distribution
 and marketing of Asian Ginseng.&#160;&#160;The company utilizes the Ginseng harvest to produce a Ginseng beverage and buys Ginseng for the resale market.&#160;&#160;On November 24
 2005
 the Company acquired the remaining 45% of Yanbian Huaxing.


Yanbian Huaxing controls
 through 20 year leases granted by the Chinese Government
 approximately 1
500 hectors (3
705 acres) of land used to grow ginseng.&#160;&#160;The Company had no operations prior to November 24
 2004. These leases expire through 2024.


On August 24
 2005
 the Company acquired Jilin Ganzhi Ginseng Produce Co. Limited
 whose principal business is the manufacture of Ginseng drinks.


On October 19
 2005
 the Company incorporated a new company
 Jilin Huamei Beverage Co. Limited (&#8220;Jilin Huamei&#8221;).


On March 31
 2008 the Company acquired Tonghua Linyuan Grape Planting Co. Limited (&#8220;Tonghua Linyuan&#8221;) whose principal activity was the growing
 cultivation and harvesting of a grape vineyard. The Company plans to produce wine and grape juice but to date has not commenced production. As of June 30
 2012
 Tonghua Linyuan leased 750 acres of land on which the grapes were planted.&#160;&#160;In June 2012
 the Company decided to abandon the growing and harvesting of grapes due to the poor quality of recent harvests which were not suitable for the production of wine or grape juice. Accordingly
 the Company has abandoned the vineyard and recorded a charge to operations of $872
658. The Company has also decided not to renew its leases with the Chinese Government.&#160;&#160;The Company will now purchase grapes in the open market to produce wine and grape juice.&#160;&#160;On June 30
 2013
 the Company sold the assets and liabilities of Tonghua Linyuan to a third party. See Note O.


On March 2
 2012
 the Company approved the incorporation of a new subsidiary
 Hong Kong Huaxia International Industrial Co.
 Limited (&#8220;Hong Kong Huaxia&#8221;) in Hong Kong in order to sell health and specialized local products.&#160;&#160;Hong Kong Huaxia was incorporated in Hong Kong on March 18
 2012 and began operations in April 2012.&#160;&#160;Hong Kong Huaxia has registered 880
000
000 shares of 1 HKD par value stock in Hong Kong.&#160;&#160;None of the $113
443
000 (880

The financial statements include the accounts and activities of China Ginseng Holdings
 Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
 Yanbian Huaxing Ginseng Co. Limited
 Jilin Huamei Beverage Co. Limited
 Jilin Ganzhi Ginseng Products Co. Limited
 Tonghua Linyuan Grape Planting Co. Limited and Hong Kong Huaxia International Industrial

FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30
 2013 AND 2012

NOTE A &#8211; NATURE OF BUSINESS
 PRESENTATION AND GOING CONCERN (CONTINUED)





As indicated in the accompanying financial statements
 the Company had an accumulated deficit of $9
407
413
 at June 30
 2013
 a negative working capital deficit of $1
223
760 at June 30
 2013 and there are existing uncertain conditions the Company foresees relating to its ability to obtain working capital and operate successfully. See also Note S as to losses from typhoon which occurred in August of 2012.&#160;&#160;Management&#8217;s plans include the raising of capital through the equity markets to fund future operations and the generating of revenue through its businesses. Failure to raise adequate capital and generate adequate sales revenues could result in the Company having to curtail or cease operations.


Additionally
 even if the Company does raise sufficient capital to support its operating expenses and generate adequate revenues
 there can be no assurances that the revenues will be sufficient to enable it to develop business to a level where it will generate profits and cash flows from operations.&#160;&#160;These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern.&#160;&#160;However
 the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis
 which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.&#160;&#160;These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.















The Company considers the Chinese Renminbi to be its functional currency.&#160;&#160; Assets and liabilities were translated into US dollars at period-end exchange rates.&#160;&#160;Statement of operations amounts were translated using the average rate during the period.&#160;&#160;Gains and losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income
 a separate component of stockholders&#8217; equity.





For purposes of reporting cash flows
 cash equivalents include investment instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.&#160;&#160;There were no cash equivalents at June 30
 2013 and 2012.





Inventory consists of fresh and dried Ginseng
 as well as formerly crushed grapes
 and is stated at the lower of cost or market value.&#160;&#160;Cost is determined using the First-In
 First-Out (FIFO) Method.


















CHINA GINSENG HOLDINGS
 INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES



FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30
 2013 AND 2012








The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. For the year ended June 30
 2013 and 2012
 advertising expenses were $1
035 and $17
735
 respectively.





The Company uses the full absorption costing method to value its Ginseng crops.&#160;&#160;Included in crop costs are seeds
 labor
 applicable overhead including depreciation
 and supplies. Common costs are allocated in each period based upon the total number of hectors under cultivation during the period.


The carrying value of the Ginseng crops is reviewed on a regular basis for any impairment in value using management&#8217;s best estimate as to expected future market values
 yields and costs to harvest.&#160;&#160;Costs accumulated on the acres expected to be harvested during the next fiscal year have been classified as a current asset.





The Company processes Ginseng and stores the stock for its Ginseng juice production.&#160;&#160;Any grown Ginseng not suitable for the beverage production is sold.&#160;&#160;The Company is also purchasing Ginseng for its resale business. Ginseng is planted in the Spring (March) and Fall (September) of each year and is generally harvested in September. It usually takes 6 years for a Ginseng root to mature
 although
 senior maturity can be 8 years.





When the Company sells Ginseng
 it receives orders prior to harvest.&#160;&#160;For major customers
 approximately 20% to 30% is paid upon delivery as payment in advance.&#160;&#160;The balance is billed after the customer incurs a lengthy inspection process which can take up to 60 days.&#160;&#160;Until the customer finalizes its inspection and deems the shipment acceptable
 the shipment is still the property of the Company.&#160;&#160;Upon customer completion of inspection and approval
 the sale is then recognized and the balance of the invoice price is wired to the Company. For smaller sales
 customers pick up the Ginseng from the Company
 pay in cash at time of pick up and receive an invoice with appropriate sales tax applied and a cash acknowledgement. On these orders
 revenue is recognized upon shipment/payment.


The Company has entered into several distribution agreements to sell Ginseng juice and wine.&#160;&#160;In accordance with these agreements
 the distributors will advance funds to the Company for orders to be placed.&#160;&#160;Upon the placement of orders by the distributor
 the Company will ship the product to the distributor and title will pass to the distributor.&#160;&#160;In relation to distribution agreements for Ginseng beverages
 it is the Company&#8217;s policy
 commencing with the initiation of the distribution agreements
 to allow the distributors to return all unsold products at the end of six months from the shipment date should the product not be sold and the product has not exceeded the expiration date.&#160;&#160;The Company is establishing history as to the quantity of the Ginseng which has been returned in order to determine if a reserve for returns and allowances is necessary.&#160;&#160;To date
 returns have been minimal.





















CHINA GINSENG HOLDINGS
 INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES



FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30
 2013 AND 2012







For each reporting period
 the Company&#160;ascertains from each distributor its&#8217; current on hand quantity and assesses the situation in order to establish a return allowance
 if necessary.&#160;&#160;At June 30
 2013
 no inventory was held on consignment.





Accounts receivable consist principally of trade receivables. When Ginseng is shipped to a customer
 the customer is entitled to an inspection process which could take up to 60 days.&#160;&#160;Upon completion of the inspection and approval process
 the customer notifies the company and a sale is recorded.&#160;&#160;The allowance for doubtful accounts represents management&#8217;s estimate of the amount of probable credit losses
 determined by reviewing past due balances and other information.&#160;&#160;Account balances are written off against the allowance if management determines the receivable is uncollectible.&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s standard terms stipulate payment in 60 days.&#160;&#160;The Company considers a receivable to be uncollectible after one year.&#160;&#160;The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1
507
992 and $664
976 at June 30
 2013 and June 30
 2012
 respectively.





Property and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets
 as follows:




































Routine maintenance
 repairs and replacement costs are expensed as incurred and improvements that extend the useful life of the assets are capitalized.&#160;&#160;When equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of
 the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in operations.



















CHINA GINSENG HOLDINGS
 INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES



FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30
 2013 AND 2012







In June 2012
 the Company decided to abandon the growing and harvesting of grapes due to the poor quality of recent harvests which were not suitable for the production of wine or grape juice. Accordingly
 the Company has abandoned the vineyard and recorded a charge to operations of $872
568
 which is included under discontinued operations. The Company has also decided not to renew its leases with the Chinese Government.&#160;&#160;The Company will now purchase grapes in the open market to produce wine and grape juice.











The Company follows ASC 220-10







The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.





The Company accounts for income taxes utilizing the liability method of accounting.&#160;&#160;Under the liability method
 deferred taxes are determined based on differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates in effect in years in which differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established
 when necessary
 to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are expected to be ultimately realized.

FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30
 2013 AND 2012







 (&#8220;ASC 740-10&#8221;).&#160;&#160;This interpretation requires recognition and measurement of uncertain income tax positions using a &#8220;more-likely-than-not&#8221; approach.&#160;&#160;Management evaluates their tax positions on an annual basis
 and has determined that as of June 30
 2012 and 2013
 no additional accrual for income taxes other than the foreign
 federal and state provisions and related interest and estimated penalty accruals are considered necessary.





Long-lived assets
 primarily property and equipment
 are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset
 a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used
 or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable.&#160;&#160;For long-lived assets to be held and used
 the Company recognizes an impairment loss only if its carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted cash flows and measures the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value.




 defines fair value
 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles
 and expands disclosure about fair value measurements.&#160;&#160;ASC issued 825-10







Certain reclassifications have been made to consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30
 2012 to make them comparable to the presentation for the year ended June 30
 2013.





In June 2012
 the FASB issued an accounting standard update to provide guidance on increasing the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. This accounting standard update eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity and requires that the total of comprehensive income
 the components of net income
 and the components of other comprehensive income be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. It is also required to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement(s) where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented. The Company adopted this accounting standard effective July 1
 2011.

At June 30
 2013 and 2012 there were no shipments of Ginseng at customer locations awaiting inspection and approval that would be subject to invoicing.


In March of 2013
 the Company determined that the grape juice inventory held at Tonghua is no longer saleable.&#160;&#160;As such
 the Company&#160;&#160;wrote off inventory with a value of 8
855
286 RMB (US$ 1
410
149) at June 30
 2013.&#160;&#160;Such amount is included within Discontinued Operations on the Statement of Operations.





In December 2010
 the Company invested $24
762 (RMB 153
000) in Changchun Zhongshen Beverage Co. Ltd. (&#8220;Zhongshen&#8221;). This investment represented a 17% interest in Zhonghsen. Zhongshen is a retailer of ginseng juice and wine. The Company accounts for this investment utilizing the cost method.


In September 2011
 the Company entered into an agreement with three other companies to establish a new entity
 Jilin Province Jiliang Beverage Investment Management Co.
 Ltd (&#8220;Jilin Jiliang&#8221;). The purpose of Jilin Jiliang is to provide investment and project consultation. Under the agreement
 the Company was required to invest a total of $89
923 (RMB 500
000) for a 10% interest in Jilin Jiliang by September 25
 2012.&#160;&#160;In September 2011
 the Company invested $16
185 (RMB 100
000) in Jilin Jiliang. During the year ended June 30
 2013
 Jilin Jiliang returned the $16
185 (RMB 100
000) investment to the Company





The Company&#8217;s business
 prior to June 30
 2009
 was primarily to harvest and sell fresh and dried Ginseng.&#160;&#160;The growth period takes approximately 5 to 6 years before harvest can commence and up to 8 years for improved harvest and seedling yields. The Company is changing its business model to utilize the harvested Ginseng to manufacture Ginseng juice and other Ginseng beverages.&#160;&#160;It commenced the juice operation in August 2011.&#160;&#160;The Company plants selected areas each year and tracks the costs expended each year by planting area.&#160;&#160;The Chinese government owns all the land in China.


Currently
 the Company has land grants from the Chinese government for approximately 1
500 hectors of land (approximately 3
705 acres) to grow Ginseng which were awarded in April and May 2005. These grants are for 20 years and the management of the Company believes that the grants will be renewed as the grants expire in different areas.&#160;&#160;However
 there are no assurances that the Chinese government will continue to renew these grants in the future. The planting of new Ginseng is dependent upon the Company&#8217;s cash flow and its ability to raise working capital.

 2013 AND 2012





The Company has planted approximately 287
984 square meters of land. The Company plans to plant
 over the next 5 years
 100
000 square meters
 representing approximately 20
000 square meters per year. In the succeeding five years
 the Company plans to harvest approximately 60
945 square meters of Ginseng.&#160;&#160;The harvest plan by year is as follows: 2014-58
281 and 2017-2
664.&#160;&#160;


In August 2012
 a typhoon struck the Mudanjiang Ginseng farm destroying approximately 111
839 square meters of planted ginseng having an approximate value of RMB 6
754
675 (US$ 1
075

The cost of harvest is calculated by reference to the planting area and the detailed costs maintained for each planting area.&#160;&#160;Based upon the square meters planted by area
 a square meter cost is calculated and applied to the square meters harvested
 rendering a cost of harvest.


For each financial reporting period
 the Ginseng crop harvested is valued at net realizable value.&#160;&#160;If the net realizable value is lower than carrying value
 an impairment charge is made for the difference.

The Company has executed agreements with a number of local farmers to grow
 cultivate and harvest Ginseng utilizing the Company&#8217;s land grants.&#160;&#160;The farming contracts commenced in January 2008.&#160;&#160;In connection with these agreements
 the Company (1) leases sections of the Ginseng land grants to the farmers at approximately $1.50 (10 RMB) per square meter per year
 (2) provides the seeds and fertilizer to the farmers and clears the land of large debris.&#160;&#160;These costs are capitalized by the Company and included in the Ginseng Crop inventory
 (3) pays the farmers a management fee of approximately $0.50 (4.00 RMB) per square meter per year and (4) the farmers are required to produce 2kg of Ginseng for each square meter that they manage.&#160;&#160;The Company pays the farmers market price for their Ginseng.&#160;&#160;If the harvest is below 2kg per square meter
 the difference will be deducted from the total payment for Ginseng purchased.&#160;&#160;If the harvest produces more that 2kg per square meter
 the Company pays approximately $3.00 for every extra kilo. The Company records these agreements on a net basis by individual farmers.&#160;&#160;The Company has recorded a receivable from the farmers for the rental income of the leased Ginseng land grants of $0 and $191
794 at June 30
 2013 and 2012
 respectively.&#160;&#160;The Company has also recorded a long-term payable-farmers for the management fee due to the farmers.&#160;&#160;The liability at June 30
 2013 and 2012 was $870
300 and $549
841
 respectively.&#160;&#160;The receivable and liability balances for the respective areas will be settled at harvest time when the Company purchases the harvest at the current market value for Ginseng.

We have not changed
 nor had any disagreements with our accountants regarding our accounting or financial disclosure in the last two fiscal years.
















The Company&#8217;s management
 with the participation of the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;) and the Chief Financial Officer (&#8220;CFO&#8221;)
 evaluated the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation
 the CEO and CFO concluded that
 as of the end of such period
 the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective to ensure that information that is required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company&#8217;s management
 including the CEO and CFO
 as appropriate
 to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.













We do not expect that our controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Controls and procedures
 no matter how well conceived and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance that the objectives of the controls and procedures are met. Further
 the design of controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
 and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all controls and procedures
 no evaluation of controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud
 if any. The design of controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
 and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.


Management is responsible for establishing and managing adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Because of inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


Furthermore
 smaller reporting companies face additional limitations. Smaller reporting companies employ fewer individuals and may find it difficult to properly segregate duties. Often
 one or two individuals control every aspect of the Company&#8217;s operations and are in a position to override any system of internal control. Additionally
 smaller reporting companies tend to utilize general accounting software packages that lack a rigorous set of software controls.

Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30
 2013. In making this assessment
 management used the criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The objective of this assessment is to determine whether our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30
 2012. Based on our assessment utilizing the criteria issued by COSO
 management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30
 2013 due to the existence of the following material weaknesses:












As of June 30
 2013
 there was a lack of accounting personnel with the requisite knowledge of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) in the U.S. and financial reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission;















As of June 30
 2013
 there were insufficient written polities and procedures to ensure the correct application of accounting and financial reporting with respect to the current requirements of GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements.















As of June 30
 2013
 there was a lack of segregation of duties
 in that we only had one person performing all accounting related duties;















As of June 30
 2013
 there was no independent audit committee.




Notwithstanding the existence of these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting
 our management believes that the financial statements included in its reports fairly present in all material respects the Company&#8217;s financial condition
 results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.&#160;&#160;We continue to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls and procedures on an on-going basis. Once our cash flows from operations improve to a level where we are able to hire additional personnel in financial reporting
 we plan to improve our internal controls and procedures by hiring an experienced controller and building an internal accounting team with sufficient in-house expertise in US GAAP reporting.&#160;However
 due to the limited cash flow we are currently having
 we can not assure you when we will be able to implement those remediation methods.














There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules&#160;13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter covered by this report that has materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.






























The following table and text set forth the names and ages of all directors and executive officers as of June&#160;30
 2013. The board of directors elects our executive officers annually.&#160;&#160;A majority vote of the directors who are in office is required to fill vacancies.&#160;&#160;Each director shall be elected for the term of one year
 and until his successor is elected and qualified
 or until his earlier resignation or removal.

No officer
 director
 or persons nominated for such positions
 promoter or significant employee has been involved in the last ten years in any proceeding set forth in Item 401 of Regulation S-K.&#160;&#160;&#160;




Our Board of Directors has five directors and has not established Audit
 Compensation
 and Nominating or Governance Committees as standing committees. The Board does not have an executive committee or any committees performing a similar function. We are not currently listed on a national securities exchange or in an inter-dealer quotation system that has requirements that a majority of the board of directors be independent. The Board has determined that the two members of the Board are independent.


Due to our lack of operations and size prior to the Share Exchange
 we did not have an Audit Committee. Furthermore
 we are currently quoted on the Pink Sheets under the symbol &#8220;CSNG&#8221; and the Pink Sheets does not have any listing requirements mandating the establishment of any particular committees.&#160;&#160;For these same reasons
 we did not have any other separate committees during the fiscal year ended June 30
 2013; all functions of a nominating committee
 audit committee and compensation committee were performed by our whole board of directors.&#160;&#160;Our board of directors intends to appoint such persons and form such committees as are required to meet the corporate governance requirements imposed by the national securities exchanges as necessary. Therefore
 we intend that a majority of our directors will eventually be independent directors and at least one director will qualify as an &#8220;audit committee financial expert.&#8221;









The Board of Directors utilizes a leadership structure that has the Chief Executive Officer (who is the Corporation&#8217;s principal executive officer and a director) who also acts in the capacity as Board Chairman
 without a designated independent lead director. This structure creates efficiency in the preparation of the meeting agendas and related Board materials as the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer works more directly with those preparing the necessary board materials and is more connected to the overall daily operations of the Company. Agendas are also prepared with the permitted input of the full Board of Directors allowing for any concerns or risks of any individual director to be discussed as deemed appropriate. The Board believes that the Company has benefited from this structure and
 Mr. Liu&#8217;s continuation in the combined role of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is in the best interests of the shareholders.


The Company believes that this structure is appropriate and allows for efficient and effective oversight
 given the Company&#8217;s relatively small size (both in terms of number of employees and in scope of operational activities directly conducted by the Company)
 its corporate strategy and its focus on research and development. The Board of Directors does not have a specific role in risk oversight of the Company. The Chairman
 President and Chief Executive Officer and
 as needed
 other executive officers and employees of the Company provide the Board of Directors with information regarding the Company&#8217;s risks.




Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers
 directors and persons who own more than 10% of any class of our securities registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Officers
 directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.


Based on our review of copies of such reports
 we believe that there was compliance with all filing requirements of Section 16(a) applicable to our officers
 directors and 10% stockholders during the fiscal year ended June 30
 2013.






















The table below summarizes all compensation awarded to
 earned by
 or paid to our Chief Executive Officer
 our two most highly compensated executive officers other than our PEO who occupied such position at the end of our latest fiscal year and up to two additional executive officers who would have been included in the table below except for the fact that they were not executive officers at the end of our latest fiscal year
 by us
 or by any third party where the purpose of a transaction was to furnish compensation
 for all services rendered in all capacities to us for the latest three fiscal years ended June 30
&#160;&#160;2013 and 2012.

We have no compensation arrangements (such as fees for retainer
 committee service
 service as chairman of the board or a committee
 and meeting attendance) with directors. Our directors have not received any kind of compensation including cash
 stock
 options
 non-equity incentive plan compensation
 nonqualified deferred compensation earnings or other compensation for fiscal year&#160;2013.










The following table sets forth certain information regarding beneficial ownership of our Common Stock as of October [ ]

 (ii)&#160;each director
 executive officer and director nominee
 and (iii)&#160;all of our directors
 executive officers and director nominees as a group. As of October [ ]
 2013
 we had&#160;44
397
297&#160;shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding.

Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with SEC rules and generally includes voting or investment power with respect to securities. For purposes of this table
 a person or group of persons is deemed to have &#8220;beneficial ownership&#8221; of any shares of common stock that such person has the right to acquire within 60 days of October [ ]
 2013.&#160;&#160;For purposes of computing the percentage of outstanding shares of our common stock held by each person or group of persons named above
 any shares that such person or persons has the right to acquire within 60 days of [ ]
 2013is deemed to be outstanding for such person
 but is not deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.&#160;The inclusion herein of any shares listed as beneficially owned does not constitute an admission of beneficial ownership.&#160;Notwithstanding the foregoing
 because the Series M Preferred Stock votes on as converted basis with the Common Stock
 we have included the owners of such stock in this table.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 we calculate beneficial ownership for purposes of this table as follows:


















X= number of common stock currently outstanding
 including the shares of common stock underlying the Series M Preferred Stock since such class votes on as converted basis with the common.
