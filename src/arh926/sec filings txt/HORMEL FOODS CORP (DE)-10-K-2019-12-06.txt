food contamination caused by disease-producing organisms or pathogens
 such as 
 
federal
 state
The pathogens that may cause food contamination are found generally in livestock and in the environment and thus may be present in our products.  These pathogens can also be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling or cooking by customers or consumers.  We do not have control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution.  If one or more of these risks were to materialize
 the Company&#8217;s brand and business reputation could be negatively impacted.  In addition
 revenues could decrease
 costs of doing business could increase
The Company's business may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions
 including inflation
 interest rates
 availability of capital
 energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges)
The financial stability of our customers and suppliers may be compromised
The value of our investments in debt and equity securities may decline
 including most significantly the Company&#8217;s trading securities held as part of a rabbi trust to fund supplemental executive retirement plans and deferred income plans
The Company utilizes hedging programs to manage its exposure to various commodity market risks
 which qualify for hedge accounting for financial reporting purposes.  Volatile fluctuations in market conditions could cause these instruments to become ineffective
Additionally
 if a highly pathogenic human disease outbreak developed in the United States
 it may negatively impact the national economy
 demand for Company products
 and/or the Company&#8217;s workforce availability
 and the Company&#8217;s financial results could suffer.  The Company has developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on its operations
 and will continue to update these plans as necessary.  There can be no assurance given
 however
The Company is subject to risks associated with the outbreak of disease in pork and beef livestock
 and poultry flocks
 including African swine fever (ASF)
 Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)
 pneumo-virus
 Porcine Circovirus 2 (PCV2)
 Porcine Reproduction &amp; Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS)
 Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD)
 Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDv)
 and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI).  The outbreak of such diseases could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s supply of raw materials
 increase the cost of production
 reduce utilization of the Company&#8217;s harvest facilities
 and reduce operating margins.  Additionally
Most recently
 the outbreak of ASF in China has eliminated over 30 percent of that country's hog herd compared to last year
 according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People's Republic of China.  The disease has also spread to additional countries in Asia and Europe.  If an outbreak of ASF were to occur in the United States
The Company has developed business continuity plans for various disease scenarios and will continue to update these plans as necessary.  There can be no assurance given
 however
Fluctuations in commodity prices and availability of pork
 poultry
 beef
 feed grains
 avocados
 peanuts
 energy
The Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition are largely dependent upon the cost and supply of pork
 poultry
 beef
 feed grains
 avocados
 peanuts
 and whey as well as energy costs and the selling prices for many of our products
The live hog industry has evolved to large
 vertically-integrated operations using long-term supply agreements.  This has resulted in fewer hogs being available on the cash spot market.  Consequently
 the Company uses long-term supply contracts based on market-based formulas or the cost of production to ensure a stable supply of raw materials while minimizing extreme fluctuations in costs over the long-term.  This may result
 in the short-term
 in higher live hog costs compared to the cash spot market depending on the relationship of the cash spot market to contract prices.  Market-based pricing on certain product lines
 and lead time required to implement pricing adjustments
 may prevent all or part of these cost increases from being recovered
Jennie-O Turkey Store raises turkeys and contracts with turkey growers to meet its raw material requirements for whole birds and processed turkey products.  Results in these operations are affected by the cost and supply of feed grains
 which fluctuate due to climate conditions
 production forecasts
 and supply and demand conditions at local
 regional
 national
 and worldwide markets.  The Company attempts to manage some of its short-term exposure to fluctuations in feed prices by forward buying
 using futures contracts
 and pursuing pricing advances.  However
The supplies of natural and organic proteins may impact the Company&#8217;s ability to ensure a continuing supply of these products.  To mitigate this risk
International trade barriers and other restrictions could result in decreased foreign demand and increased domestic supply of proteins
The Company faces competition from producers of alternative meats and protein sources
 including pork
 beef
 turkey
 chicken
 fish
 nut butters
 whey
Demand for the Company&#8217;s products is also affected by competitors&#8217; promotional spending
 the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s advertising and marketing programs
 and consumer perceptions.  Failure to identify and react to changes in food trends such as sustainability of product sources and animal welfare could lead to
 among other things
The Company has made several acquisitions and divestitures in recent years that align with the Company&#8217;s strategic initiative of delivering long-term value to shareholders.  The Company regularly reviews strategic opportunities to grow through acquisitions and to divest non-strategic assets.  Potential risks associated with these transactions include the the inability to consummate a transaction on favorable terms
 the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns
 the potential loss of key employees and customers of current or acquired companies
 the inability to integrate or divest operations successfully
 the possible assumption of unknown liabilities
 potential disputes with buyers or sellers
 potential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved
 and the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which the Company has limited or no prior experience.  Any or all of these risks could impact the Company&#8217;s financial results and business reputation.  In addition
Disruption of operations at co&#8209;packers or other suppliers may impact the Company&#8217;s product or raw material supply
 which could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial results.  Additionally
 actions taken to mitigate the impact of any potential disruption
 including increasing inventory in anticipation of a potential production or supply interruption
The Company is involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.  Trends in litigation may include class actions involving employees
 consumers
 competitors
 suppliers
 shareholders
 or injured persons
 and claims relating to product liability
 contract disputes
 intellectual property
 advertising
 labeling
 wage and hour laws
 employment practices
The Company is a party to several supply
 distribution

Government regulation
 present and future
The Company&#8217;s operations are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security
 the U.S. Department of Agriculture
 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
 federal and state taxing authorities
 and other federal
 state
 and local authorities who oversee workforce immigration laws
 tax regulations
 animal welfare

 and the processing
 packaging
 storage
 distribution
 advertising
 and labeling of the Company&#8217;s products.  The Company&#8217;s manufacturing facilities and products are subject to continuous inspection by federal
 state
 and local authorities.  Claims or enforcement proceedings could be brought against the Company in the future.  The availability of government inspectors due to a government furlough could also cause disruption to the Company&#8217;s manufacturing facilities.  Additionally
 the Company is subject to new or modified laws
 regulations
 and accounting standards.  The Company&#8217;s failure or inability to comply with such requirements could subject the Company to civil remedies
 including fines
 injunctions
 recalls
 or seizures
The Company is subject to stringent environmental regulation and potentially subject to environmental litigation
 proceedings
The Company&#8217;s past and present business operations and ownership and operation of real property are subject to stringent federal
 state
 and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes (including solid and hazardous wastes) or otherwise relating to protection of the environment.  Compliance with these laws and regulations
 as well as any modifications
 is material to the Company&#8217;s business.  Some of the Company&#8217;s facilities have been in operation for many years and
 over time
 the Company and other prior operators of these facilities may have generated and disposed of wastes that now may be considered hazardous.  Future discovery of contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of the Company&#8217;s present or former properties or manufacturing facilities and/or waste disposal sites could require the Company to incur additional expenses related to additional investigation
 assessment or other requirements.  The occurrence of any of these events
 the implementation of new laws and regulations
The Company operates its business and markets its products internationally.  The Company&#8217;s foreign operations are subject to the risks described above
 as well as risks related to fluctuations in currency values
 foreign currency exchange controls
 compliance with foreign laws
 compliance with applicable U.S. laws
 including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 and other economic or political uncertainties.  International sales are subject to risks related to general economic conditions
 imposition of tariffs
 quotas
 trade barriers and other restrictions
 enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and compliance with applicable foreign laws
 and other economic and political uncertainties.  All of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues
The Company may be adversely impacted if the Company is unable to protect information technology systems against
 or effectively respond to
In addition
 the Company is in the middle of a transformation project (Project Orion) to achieve better analytics
 customer service
 and process efficiencies through the use of Oracle Cloud Solutions.  This project is expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes and the underlying systems environment.  Implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years
 beginning in fiscal 2020.  Such an implementation is a major undertaking from a financial
 management
 and personnel perspective.  The implementation of the enterprise resource planning system may prove to be more difficult
 costly
 or time consuming than expected
In an attempt to mitigate these risks
October 27
 2019
 the Company had approximately 18
800 employees worldwide
 of which approximately 3
310 were represented by labor unions
 principally the United Food and Commercial Workers Union.  A significant increase in labor costs or a deterioration of labor relations at any of the Company&#8217;s facilities or contracted hog processing facilities resulting in work slowdowns or stoppages could harm the Company&#8217;s financial results.  The union contract at one of the Company's facilities will expire during fiscal 2020
The Company's global headquarters are located in Austin

Sales for the year were $9.5 billion
See explanation of non-GAAP financial measures in the Consolidated Results section).  Pretax earnings increased 2 percent to $1
209.7 million. Profit growth from the value-added businesses in Refrigerated Foods and lower selling
 general and administrative expenses more than offset a significant decline in commodity profits and lower equity in earnings of affiliates.  A higher effective tax rate drove net earnings attributable to the Company lower by 3 percent to $978.8 million
 compared to net earnings of $1
012.1 million last year.  The effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 increased primarily due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) recognized in fiscal 2018.  Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2019 were $1.80
Refrigerated Foods segment results exceeded last year due to growth from the value-added businesses
&#160;deli items also contributed to overall growth

 Project Orion
 and many other items to support growth of branded products.  The annual dividend for 2020 will be $0.93 per share and marks the 54th consecutive year of dividend increases
 representing an increase of 11 percent after a 12 percent increase in fiscal 2019.  We repurchased 4.3 million shares of common stock in fiscal 2019

The effective tax rate for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year reflects the impact of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
 signed into law on December 22
 2017.  Fiscal 2018 included a net tax benefit of $72.9 million representing a benefit of $81.2 million from re-measuring the Company&#8217;s net U.S. deferred tax liabilities
 partially offset by the Company&#8217;s accrual for the transition tax and other U.S. tax law changes of $8.3 million.  In addition to tax reform
 the tax impacts of the CytoSport divestiture and stock-based compensation were the main drivers of the Company's fiscal 2019 effective tax rates for the fourth quarter and fiscal year compared to the prior year.  For additional information
Net sales and operating profits for each of the Company&#8217;s reportable segments are set forth below.  The Company is an integrated enterprise

The lower effective tax rate for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year reflects the impact of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
 signed into law on December 22
 2017.  For fiscal 2018
 the Company recorded a net tax benefit of $72.9 million.  This provisional net tax benefit arises from a benefit of $81.2 million from re-measuring the Company&#8217;s net U.S. deferred tax liabilities
 partially offset by the Company&#8217;s accrual for the transition tax and other U.S. tax law changes of $8.3 million.  These one-time tax events and reduction in the federal statutory tax rate were the main drivers of the Company's effective tax rates for the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 18.7 percent and 14.3 percent
 respectively
 compared to 33.8 percent and 33.7 percent for the respective periods last year.  For additional information
Net sales and operating profits for each of the Company&#8217;s reportable segments are set forth below.  The Company is an integrated enterprise

This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements
 which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP).  The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates
 judgments
Critical accounting policies are defined as those reflective of significant judgments
 estimates
 and uncertainties
 The Company recognizes sales at the point in time when the performance obligation has been satisfied
 and control of the product has transferred to the customer.  Obligations for the Company are usually fulfilled once shipped product is received or picked up by the customer.  Revenue is recorded net of applicable provisions for discounts
 returns
The Company offers various sales incentives to customers and consumers.  Incentives offered off-invoice include prompt pay allowances
 will call allowances
 spoilage allowances
 and temporary price reductions.  These incentives are recognized as reductions of revenue at the time title passes.  Coupons are used as an incentive for consumers to purchase various products.  The coupons reduce revenues at the time they are offered
 The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  For pork inventories
 when the carcasses are disassembled and transferred from primal processing to various manufacturing departments
 the primal values
 as adjusted by the Company for product specifications and further processing
 become the basis for calculating inventory values.  Turkey raw materials are represented by the deboned meat quantities.  The Company values these raw materials using a concept referred to as the &#8220;meat cost pool.&#8221;  The meat cost pool is determined by combining the cost to grow turkeys with processing costs
 less any net sales revenue from by-products created from the processing and not used in producing Company products.  The Company has developed a series of ratios using historical data and current market conditions (which themselves involve estimates and judgment determinations by the Company) to allocate the meat cost pool to each meat component.  Substantially all inventoriable expenses

 Estimating the fair value of the Company&#8217;s goodwill reporting units and intangible assets requires significant judgment upon initial valuation.  Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment.  Certain acquired brands are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and the Company&#8217;s plans to continue to support and build the brands.  Other acquired assets such as customer relationships
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are originally recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and the residual of the purchase price is recorded to goodwill.  Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are allocated to reporting units that will receive the related sales and income.  Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment
In conducting the annual impairment test for goodwill
 the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (&gt; 50% likelihood) the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  If a qualitative assessment determines an impairment is more likely than not
 the Company is required to perform a quantitative impairment test.  Otherwise
 no further analysis is required.  Alternatively
In conducting a qualitative assessment
 the Company analyzes actual and projected growth trends for net sales
 gross margin
 and segment profit for each reporting unit
 as well as historical performance versus plan and the results of prior quantitative tests performed.  Additionally
 the Company assesses critical areas that may impact its business
 including macroeconomic conditions and the related impact
 market-related exposures
 any plans to market for sale all or a portion of their business
 competitive changes
 new or discontinued product lines
 changes in key personnel
If performed
 the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level.  First
 the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its corresponding carrying value
 including goodwill.  The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using discounted cash flow valuations (Level 3)
 which incorporate assumptions regarding future growth rates
 terminal values
 and discount rates.  The estimates and assumptions used consider historical performance and are consistent with the assumptions used in determining future profit plans for each reporting unit
 which are approved by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors.  If the quantitative assessment results in the carrying value exceeding the fair value of any reporting unit
 then the results from the quantitative analysis will be relied upon to determine both the existence and amount of goodwill impairment.  An impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount exceeds its fair value
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019
In conducting the annual impairment test for its indefinite-lived intangible assets
 the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (&gt; 50% likelihood) that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.  If the Company concludes this is the case
 then a quantitative test for impairment must be performed. Otherwise
In conducting the initial qualitative assessment
 the Company analyzes growth rates for historical and projected net sales and the results of prior quantitative tests performed.  Additionally
If performed
 the quantitative impairment test compares the fair value to the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.  The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is primarily determined on the basis of estimated discounted value
 using the relief from royalty method (Level 3).  This method incorporates assumptions regarding future sales projections
 discount rates
 and royalty rates. If the carrying value exceeds fair value
 the indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recorded.  Even if not required
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019
 the Company completed its annual indefinite-live impairment tests and elected to perform a qualitative assessment.  During the qualitative review
 it was revealed that further assessment in the form of a quantitative test was necessary for certain indefinite-lived intangible assets with a combined carrying value less than $100 million.  No impairment charges were recorded for 2019
 however
 these assets were determined to have fair values exceeding their carrying value by less than a 10 percent margin.  Management has implemented strategies to address the nominal excess value
 however
During fiscal 2018

 The Company incurs expenses relating to employee benefits
 such as noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement health care benefits.  In accounting for these employment costs and the associated liabilities
 management must make a variety of assumptions and estimates including mortality rates
 discount rates
 compensation increases
 expected return on plan assets
Benefit plan assets are stated at fair value.  Due to the lack of readily available market prices
 private equity investments are valued by models using a combination of available market data and unobservable inputs that consider earnings multiples
 discounted cash flows
 and other qualitative and quantitative factors.  Other benefit plan investments are measured at Net Asset Value (NAV) per share of the fund's underlying investments as a practical expedient.  These valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect
 resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to mitigate these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds&#8217; judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds&#8217; financial statements for reasonableness.  The Company also holds quarterly meetings with the investment adviser to review fund performance
 which include comparisons to the relevant indices.  On an annual basis
The Company computes its provision for income taxes based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it operates.  Judgment is required in evaluating the Company&#8217;s tax positions and determining its annual tax provision.  While the Company considers all of its tax positions fully supportable
 the Company is occasionally challenged by various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due.  The Company recognizes a tax position in its financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination
 At any time
 the Company may be subject to investigations
 legal proceedings
 or claims related to the ongoing operation of its business
 including claims both by and against the Company.  Such proceedings typically involve claims related to product liability
 contract disputes
 wage and hour laws
 employment practices
 or other actions brought by employees
 consumers
 competitors
 or suppliers.  The Company routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes related to these matters on a case by case basis
 as well as the potential ranges of losses and fees.  The Company establishes accruals for its potential exposure
 as appropriate
 for claims against the Company when losses become probable and reasonably estimable.  Where the Company is able to reasonably estimate a range of potential losses
 the Company records the amount within that range which constitutes the Company&#8217;s best estimate.  The Company also discloses the nature and range of loss for claims against the Company when losses are reasonably possible and material.  These accruals and disclosures are determined based on the facts and circumstances related to the individual cases and require estimates and judgments regarding the interpretation of facts and laws

  The Company&#8217;s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the live hog market.  To minimize the impact on earnings and ensure a steady supply of quality hogs
 the Company has entered into contracts with producers for the purchase of hogs at formula-based prices over periods of up to 10 years.  Hogs purchased under contract accounted for 93 percent and 96 percent of the total hogs purchased by the Company during fiscal 2019 and 2018
 respectively.  The majority of these contracts use market-based formulas based on hog futures
 hog primal values
 or industry reported hog markets. Other contracts use a formula based on the cost of production
 which can fluctuate independently from hog markets.  The Company&#8217;s value-added branded portfolio helps mitigate changes in hog and pork market prices.  Therefore

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
 assessing the risk that a material weakness exists
 testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk
A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions

 the consolidated financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company at October 27
 2019 and October 28
 2018
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 27

We also have audited
 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)
 the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 27
 2019
 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework)
 and our report dated December 6
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging
 subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements
 taken as a whole

 by communicating the critical audit matters below
At October 27
 2019
 the Company had $1.5 billion in plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans. Approximately 43% of the total pension assets are in global stocks - collective investment funds
 private equity funds
 real estate - domestic funds
 and hedge funds. These types of investments are referred to as &#8220;alternative investments.&#8221; As documented in Note G of the financial statements
Auditing the fair value of these alternative investments is challenging because of the higher estimation uncertainty of the inputs to the fair value calculations
 including the underlying NAVs
 discounted cash flow valuations
 comparable market valuations
 and adjustments for currency
 credit liquidity and other risks. Additionally
We obtained an understanding
 evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls addressing the risk of material misstatement relating to valuation of alternative investments. This included testing management's review controls over the valuation of alternative investments
 for example
Our audit procedures included
 among others
 inquiring of management and the investment advisor regarding changes to the investment portfolio and investment strategies. We confirmed the fair value of the investments and ownership interest directly with the fund managers. We inspected the trust statement for observable transactions near year end to compare to the estimated fair value. We also obtained the latest audited financial statements for certain investments
 performed a rollforward of the investment balance to compute an estimated market return on investment
At October 27
 2019
 the Company&#8217;s indefinite-lived intangible assets relating to brands
 tradenames
 and trademarks were $956.8 million. As explained in Note D of the financial statements
 indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by management for impairment at least annually. Due to the lack of excess value of certain trade names with combined carrying values representing less than $100 million
Auditing management&#8217;s quantitative indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant measurement uncertainty in determining the fair value of the asset which was subject to a quantitative impairment test. For example
 the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant assumptions including future net sales projections
 royalty rates
 and discount rates
We obtained an understanding
 evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company&#8217;s indefinite lived intangible assets quantitative impairment test. This included evaluating controls over management's review of the forecasting process used to develop future net sales projections
Our audit procedures included
 among others
 assessing methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to forecasts used in the Company&#8217;s annual operating plans
 current industry and economic trends
 and other relevant factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of management&#8217;s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the trade names that would result from changes in the assumptions. Finally

  The Company maintains a rabbi trust to fund certain supplemental executive retirement plans and deferred compensation plans.  Under the plans
 participants can defer certain types of compensation and elect to receive a return on the deferred amounts based on the changes in fair value of various investment options
 primarily a variety of mutual funds.  The Company has corporate-owned life insurance policies on certain participants in the deferred compensation plans.  The cash surrender value of the policies is included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  The securities held by the trust are classified as trading securities.  Therefore
 unrealized losses and gains associated with these investments are included in the Company&#8217;s earnings.

  Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.  The Company reviews long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually
value of the assets and any related goodwill
 the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value.
 
In conducting the annual impairment test for goodwill
 the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (&gt; 50% likelihood) the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  If the Company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines an impairment is more likely than not
 the Company is required to perform a quantitative impairment test.  Otherwise
 no further analysis is required.  Alternatively
In conducting a qualitative assessment
 the Company analyzes actual and projected growth trends for net sales
 gross margin
 and segment profit for each reporting unit
 as well as historical performance versus plan and the results of prior quantitative tests.  Additionally
 the Company assesses factors that may impact the business's financial results such as macroeconomic conditions and the related impact
 market-related exposures
 plans to market for sale all or a portion of the business
 competitive changes
 new or discontinued product lines
If performed
 the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level.  First
 the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its corresponding carrying value
 including goodwill.  The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using discounted cash flow valuations (Level 3)
 which incorporate assumptions regarding future growth rates
 terminal values
 and discount rates.  The estimates and assumptions used consider historical performance and are consistent with the assumptions used in determining future profit plans for each reporting unit
 which are approved by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors.  If the quantitative assessment results in the carrying value exceeding the fair value of any reporting unit
 the results from the quantitative analysis will be relied upon to determine both the existence and amount of goodwill impairment.  An impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount exceeds its fair value
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019
 the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests and elected to perform a qualitative assessment.  As a result of the qualitative testing during fiscal 2019 and 2018

In conducting the annual impairment test for its indefinite-lived intangible assets

In conducting the qualitative assessment
 the Company analyzes growth rates for historical and projected net sales and the results of prior quantitative tests.  Additionally
If performed
 the quantitative impairment test compares the fair value and carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.  The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is primarily determined on the basis of estimated discounted value using the relief from royalty method (Level 3)
 which incorporates assumptions regarding future sales projections
 discount rates
 and royalty rates.  If the carrying value exceeds fair value
 the indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference.  Even if not required

 The Company has elected to use the corridor approach to recognize expenses related to its defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.  Under the corridor approach
 actuarial gains or losses resulting from experience and changes in assumptions are deferred and amortized over future periods.  For the defined benefit pension plans
 the unrecognized gains and losses are amortized when the net gain or loss exceeds 10.0% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year.  For the other post-retirement plans
 the unrecognized gains and losses are amortized when the net gain or loss exceeds 10.0% of the accumulated pension benefit obligation at the beginning of the year.  For plans with active employees

 guidance for transactions which were not previously addressed
 and improves guidance for multiple-element arrangements.  The new guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&#160;15
In October&#160;2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-16
.  The updated guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity asset transfer
 other than transfers of inventory
 when the transfer occurs.  For intra-entity transfers of inventory
 the income tax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party.  The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December&#160;15
 2017
 with early adoption permitted only within the first interim period of a fiscal year.  The guidance is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.  The Company adopted the updated provisions at the beginning of fiscal 2019
 resulting in a reclassification from prepaid tax assets to deferred tax assets.  In addition
 due to the impact of the lower tax rate on deferred tax balances resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act)
In March&#160;2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-07
.  The updated guidance requires an employer to report the service cost component of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit cost in the same line item as other compensation costs.  Other components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit cost must be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside income from operations.  Additionally
 only the service cost component is eligible for capitalization.  This guidance was effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December&#160;15
 2017.  The updated guidance should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of components of net benefit cost and prospectively for the capitalization of the service cost component of net benefit cost.  The Company adopted the updated provisions at the beginning of fiscal 2019.  The Company elected to utilize a practical expedient which allows the Company to use historical amounts disclosed in the Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits footnote as an estimation basis for retrospectively applying the requirements to separately report the other components in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Due to the retrospective adoption

.  The updated guidance expands an entity&#8217;s ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components and reduce complexity in fair value hedges of interest rate risk.  The guidance eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item.  The guidance also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements and modifies the accounting for components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.  Entities will apply the amendments to cash flow and net investment hedge relationships that exist on the date of adoption using a modified retrospective approach.  The presentation and disclosure requirements apply prospectively.  The updated guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those years.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period.  The Company early adopted the updated guidance at the beginning of fiscal 2019; therefore
In February&#160;2018

The updated guidance allows entities to reclassify stranded income tax effects resulting from the Tax Act from Accumulated Other comprehensive income to retained earnings in their consolidated financial statements.  Under the Tax Act
 deferred taxes were adjusted to reflect the reduction of the historical corporate income tax rate to the newly enacted corporate income tax rate
 which left the tax effects on items within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss stranded at an inappropriate tax rate.  The updated guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those years.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim period and should be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Act is recognized.  The Company early adopted the updated provisions at the beginning of fiscal 2019

 or make minor improvements to the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC).  The transition and effective date guidance is based on the facts and circumstances of each amendment.  Some of the amendments do not require transition guidance and will be effective upon issuance of ASU 2018-09.  The amendments effective upon issuance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  A majority of the amendments do have transition guidance with effective dates for annual periods beginning after December 15
In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15
&#160; The amendments in the update align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license).  The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 and for interim periods within those fiscal years and is to be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the adoption date.  Early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in any interim period.  The Company early adopted the updated provisions on a prospective basis at the beginning of fiscal 2019.  Subsequent to adoption

 measurement
 and presentation of expenses will depend on the classification as a finance or operating lease.  The update also requires expanded quantitative and qualitative disclosures.  Accounting guidance for lessors is largely unchanged.  The requirements of the new standard are effective for fiscal years beginning after December&#160;15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company will adopt the provisions of this new accounting standard at the beginning of fiscal 2020.  For transition purposes
 the Company elected the package of practical expedients to not reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases
 lease classification
 and initial direct costs.  In July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-11
 which provides an optional transition method allowing entities the option to use the effective date as the date of initial application on transition.  The Company elected this transition method
 and as a result
 the Company will not adjust its comparative period financial information or make the new required lease disclosures for periods before the effective date.  The Company elected to not separate lease and non-lease components.  The Company did not elect the hindsight practical expedient.  In connection with the adoption of the new lease accounting standard
 the Company completed scoping reviews and developed business processes
 accounting policies and internal controls.  The Company implemented new lease accounting software to provide a centralized repository and assist in the preparation of the standard's additional reporting requirements.  Based on the assessment to-date
In June&#160;2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-13
.  The update provides guidance on the measurement of credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income.  The amendment replaces the current incurred loss impairment approach with a methodology to reflect expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to explain credit loss estimates.  The updated guidance is to be applied on a modified retrospective approach and is effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December&#160;15
 2019.  Early adoption is permitted for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December&#160;15

In August 2018

The updated guidance requires entities to disclose changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements.  Amendments in this guidance also require disclosure of transfers into and out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy
 purchases and issues of Level 3 assets and liabilities
 and clarify that the measurement uncertainty disclosure is about the uncertainty in measurement as of the reporting date.  The guidance removes requirements to disclose the amounts and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2

 and interim periods within those fiscal years

In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-14
.  The updated guidance requires additional disclosures of weighted-average interest crediting rates for cash balance plans and an explanation of the reasons for significant gains and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation.  Amendments in the guidance also clarify the requirement to disclose the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and fair value of plan assets for plans with PBOs in excess of plan assets.  The same disclosure is needed for the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and fair value of plan assets for plans with ABOs in excess of plan assets.  The guidance removes certain previous disclosure requirements no longer considered cost beneficial.  The amendments are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15

 the Company adopted ASC 606
 using the full retrospective adoption method.  The impact of adopting this guidance was immaterial to the Company&#8217;s financial statements and related disclosures.  Under ASC 606
 a contract with a customer is an agreement which both parties have approved
 that creates enforceable rights and obligations
 has commercial substance
 where payment terms are identified
 and collectability is probable.  The Company&#8217;s customer contracts predominantly contain a single performance obligation to fulfill customer orders for the purchase of specified products.  A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer.  Revenue from product sales is primarily identified by purchase orders (&#8220;contracts&#8221;) which in some cases are governed by a master sales agreement.  The purchase orders in combination with the invoice typically specify quantity and product(s) ordered
 shipping terms
 and certain aspects of the transaction price including discounts.  Contracts are at standalone pricing or governed by pricing lists or brackets.  The Company's revenue is recognized at the point in time when performance obligations have been satisfied
 and control of the product has transferred to the customer. This is typically once the shipped product is received or picked up by the customer.  Revenues are recognized at the net consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for the goods.  The amount of net consideration recognized includes estimates of variable consideration
 including costs for trade promotion programs
 consumer incentives
The Company promotes products through advertising
 consumer incentives
 and trade promotions.  These programs include discounts

estimates variable consideration at the expected value method to determine the total consideration which the Company expects to be entitled.  Estimated amounts are included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.  The Company&#8217;s estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of anticipated performance and all information (historical

On December 22
 2017
 the United States enacted comprehensive tax legislation into law
 H.R. 1
 commonly referred to as The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act).  Except for certain provisions
 the Tax Act was effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1
 2018.  As a fiscal year U.S. taxpayer
 the majority of the provisions
 such as eliminating the domestic manufacturing deduction
 creating new taxes on certain foreign sourced income
 and introducing new limitations on certain business deductions
 became effective for the Company in fiscal 2019.  The global intangible low taxed income (GILTI) and foreign derived intangible income (FDII) provisions became effective for fiscal 2019 and resulted in an immaterial impact to the Company.  For fiscal 2018
 the most significant impacts included lowering of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate
 remeasuring certain net deferred tax liabilities
 for fiscal 2018

As part of the annual valuation process
 the Company reassesses the appropriateness of the inputs used in the valuation models.  The Company establishes the risk-free interest rate using stripped U.S. Treasury yields as of the grant date where the remaining term is approximately the expected life of the option.  The dividend yield is based on the dividend rate approved by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors and the stock price on the grant date.  The expected volatility assumption is based primarily on historical volatility.  As a reasonableness test
 implied volatility from exchange traded options is also examined to validate the volatility range obtained from the historical analysis.  The expected life assumption is based on an analysis of past exercise behavior by option holders.  In performing the valuations for option grants
:  Restricted shares awarded to non-employee directors on February 1 are subject to a restricted period which expires at the date of the Company&#8217;s next annual stockholders meeting.  Newly elected directors receive a prorated award of restricted shares of the Company's common stock

The Company&#8217;s cash equivalents considered Level 1 consist primarily of bank deposits
 money market funds rated AAA
 or other highly liquid investment accounts
The Company holds securities as part of a portfolio maintained to generate investment income and to provide cash for operations of the Company
 if necessary.  The portfolio is managed by a third party who is responsible for daily trading activities and all assets within the portfolio are highly liquid.  The cash
 U.S. government securities
 and money market funds rated AAA held by the portfolio are classified as Level 1.  The current investment portfolio also includes corporate bonds and other asset backed securities for which there is an active
 quoted market.  Market prices are obtained from a variety of industry providers
 large financial institutions
 and other third-party sources to calculate a representative daily market value
 and therefore
A majority of the funds held in the rabbi trust relate to the supplemental executive retirement plans and have been invested in fixed income funds managed by a third party.&#160; The declared rate on these funds is set based on a formula using the yield of the general account investment portfolio supporting the fund
 adjusted for expenses and other charges.&#160; The rate is guaranteed for one year at issue and may be reset annually on the policy anniversary
 subject to a guaranteed minimum rate.&#160; As the value is based on adjusted market rates and the fixed rate is only reset on an annual basis
 these funds are classified as Level 2.&#160; The funds held in the rabbi trust are included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.&#160; The remaining funds held are also managed by a third-party insurance policy
 the values of which represent their cash surrender value based on the fair value of the underlying investments in the account and include equity securities
 money market accounts
 bond funds
 or other portfolios for which there is an active quoted market.&#160; Therefore
 these policies are also classified as Level 2.  The Company also offers a fixed rate investment option to participants.  The rate earned on these investments is adjusted annually based on a specified percentage of the I.R.S. applicable federal rates.  These balances are classified as Level 2.  The related deferred compensation liabilities are included in Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position with investment options generally mirroring those funds held by the rabbi trust.&#160; Therefore
(4)  The Company&#8217;s commodity derivatives represent futures contracts and options used in its hedging or other programs to offset price fluctuations associated with purchases of corn
 soybean meal
 and hogs
 and to minimize the price risk assumed when forward priced contracts are offered to the Company&#8217;s commodity suppliers.&#160; The Company&#8217;s futures contracts for corn and soybean meal are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade
 while futures contracts for lean hogs are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.&#160; These are active markets with quoted prices available
 and these contracts are classified as Level 1.  Over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments are valued using discounted cashflow models
 observable market inputs
 and other mathematical pricing models.  The Company&#8217;s lean hog option contracts are OTC instruments whose value is calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model
 lean hog future prices quoted from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
 and other adjustments to inputs that are observable in active markets.  As the value of these instruments is driven by observable prices in active markets they are classified as Level 2.  All derivatives are reviewed for potential credit risk and risk of nonperformance.&#160; The Company nets the derivative assets and liabilities for each of its hedging programs
 including cash collateral
 when a master netting arrangement exists between the Company and the counterparty to the derivative contract.&#160; The net balance for each program is included in Other current assets or Accounts payable
 as appropriate

The Company&#8217;s cash equivalents considered Level 1 consist primarily of bank deposits
 money market funds rated AAA
 or other highly liquid investment accounts
The Company holds securities as part of a portfolio maintained to generate investment income and to provide cash for operations of the Company
 if necessary.  The portfolio is managed by a third party who is responsible for daily trading activities and all assets within the portfolio are highly liquid.  The cash
 U.S. government securities
 and money market funds rated AAA held by the portfolio are classified as Level 1.  The current investment portfolio also includes corporate bonds and other asset backed securities for which there is an active
 quoted market.  Market prices are obtained from a variety of industry providers
 large financial institutions
 and other third-party sources to calculate a representative daily market value
 and therefore
A majority of the funds held in the rabbi trust relate to the supplemental executive retirement plans and have been invested in fixed income funds managed by a third party.&#160; The declared rate on these funds is set based on a formula using the yield of the general account investment portfolio supporting the fund
 adjusted for expenses and other charges.&#160; The rate is guaranteed for one year at issue and may be reset annually on the policy anniversary
 subject to a guaranteed minimum rate.&#160; As the value is based on adjusted market rates and the fixed rate is only reset on an annual basis
 these funds are classified as Level 2.&#160; The funds held in the rabbi trust are included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.&#160; The remaining funds held are also managed by a third-party insurance policy
 the values of which represent their cash surrender value based on the fair value of the underlying investments in the account and include equity securities
 money market accounts
 bond funds
 or other portfolios for which there is an active quoted market.&#160; Therefore
 these policies are also classified as Level 2.  The Company also offers a fixed rate investment option to participants.  The rate earned on these investments is adjusted annually based on a specified percentage of the I.R.S. applicable federal rates.  These balances are classified as Level 2.  The related deferred compensation liabilities are included in Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position with investment options generally mirroring those funds held by the rabbi trust.&#160; Therefore
(4)  The Company&#8217;s commodity derivatives represent futures contracts and options used in its hedging or other programs to offset price fluctuations associated with purchases of corn
 soybean meal
 and hogs
 and to minimize the price risk assumed when forward priced contracts are offered to the Company&#8217;s commodity suppliers.&#160; The Company&#8217;s futures contracts for corn and soybean meal are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade
 while futures contracts for lean hogs are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.&#160; These are active markets with quoted prices available
 and these contracts are classified as Level 1.  Over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments are valued using discounted cashflow models
 observable market inputs
 and other mathematical pricing models.  The Company&#8217;s lean hog option contracts are OTC instruments whose value is calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model
 lean hog future prices quoted from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
 and other adjustments to inputs that are observable in active markets.  As the value of these instruments is driven by observable prices in active markets they are classified as Level 2.  All derivatives are reviewed for potential credit risk and risk of nonperformance.&#160; The Company nets the derivative assets and liabilities for each of its hedging programs
 including cash collateral
 when a master netting arrangement exists between the Company and the counterparty to the derivative contract.&#160; The net balance for each program is included in Other current assets or Accounts payable
 as appropriate
October 27

The Company&#8217;s financial assets and liabilities include accounts receivable
 accounts payable
 and other liabilities
 for which carrying value approximates fair value.  The Company does not carry its long-term debt at fair value in its Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  The fair value of long-term debt
 utilizing discounted cash flows (Level 2)

In accordance with the provisions of ASC 820
 the Company measures certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value
 which are recognized or disclosed on a nonrecurring basis (e.g. goodwill
 intangible assets
 and property
 plant and equipment).  During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018
 a 
 
 and 
 there were no other material remeasurements of assets or liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis subsequent to their initial recognition.



































The entire disclosure for the fair value of financial instruments (as defined)
 including financial assets and financial liabilities (collectively
 as defined)
 and the measurements of those instruments as well as disclosures related to the fair value of non-financial assets and liabilities. Such disclosures about the financial instruments
 assets
 and liabilities would include: (1) the fair value of the required items together with their carrying amounts (as appropriate); (2) for items for which it is not practicable to estimate fair value
 disclosure would include: (a) information pertinent to estimating fair value (including
 carrying amount
 effective interest rate
 and maturity
 and (b) the reasons why it is not practicable to estimate fair value; (3) significant concentrations of credit risk including: (a) information about the activity
 region
 or economic characteristics identifying a concentration
 (b) the maximum amount of loss the entity is exposed to based on the gross fair value of the related item
 (c) policy for requiring collateral or other security and information as to accessing such collateral or security
 and (d) the nature and brief description of such collateral or security; (4) quantitative information about market risks and how such risks are managed; (5) for items measured on both a recurring and nonrecurring basis information regarding the inputs used to develop the fair value measurement; and (6) for items presented in the financial statement for which fair value measurement is elected: (a) information necessary to understand the reasons for the election
 (b) discussion of the effect of fair value changes on earnings
 (c) a description of [similar groups] items for which the election is made and the relation thereof to the balance sheet
 the aggregate carrying value of items included in the balance sheet that are not eligible for the election; (7) all other required (as defined) and desired information.

The Company&#8217;s cash equivalents considered Level 1 consist primarily of bank deposits
 money market funds rated AAA
 or other highly liquid investment accounts
The Company holds securities as part of a portfolio maintained to generate investment income and to provide cash for operations of the Company
 if necessary.  The portfolio is managed by a third party who is responsible for daily trading activities and all assets within the portfolio are highly liquid.  The cash
 U.S. government securities
 and money market funds rated AAA held by the portfolio are classified as Level 1.  The current investment portfolio also includes corporate bonds and other asset backed securities for which there is an active
 quoted market.  Market prices are obtained from a variety of industry providers
 large financial institutions
 and other third-party sources to calculate a representative daily market value
 and therefore
A majority of the funds held in the rabbi trust relate to the supplemental executive retirement plans and have been invested in fixed income funds managed by a third party.&#160; The declared rate on these funds is set based on a formula using the yield of the general account investment portfolio supporting the fund
 adjusted for expenses and other charges.&#160; The rate is guaranteed for one year at issue and may be reset annually on the policy anniversary
 subject to a guaranteed minimum rate.&#160; As the value is based on adjusted market rates and the fixed rate is only reset on an annual basis
 these funds are classified as Level 2.&#160; The funds held in the rabbi trust are included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.&#160; The remaining funds held are also managed by a third-party insurance policy
 the values of which represent their cash surrender value based on the fair value of the underlying investments in the account and include equity securities
 money market accounts
 bond funds
 or other portfolios for which there is an active quoted market.&#160; Therefore
 these policies are also classified as Level 2.  The Company also offers a fixed rate investment option to participants.  The rate earned on these investments is adjusted annually based on a specified percentage of the I.R.S. applicable federal rates.  These balances are classified as Level 2.  The related deferred compensation liabilities are included in Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position with investment options generally mirroring those funds held by the rabbi trust.&#160; Therefore
(4)  The Company&#8217;s commodity derivatives represent futures contracts and options used in its hedging or other programs to offset price fluctuations associated with purchases of corn
 soybean meal
 and hogs
 and to minimize the price risk assumed when forward priced contracts are offered to the Company&#8217;s commodity suppliers.&#160; The Company&#8217;s futures contracts for corn and soybean meal are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade
 while futures contracts for lean hogs are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.&#160; These are active markets with quoted prices available
 and these contracts are classified as Level 1.  Over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments are valued using discounted cashflow models
 observable market inputs
 and other mathematical pricing models.  The Company&#8217;s lean hog option contracts are OTC instruments whose value is calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model
 lean hog future prices quoted from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
 and other adjustments to inputs that are observable in active markets.  As the value of these instruments is driven by observable prices in active markets they are classified as Level 2.  All derivatives are reviewed for potential credit risk and risk of nonperformance.&#160; The Company nets the derivative assets and liabilities for each of its hedging programs
 including cash collateral
 when a master netting arrangement exists between the Company and the counterparty to the derivative contract.&#160; The net balance for each program is included in Other current assets or Accounts payable
 as appropriate

 segregating fair value measurements using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1)
 significant other observable inputs (Level 2)
 and significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).

  The Company maintains a rabbi trust to fund certain supplemental executive retirement plans and deferred compensation plans.  Under the plans
 participants can defer certain types of compensation and elect to receive a return on the deferred amounts based on the changes in fair value of various investment options
 primarily a variety of mutual funds.  The Company has corporate-owned life insurance policies on certain participants in the deferred compensation plans.  The cash surrender value of the policies is included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  The securities held by the trust are classified as trading securities.  Therefore

In conducting the annual impairment test for goodwill
 the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (&gt; 50% likelihood) the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  If the Company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines an impairment is more likely than not
 the Company is required to perform a quantitative impairment test.  Otherwise
 no further analysis is required.  Alternatively
In conducting a qualitative assessment
 the Company analyzes actual and projected growth trends for net sales
 gross margin
 and segment profit for each reporting unit
 as well as historical performance versus plan and the results of prior quantitative tests.  Additionally
 the Company assesses factors that may impact the business's financial results such as macroeconomic conditions and the related impact
 market-related exposures
 plans to market for sale all or a portion of the business
 competitive changes
 new or discontinued product lines
If performed
 the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level.  First
 the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its corresponding carrying value
 including goodwill.  The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using discounted cash flow valuations (Level 3)
 which incorporate assumptions regarding future growth rates
 terminal values
 and discount rates.  The estimates and assumptions used consider historical performance and are consistent with the assumptions used in determining future profit plans for each reporting unit
 which are approved by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors.  If the quantitative assessment results in the carrying value exceeding the fair value of any reporting unit
 the results from the quantitative analysis will be relied upon to determine both the existence and amount of goodwill impairment.  An impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount exceeds its fair value
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019
 the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests and elected to perform a qualitative assessment.  As a result of the qualitative testing during fiscal 2019 and 2018
 and quantitative testing during fiscal 2017
In conducting the annual impairment test for its indefinite-lived intangible assets
 the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (&gt; 50% likelihood) an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.  If the Company concludes this is the case
 a quantitative test for impairment must be performed.  Otherwise
In conducting the qualitative assessment
 the Company analyzes growth rates for historical and projected net sales and the results of prior quantitative tests.  Additionally
If performed
 the quantitative impairment test compares the fair value and carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.  The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is primarily determined on the basis of estimated discounted value using the relief from royalty method (Level 3)
 which incorporates assumptions regarding future sales projections
 discount rates
 and royalty rates.  If the carrying value exceeds fair value
 the indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference.  Even if not required

 The Company has elected to use the corridor approach to recognize expenses related to its defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.  Under the corridor approach
 actuarial gains or losses resulting from experience and changes in assumptions are deferred and amortized over future periods.  For the defined benefit pension plans
 the unrecognized gains and losses are amortized when the net gain or loss exceeds 10.0% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year.  For the other post-retirement plans
 the unrecognized gains and losses are amortized when the net gain or loss exceeds 10.0% of the accumulated pension benefit obligation at the beginning of the year.  For plans with active employees
For plans with only retiree participants
 The Company may be subject to investigations
 legal proceedings
 or claims related to the ongoing operation of its business
 including claims both by and against the Company.  Such proceedings typically involve claims related to product liability
 contract disputes
 wage and hour laws
 employment practices
 or other actions brought by employees
 consumers
 competitors
 or suppliers.  The Company establishes accruals for its potential exposure for claims when losses become probable and reasonably estimable.  Where the Company is able to reasonably estimate a range of potential losses
When calculating foreign currency translation
The Company regularly monitors and evaluates the fair value of its equity investments.  If events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the fair value of these assets has occurred and is other than temporary
 the Company will record a charge in Equity in Earnings of Affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The Company&#8217;s investments do not have a readily determinable fair value as none of them are publicly traded.  The fair values of the Company&#8217;s private equity investments are determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows of each entity.  These cash flow estimates include assumptions on growth rates and future currency exchange rates (Level 3).  The Company did not record an impairment charge on any of its equity investments in fiscal years 2019

.  This topic converges the guidance within U.S. GAAP and international financial reporting standards and supersedes ASC 605
.  The new standard requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The new standard provides enhanced disclosures about revenue
 guidance for transactions which were not previously addressed
 and improves guidance for multiple-element arrangements.  The new guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&#160;15
In October&#160;2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-16
.  The updated guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity asset transfer
 other than transfers of inventory
 when the transfer occurs.  For intra-entity transfers of inventory
 the income tax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party.  The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December&#160;15
 2017
 with early adoption permitted only within the first interim period of a fiscal year.  The guidance is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.  The Company adopted the updated provisions at the beginning of fiscal 2019
 resulting in a reclassification from prepaid tax assets to deferred tax assets.  In addition
 due to the impact of the lower tax rate on deferred tax balances resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act)
In March&#160;2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-07
.  The updated guidance requires an employer to report the service cost component of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit cost in the same line item as other compensation costs.  Other components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit cost must be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside income from operations.  Additionally
 only the service cost component is eligible for capitalization.  This guidance was effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December&#160;15
 2017.  The updated guidance should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of components of net benefit cost and prospectively for the capitalization of the service cost component of net benefit cost.  The Company adopted the updated provisions at the beginning of fiscal 2019.  The Company elected to utilize a practical expedient which allows the Company to use historical amounts disclosed in the Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits footnote as an estimation basis for retrospectively applying the requirements to separately report the other components in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Due to the retrospective adoption
 million of non-service cost components of net periodic benefit costs from Operating Income to Interest and Investment Income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended October 28
 2018 and October 29
In August&#160;2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-12
.  The updated guidance expands an entity&#8217;s ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components and reduce complexity in fair value hedges of interest rate risk.  The guidance eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item.  The guidance also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements and modifies the accounting for components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.  Entities will apply the amendments to cash flow and net investment hedge relationships that exist on the date of adoption using a modified retrospective approach.  The presentation and disclosure requirements apply prospectively.  The updated guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those years.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period.  The Company early adopted the updated guidance at the beginning of fiscal 2019; therefore
In February&#160;2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-02
The updated guidance allows entities to reclassify stranded income tax effects resulting from the Tax Act from Accumulated Other comprehensive income to retained earnings in their consolidated financial statements.  Under the Tax Act
 deferred taxes were adjusted to reflect the reduction of the historical corporate income tax rate to the newly enacted corporate income tax rate
 which left the tax effects on items within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss stranded at an inappropriate tax rate.  The updated guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those years.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim period and should be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Act is recognized.  The Company early adopted the updated provisions at the beginning of fiscal 2019
In July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-09
.  This amendment makes changes to a variety of topics to clarify
 correct errors in
 or make minor improvements to the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC).  The transition and effective date guidance is based on the facts and circumstances of each amendment.  Some of the amendments do not require transition guidance and will be effective upon issuance of ASU 2018-09.  The amendments effective upon issuance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  A majority of the amendments do have transition guidance with effective dates for annual periods beginning after December 15
In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15
&#160; The amendments in the update align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license).  The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 and for interim periods within those fiscal years and is to be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the adoption date.  Early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in any interim period.  The Company early adopted the updated provisions on a prospective basis at the beginning of fiscal 2019.  Subsequent to adoption
&#160;in cloud implementation costs
In February&#160;2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-02
.  The updated guidance requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases with terms of more than 12 months.  Recognition
 measurement
 and presentation of expenses will depend on the classification as a finance or operating lease.  The update also requires expanded quantitative and qualitative disclosures.  Accounting guidance for lessors is largely unchanged.  The requirements of the new standard are effective for fiscal years beginning after December&#160;15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company will adopt the provisions of this new accounting standard at the beginning of fiscal 2020.  For transition purposes
 the Company elected the package of practical expedients to not reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases
 lease classification
 and initial direct costs.  In July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-11
 which provides an optional transition method allowing entities the option to use the effective date as the date of initial application on transition.  The Company elected this transition method
 and as a result
 the Company will not adjust its comparative period financial information or make the new required lease disclosures for periods before the effective date.  The Company elected to not separate lease and non-lease components.  The Company did not elect the hindsight practical expedient.  In connection with the adoption of the new lease accounting standard
 the Company completed scoping reviews and developed business processes
 accounting policies and internal controls.  The Company implemented new lease accounting software to provide a centralized repository and assist in the preparation of the standard's additional reporting requirements.  Based on the assessment to-date
In June&#160;2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-13
.  The update provides guidance on the measurement of credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income.  The amendment replaces the current incurred loss impairment approach with a methodology to reflect expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to explain credit loss estimates.  The updated guidance is to be applied on a modified retrospective approach and is effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December&#160;15
 2019.  Early adoption is permitted for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December&#160;15
 2018
In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-13
The updated guidance requires entities to disclose changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements.  Amendments in this guidance also require disclosure of transfers into and out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy
 purchases and issues of Level 3 assets and liabilities
 and clarify that the measurement uncertainty disclosure is about the uncertainty in measurement as of the reporting date.  The guidance removes requirements to disclose the amounts and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2
 policy for timing between of transfers between levels
 and the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements.  The updated guidance is effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December 15
In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-14
.  The updated guidance requires additional disclosures of weighted-average interest crediting rates for cash balance plans and an explanation of the reasons for significant gains and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation.  Amendments in the guidance also clarify the requirement to disclose the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and fair value of plan assets for plans with PBOs in excess of plan assets.  The same disclosure is needed for the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and fair value of plan assets for plans with ABOs in excess of plan assets.  The guidance removes certain previous disclosure requirements no longer considered cost beneficial.  The amendments are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15
 2020
 with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently assessing the timing and impact of adopting the updated provisions.

As part of the annual valuation process
 the Company reassesses the appropriateness of the inputs used in the valuation models.  The Company establishes the risk-free interest rate using stripped U.S. Treasury yields as of the grant date where the remaining term is approximately the expected life of the option.  The dividend yield is based on the dividend rate approved by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors and the stock price on the grant date.  The expected volatility assumption is based primarily on historical volatility.  As a reasonableness test
 implied volatility from exchange traded options is also examined to validate the volatility range obtained from the historical analysis.  The expected life assumption is based on an analysis of past exercise behavior by option holders.  In performing the valuations for option grants
:  Restricted shares awarded to non-employee directors on February 1 are subject to a restricted period which expires at the date of the Company&#8217;s next annual stockholders meeting.  Newly elected directors receive a prorated award of restricted shares of the Company's common stock

 Right To Reclaim Cash
 Cash Portion




























Right To Reclaim Net Cash Collateral
 Commodity Derivatives [Abstract]





















































































The amount of cash
 securities
 or other assets held by a third-party trustee pursuant to the terms of an agreement which assets are available to be used by beneficiaries to that agreement only within the specific terms thereof and which agreement is expected to terminate more than one year from the balance sheet date (or operating cycle
 if longer) at which time the assets held-in-trust will be released or forfeited.

























































Fair value portion of currency on hand as well as demand deposits with banks or financial institutions. Includes other kinds of accounts that have the general characteristics of demand deposits. Also includes short-term
 highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates.




























Aggregate carrying value as of the balance sheet date of the liabilities for deferred compensation arrangements payable after one year (or the normal operating cycle
 if longer). Represents currently earned compensation under cash arrangements (such as a profit-sharing plan
 rabbi trust
 and employee contract--excluding equity-based arrangements) that is not actually paid until a later date.




























Fair value
 after the effects of master netting arrangements
 of a financial asset or other contract with one or more underlyings
 notional amount or payment provision or both
 and the contract can be net settled by means outside the contract or delivery of an asset
 expected to be settled within one year or normal operating cycle
 if longer. Includes assets not subject to a master netting arrangement and not elected to be offset.

On December 22
 2017
 the United States enacted comprehensive tax legislation into law
 H.R. 1
 commonly referred to as The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act).  Except for certain provisions
 the Tax Act was effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1
 2018.  As a fiscal year U.S. taxpayer
 the majority of the provisions
 such as eliminating the domestic manufacturing deduction
 creating new taxes on certain foreign sourced income
 and introducing new limitations on certain business deductions
 became effective for the Company in fiscal 2019.  The global intangible low taxed income (GILTI) and foreign derived intangible income (FDII) provisions became effective for fiscal 2019 and resulted in an immaterial impact to the Company.  For fiscal 2018
 the most significant impacts included lowering of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate
 remeasuring certain net deferred tax liabilities
 for fiscal 2018
In March 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-05
 from re-measuring the Company's net U.S. deferred tax liabilities
