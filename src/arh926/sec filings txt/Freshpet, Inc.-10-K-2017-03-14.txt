 providing us with broad demographic appeal and allowing us to penetrate multiple classes of retail
 including grocery
 mass
 club
 pet specialty and natural. We have successfully expanded our network of Freshpet Fridges within leading blue-chip retail chains including Albertsons
 BJ&#8217;s
 Costco
 Kroger
 Petco
 PetSmart
 Publix
 Safeway
 Target
 Wal-Mart and Whole Foods. The strength of our business model extends to our customers
 who we believe find that Freshpet grows their pet category sales
 drives higher traffic
 increases shopper frequency and delivers category leading margins. As of December 31
 2016
 Freshpet Fridges were located in over 16
600 stores
 and we believe there is an opportunity to install a Freshpet Fridge in at least 35
000 stores across North America.



 we estimate that dog food
 cat food
 and treats &amp; mixers accounted for retail sales of $13.2 billion
 $7.2 billion
 and $3.6 billion
 respectively. The pet food market has historically been resilient as consumers continue to spend on their pets even during economic downturns. 



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently 79.7 million pet-owning households
 or 65% of total households
 and over 300 million pets in the United States
 according to the American Pet Products Association.
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Packaged Facts
 83% of U.S. pet owners view their pets as members of the family. As pets are increasingly viewed as companions
 friends
 and family members
pet owners are being transformed into &#8220;pet parents&#8221; who spare no expense for their loved ones
 driving premiumization across pet categories. This trend is reflected in food purchasing decisions. Nearly 80% of U.S. pet owners are as concerned about the quality of their pet&#8217;s food as they are about their own
 according to Market researcher Mintel.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Consumers are increasingly purchasing fresh
 natural
 and organic food products. We believe consumers are seeking simple
 fresh and easy to understand food products from brands they trust and made with ingredients that are transparently sourced. 


 resulting in high repeat purchasing behavior. As a result
 we believe that as consumers try fresh
 refrigerated pet food
 they are likely to become repeat users of the product.



 conventional pet food sold as dry kibble or in wet cans has not changed substantially for decades. We believe that the pet food industry has not kept pace with how consumers think about food for their families
 including their pets. As a result
 consumers are searching for higher quality
 less processed food for their dogs and cats&#8212;meals that measure up to today&#8217;s sensibilities of what actually constitutes &#8220;good food.&#8221; Freshpet was specifically designed to address this growing need with affordable offerings accessible to the average consumer.

 healthy food that we do. We cook our fresh
 nutritious pet food with the same care that we would take in preparing human food. Through the Freshpet Foundation
 we support nutritional research in areas of prevention
 care and treatment of diseases in dogs. Since founding Freshpet
 we have donated over two million fresh meals to pets via shelters
 charitable organizations and humane societies. Our team members get paid time off to pursue activities that help pets in their community. We also participate in Random Acts of Kindness to do our part to improve the lives of pets and pet parents. 


 our partners and pet parents. We treat our team members with respect and are committed to helping them develop professionally and personally. We try to be good partners with customers
 distributors and suppliers by conducting business with honesty and transparency. Additionally
 we strive to help pet owners by providing pet parenting resources.

 cat food and dog and cat treats. All Freshpet products are made according to our nutritional philosophy of fresh
 meat-based nutrition and minimal processing. Our proprietary recipes include real
 fresh meat and varying combinations of vitamin-rich vegetables
 leafy greens and anti-oxidant rich fruits
 without the use of preservatives
 additives or artificial ingredients. Our unique product attributes appeal to diverse consumer needs across multiple classes of retail where Freshpet is sold. Consequently
 our brand resonates across a broad cross-section of pet parent demographics.

 packaging and labeling customized by class of retail. Our products are available in multiple forms
 including slice and serve rolls

 refrigerated pet food distributed across North America
 product innovation is core to our strategy. We take a fresh approach to pet food and are not constrained by conventional pet food products
 attributes and production capabilities. We employ a tightly-knit
 creative team of marketing and research and development professionals
 and we consult with outside experts through our Nutrition Council
 which includes leading microbiologists and veterinary nutritionists. Our team often identifies pet parents&#8217; needs by evaluating emerging demand trends in both pet food and human food. Our fully equipped research and development facility located near the Freshpet Kitchens tests small batches of new recipes and tries out new cooking techniques. New products are refined iteratively with the help of consumer panel data to arrive at products that we believe can be commercially successful. 

 refrigerated slice and serve rolls
 and over time have steadily expanded into successful new product forms including bags
 tubs and treats. We also introduced new recipes and ingredients
 such as proteins and grain-free options
 never before seen in pet food that cater to the specific dietary requirements of pets. 

 next door to our Freshpet Kitchens manufacturing plant
 helped us ensure that we remain capable of strong innovation including creating new product platforms to expand the breadth of our fresh offerings. We expect that new product introductions will continue to meaningfully drive growth going forward.

 All of our products are manufactured in the United States. We own and operate what we believe to be the only fresh
 refrigerated pet food manufacturing facility in North America
 the Freshpet Kitchens at Bethlehem
 Pennsylvania. This 100
000 square foot facility was built to human grade food standards and houses four production lines customized to produce fresh
 refrigerated food. In 2016
 approximately 91% of our product volume was manufactured by us.
 Our products are made with natural and fresh ingredients including meat
 vegetables
 fruits
 whole grains
 vitamins and minerals. We use high quality food grade plastic packaging materials. Over 60% of our ingredients are sourced locally from within a 200 mile radius of the Freshpet Kitchens
 97% are from North America and none are sourced from China. We maintain rigorous standards for ingredient quality and safety. By volume
 our largest input
 fresh chicken
 represents approximately 45% of total ingredients. In order to retain operating flexibility and negotiating leverage
 we do not enter into exclusivity agreements or long-term commitments with any of our suppliers. All of our suppliers are well-established companies that have the scale to support our growth. For every ingredient
 we either use multiple suppliers or have identified alternative sources of supply that meet our quality and safety standards. 
 Beginning in 2016
 outbound transportation from our facility is handled through a third-party refrigerated freight broker. We expect to be able to leverage certain distribution costs as volumes grow. We use national and regional distributors to cover the grocery
 mass
 pet specialty and natural retail classes. Our agreements with other distributors are based on regional mutual exclusivity within each region for the fresh refrigerated pet category. 


 consistency and safety from ingredient sourcing to finished product. Our company-owned manufacturing facility allows us to exercise significant control over production. Our quality assurance team includes fourteen professionals with significant experience in pet and human food production. 

 calibrate instruments
 record data and perform corrective actions. Our on-site laboratory has microbial and composition testing capabilities. Quality control approvals are based on a positive release strategy
 wherein a batch can only be shipped when it passes control point record reviews and laboratory testing. At the end of each working day
 a third shift consisting of a cleaning crew sanitizes all equipment that is in contact with food material. Before commencing production the next day
 quality assurance professionals swab equipment to test for potential contaminants. 

 which is the highest standard determined under the Global Food Safety Initiative Benchmarks. We believe our systems and standards for product quality and safety can support our growth and ensure continued success in the market.

 calculated by comparing our total current costs for a refrigerator (including installation and maintenance) to our current margin on net revenues. We believe our attractive value proposition to retailers and pet parents will allow us to continue penetrating store locations of existing and new customers. The Freshpet Fridge provides a highly-visible merchandising platform
 allows us to control how our brand is presented to consumers at point-of-sale and represents a significant point of differentiation from other pet food competitors. 


 digital and public relations to reach consumers through multiple touch points and increase product trials. 

600 branded Freshpet Fridges in prominent locations within blue-chip retailers helps to introduce consumers to our brand and instantly distinguish Freshpet from traditionally merchandised pet food. We have effectively used national TV advertising to drive incremental consumers to try Freshpet products. We expect to realize greater benefits from national TV advertising as we continue to grow the network of Freshpet store locations nationwide. We have also expanded our online presence to better target consumers seeking information on healthy pet food. We reach consumers across multiple digital and social media platforms including websites
 blogs and online reviews
 as well as with tailored messaging on popular digital hubs including Facebook
 Twitter and YouTube.&nbsp;&nbsp;

 in large part
 on our ability to implement our growth strategy of expanding distribution by installing new Freshpet Fridges
 attracting new consumers to our brand and launching new products. Our ability to increase awareness

 financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to implement our growth strategy or if we invest resources in a growth strategy that ultimately proves unsuccessful. 

 and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow or raise capital on acceptable terms to meet our needs. 

 we expect to rely on our cash flow from operations
 our credit facilities
 and other third-party financing. Third-party financing in the future may not
 however
 be available on terms favorable to us
 or at all. Our ability to obtain additional funding will be subject to various factors
 including general market conditions
 our operating performance
 the market&#8217;s perception of our growth potential
 lender sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with other contractual restrictions
 such as financial covenants under our debt documents. 

 our ability to make payments on and to refinance any indebtedness and to fund planned expenditures for our growth plans will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. If our business does not achieve the levels of profitability or generate the amount of cash that we anticipate or if we expand faster than anticipated
 we may need to seek additional debt or equity financing to operate and expand our business. 
We believe that cash and cash equivalents
 expected cash flow from operations and planned borrowing capacity are adequate to fund debt service requirements
 operating lease obligations
 capital expenditures and working capital obligations for the foreseeable future. However
 our ability to continue to meet these requirements and obligations will depend on
 among other things
 our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenue and cash flow from operations and our ability to manage costs and working capital successfully. Additionally
 our cash flow generation ability is subject to general economic
 financial
 competitive
 legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs. Further
 our capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned if
 for example
 our revenues do not reach expected levels or we have to incur unforeseen capital expenditures and make investments to maintain our competitive position. If this is the case
 we may seek alternative financing
 such as selling additional debt or equity securities
 and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on favorable terms
 if at all. Moreover
 if we issue new debt securities
 the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets
 and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations
 including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities
 existing stockholders may experience dilution
 and such new securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. These factors may make the timing
 amount
 terms and conditions 


of additional financings unattractive. Our inability to raise capital could impede our growth or otherwise require us to forego growth opportunities and could materially adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results o


 and the reputation we enjoy with suppliers
 contract manufacturers
 distributors
 customers and consumers. The loss of the services of any of these employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects
 as we may not be able to find and integrate suitable replacements on a timely basis
 if at all. In addition
 any such departure could be viewed in a negative light by investors and analysts
 which may cause the price of our common stock to decline. 

 we may suffer adverse public relations
 need to recall our products and experience product liability claims. 

 including voluntary recalls or withdrawals
 and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to cause injury or illness or if we are alleged to have mislabeled or misbranded our products or otherwise violated governmental regulations. We may also voluntarily recall or withdraw products that we consider below our standards
 whether for taste
 appearance or otherwise
 in order to protect our brand reputation. Consumer or customer concerns (whether justified or not) regarding the safety of our products could adversely affect our business. A product recall or withdrawal could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures
 destruction of product inventory
 and lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time
 which could reduce profitability and cash flow. In addition
 a product recall or withdrawal may require significant management attention. Product recalls
 product liability claims (even if unmerited or unsuccessful)
 or any other events that cause consumers to no longer associate our brands with high quality and safe products may also result in adverse publicity
 hurt the value of our brands
 lead to a decline in consumer confidence in and demand for our products
 and lead to increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies of our operations
 which could have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations. 

 our insurance may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we may incur in connection with product liability claims. For example
 punitive damages are generally not covered by insurance. In addition
 we may not be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance
 obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost
 if at all
 or secure additional coverage (which may result in future product liability claims being uninsured). A product liability judgment against us or our agreement to settle a product liability claim could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures
 which would reduce profitability and cash flow. In addition
 even if product liability claims against us are not successful or are not fully pursued
 these claims could be costly and time-consuming and may require management to spend time defending the claims rather than operating our business. 

 certain actions by a significant customer or financial difficulties of a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations. 
A relatively limited number of customers account for a large percentage of our net sales. During 2016
 ten customers
 who purchase either directly from us or through third-party distributors
 collectively accounted for more than 68% of our net sales. Wal-Mart and Target (which purchase both directly from us and through a distributor) are the only customers who accounted for more than 9% of our net sales during 2016. These percentages may increase if there is consolidation among retailers or if mass merchandisers grow disproportionately to their competition. We expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers; however
 these customers may not continue to purchase our products in the same quantities as they have in the past. Our customers are not contractually obligated to purchase from us. Changes in our customers&#8217; strategies
 including a reduction in the number of brands they carry
 shipping strategies
 a shift of shelf space to or increased emphasis on private label products (including &#8220;store brands&#8221;)
 a reduction in shelf space for pet food items or a reduction in the space allocated for our Freshpet Fridges may adversely affect our sales. Requirements that may be imposed on us by our customers
 such as sustainability
 inventory management or product specification requirements
 may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally
 especially during economic downturns
 our customers may face financial difficulties
 bankruptcy or other business disruptions that may impact their operations and their purchases from us and may affect their ability to pay us for products purchased from us. Customers may grow their inventory in anticipation of a price increase
 or in anticipation of
 or during
 our promotional events
 which typically provide for reduced prices during a specified time or other customer or consumer 


eir practices regarding purchases in excess of consumer consumption
 our sales and results of operations could be adversely impacted in that period. If our sales of products to one or more of our significant customers are reduced
 a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations. 

 in part
 on the sufficiency and effectiveness of our marketing and trade spending programs. 

 due to the highly competitive nature of the businesses in which we compete
 we must execute effective and efficient marketing investments and trade spending programs with respect to our businesses overall to sustain our competitive position in our markets. Marketing investments may be costly. Additionally
 we may
 from time to time
 change our marketing and trade spending strategies
 including the timing
 amount or nature of television advertising and related promotional programs. The sufficiency and effectiveness of our marketing and trade spending practices is important to our ability to retain or improve our market share or margins. If our marketing and trade spending programs are not successful or if we fail to implement sufficient and effective marketing and trade spending programs
 our business
 financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.

 marketing and distribution of pet food products. If consumer demand for our products decreased
 our business would suffer. Sales of pet food products are subject to evolving consumer preferences and changing demographics. A significant shift in consumer demand away from our products or a decline in pet ownership could reduce our sales or the prestige of our brand
 which would harm our business

 the technical capability of our product development staff in developing and testing product prototypes
 including complying with governmental regulations
 and the success of our management and sales team in introducing and marketing new products. Failure to develop and market new products that appeal to consumers could negatively impact our business

 the development and introduction of new products requires substantial research
 development and marketing expenditures
 which we may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance. Efforts to accelerate our innovation may exacerbate risks associated with innovation. If we are unsuccessful in meeting our objectives with respect to new or improved products

 Pennsylvania
 which we believe is North America&#8217;s only fresh
 refrigerated pet food manufacturing facility. Accordingly
 we have limited available manufacturing capacity to meet our quality standards. Due to our continued growth
 we have undertaken a capital expansion project at our Freshpet Kitchens manufacturing facility to expand our plant capacity and increase distribution. A portion of the new equipment was placed into service in July 2016
 with the remaining portion placed into service in October 2016. The expansion increased our production capacity at our Freshpet Kitchens which we estimate will be at least 130% when fully utilized.

 such as a natural disaster or work stoppage
 at our Freshpet Kitchens could significantly limit our manufacturing capacity. 

 which may cause our estimates to be inaccurate
 affecting our ability to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity.

 including increased inspections by the FDA of domestic and foreign food facilities and increased review of food products imported into the United States. In addition
 many states have adopted the Association of American Feed Control Officials&#8217; model pet food regulations or variations thereof
 which generally regulate the information manufacturers provide about pet food. Complying with government regulation can be costly or may otherwise adversely affect our business. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil remedies

 increase the prices of our ingredients
 increase our transportation costs or increase our cost of storing ingredients if harvests are accelerated and processing capacity is unavailable. Additionally
 the growth of crops
 as well as the manufacture and processing of our products
 requires significant amounts of water. Drought or other causes of a reduction of water in aquifers may affect availability of water
 which in turn may adversely affect our results of operations. Competing manufacturers may be affected differently by weather conditions and natural disasters depending on the location of their supplies or operations. If our supply of ingredients is reduced
 we may not be able to find enough supplemental supply sources on favorable terms

These competitors may also prove to be more successful in marketing and selling their products or may be better able to increase prices to reflect cost pressures. We may not compete successfully with these other companies or maintain or grow the distribution of our products. We cannot predict the pricing or promotional activities of our competitors or whether they will have a negative effect on us. Many of our competitors engage in aggressive pricing and promotional activities.

 our profitability and growth depend significantly on our efforts to control our operating costs. Because many of our costs
 such as energy and logistics costs
 packaging costs and ingredient
 commodity and raw product costs
 are affected by factors outside or substantially outside our control
 we generally must seek to control or reduce costs through operating efficiency or other initiatives. If we are not able to identify and complete initiatives designed to control or reduce costs and increase operating efficiency on time or within budget
 our results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition
 if the cost savings initiatives we have implemented to date
 or any future cost-savings initiatives
 do not generate expected cost savings
 our business
 financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 

 commodities
 and ingredients that we require are subject to price increases and shortages that could adversely affect our results of operations. 

 commodities
 and ingredients that we use include meat
 vegetables
 fruits
 carrageenans
 whole grains
 vitamins
 minerals
 packaging and energy (including wind power). Prices for these and other items we use may be volatile
 and we may experience shortages in these items due to factors beyond our control
 such as commodity market fluctuations
 availability of supply
 increased demand (whether for the item we require or for other items
 which in turn impacts the item we require)
 weather conditions
 natural disasters
 currency fluctuations
 governmental regulations (including import restrictions)
 agricultural programs or issues
 energy programs
 labor strikes and the financial health of our suppliers. Input
 commodity
 and ingredient price increases or shortages may result in higher costs or interrupt our production schedules
 each of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Production delays could lead to reduced sales volumes and profitability as well as loss of market share. Higher costs could adversely impact our earnings. For example
 fuel prices affect our transportation costs for both ingredients and finished product. If we are not able to implement our productivity initiatives or increase our product prices to offset price increases of our inputs
 commodities
 and ingredients
 as a result of consumer sensitivity to pricing or otherwise
 or if sales volumes decline due to price increases
 our results of operations could be adversely affected. Our competitors may be better able than we are to implement productivity initiatives or effect price increases or to otherwise pass along cost increases to their customers. Moreover
 if we increase our prices in response to increased costs
 we may need to increase marketing spending
 including trade promotion spending
 in order to retain our market share. Such increased marketing spending may significantly offset the benefits

 for any reason
 we may need to find alternate ingredients for our products

 the cost of alternative sources of the protein-based ingredients we use in our products has from time to time increased significantly and may increase again in the future if additional cases of mad cow disease are found. 

 such as foot-and-mouth disease or highly pathogenic avian influenza
 also known as &#8220;bird flu
&#8221; impacts the availability of the protein-based ingredients we use in our products
 we may be required to locate alternative sources for protein based ingredients. Those sources may not be available to sustain our sales volumes
 may be more costly and may affect the quality and nutritional value of our products. If outbreaks of mad cow disease
 foot-and-mouth disease
 bird flu or any other animal disease or the regulation or publicity resulting therefrom impacts the cost of the protein-based ingredients we use in our products
 or the cost of the alternative protein-based ingredients necessary for our products as compared to our current costs
 we may be required to increase the selling price of our products to avoid margin deterioration. However
 we may not be able to charge higher prices for our products without negatively impacting future sales volumes. 


 from time to time
 a co-packer may experience financial difficulties
 bankruptcy or other business disruptions
 which could disrupt our supply of finished goods or require that we incur additional expense by providing financial accommodations to the co-packer or taking other steps to seek to minimize or avoid supply disruption
 such as establishing a new co-packing arrangement with another provider. During an economic downturn
 our co-packers may be more susceptible to experiencing such financial difficulties
 bankruptcies or other business disruptions. A new co-packing arrangement may not be available on terms as favorable to us as the existing co-packing arrangement
 if at all. 

 including inventory levels

We must continuously monitor our inventory and product mix against forecasted demand or risk having inadequate supplies to meet consumer demand as well as having too much inventory on hand that may reach its expiration date and become unsaleable. If we are unable to manage our supply chain effectively and ensure that our products are available to meet consumer demand
 our operating costs could increase and our profit margins could decrease. 


 shipment tracking and freight dispatch services. Our use of transportation services for shipments is subject to risks
 including increases in fuel prices
 which would increase our shipping costs
 and employee strikes and inclement weather
 which may impact the ability of providers to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs
 including keeping our products adequately refrigerated during shipment. Any such change could cause us to incur costs and expend resources. Moreover
 in the future we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those we receive from the third-party transportation providers that we currently use
 which in turn would increase our costs and thereby adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. 

 our results of operations may be adversely affected. 
We rely in part on price increases to neutralize cost increases and improve the profitability of our business. Our ability to effectively implement price increases or otherwise raise prices for our products can be affected by a number of factors

 we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business. 

 train and retain a sufficient number of employees who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to represent our brand effectively and establish credibility with our business partners and consumers. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of meeting our business needs and expectations
 our business and brand image may be impaired. Any failure to meet our staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates of our employees may adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. 


 our employees may elect to be represented by labor unions in the future. If a significant number of our employees were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements
 it could adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. In addition
 a labor dispute involving some or all of our employees may harm our reputation
 disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues
 and resolution of disputes may increase our costs. 

 we may be subject to various employment-related claims
 such as individual or class actions or government enforcement actions relating to alleged employment discrimination
 employee classification and related withholding
 wage-hour
 labor standards or healthcare and benefit issues. Such actions
 if brought against us and successful in whole or in part
 may affect our ability to compete or could materially adversely affect our business

 customer and consumer demand for our products. In addition
 our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our suppliers
 contract manufacturers
 distributors
 customers
 consumers and creditors may suffer. Consumers have access to lower-priced offerings and
 during economic downturns
 may shift purchases to these lower-priced or other perceived value offerings. Customers may become more conservative in response to these conditions and seek to reduce their inventories. For example
 during the economic downturn from 2007 through 2009
 customers significantly reduced their inventories. Our results of operations depend upon
 among other things
 our ability to maintain and increase sales volume with our existing customers
 to attract new consumers and to provide products that appeal to consumers at prices they are willing and able to pay. Prolonged unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability. 


We are subject to environmental regulation and environmental risks
 which may adversely affect our business. Climate change or concerns regarding climate change may increase environmental regulation and environmental risks. 

 we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent and compliance with them is becoming increasingly expensive. Changes in environmental conditions may result in existing legislation having a greater impact on us. Additionally
 we may be subject to new legislation and regulation in the future. For example
 increasing concern about climate change may result in additional federal and state legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of green-house gas emissions. Compliance with environmental legislation and regulations
 particularly if they are more aggressive than our current sustainability measures used to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency
 may increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations. We cannot predict the extent to which any environmental law or regulation that may be enacted or enforced in the future may affect our operations. The effect of these actions and future actions on the availability and use of pesticides could adversely impact our financial position or results of operations. If the cost of compliance with applicable environmental laws or regulations increases
 our business
 financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.

 the risk of such claims may be exacerbated. Any such claims
 even those without merit
 could (i)&#160;require us to expend significant resources
 (ii)&#160;cause us to cease making or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property
 (iii)&#160;require us to redesign
 reengineer or rebrand our products or packaging
 including our Freshpet Fridges located in over 16
600 retail stores
 (iv)&#160;divert management&#8217;s attention and resources or (v)&#160;require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third-party&#8217;s intellectual property

 our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly. Accordingly
 results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year for any particular future period may decrease. In the future
 operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event
 the price of our common stock would likely decrease.





 2017
 our share price has ranged from a high of $25.92 per share to a low of $5.60 per share. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly
 and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the purchase price. Those fluctuations could be based on various factors in addition to those otherwise described in this report
 including those described under &#8220;&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business and Industry&#8221; and the following: 

















the public&#8217;s reaction to our press releases
 our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC; 

















global
 national or local economic
 legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance; 

















future sales of our common stock by our officers
 directors and significant stockholders; 

















other developments affecting us
 our industry or our competitors. 

 in recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause declines in the market price of our common stock. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business
 financial condition and results of operations
 and those fluctuations could materially reduce our common stock price. 

 we are especially vulnerable to these factors to the extent that they affect our industry or our products. In the past
 securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management&#8217;s attention and resources
 and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation. 

 or the perception that such sales may occur
 could depress our common stock price. 

 2016 we had 33
961
650 shares of common stock outstanding
 and our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 200 million shares of common stock. 

 we may issue additional shares of common stock or other securities if we need to raise additional capital. The number of new shares of our common stock issued in connection with raising additional capital could constitute a material portion of the then outstanding shares of our common stock. Any future sales of our common stock
 or the perception that such sales may occur
 could negatively impact the price of our common stock. 

 our stock price and trading volume could decline. 

 our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly

 a member who currently serves on our Board of Directors is associated with MidOcean. The interests of MidOcean may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock
 and the concentration of control in MidOcean will limit other stockholders&#8217; ability to influence corporate matters. The concentration of ownership and voting power of MidOcean may also delay
 defer or even prevent an acquisition by a third-party or other change of control of our Company and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without their support
 even if such events are in the best interests of our other stockholders. Therefore
 the concentration of voting power that MidOcean has may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. We may also take actions that our other stockholders do not view as beneficial

 Curran v. Freshpet
 Inc. et al
 Docket No. 2:16-cv-02263
 was instituted April 21
 2016 in the United States District Court District of New Jersey against us and certain of our executive officers and directors on behalf of certain purchasers of our common stock. We were served with a copy of the complaint in June 2016. The plaintiffs seek to recover damages for investors under the federal securities laws. The Company believes that the plaintiffs&#8217; allegations are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against the claims. Because the Company is in the early stages of this litigation
 the Company is unable to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss
 if any
 that may result from this matter.

 we are currently involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of our business
 including claims resulting from employment related matters. None of these claims or proceedings
 most of which are covered by insurance
 are expected to have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition
 results of operations or cash flows. However
 a significant increase in the number of these claims or an increase in amounts owing under successful claims could materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition
 results of operations or cash flows.

 the Company was obligated to pay each guarantor a contingent fee equal to 10%&#160;per annum of the amount each guarantor committed to guarantee. Portions of the proceeds from our initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;) and related debt refinancing were used to repay the borrowings under the $62.5 Million Revolver
 relieving us of our future fees on the debt guarantee. Concurrently
 with the closing of the IPO
 the outstanding guarantee fees were converted into shares of our Series C Preferred Stock
 par value $0.001 (the &#8220;Series C Preferred Stock&#8221;)
 which were then converted into common stock. See our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for additional information. 








 on a quarterly basis. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock were entitled to dividends at a rate of 8%&#160;per annum of the Series C Preferred Stock original issue price. Once the Series C Preferred Stock was converted to common stock
 the accrued dividends that had not been declared by the Board of Directors were relinquished. 







 the Series C Preferred Stock were fair valued utilizing the Common Stock share price at the date of conversion. The difference between fair value and book value was recorded as net loss attributable to common stockholders.








 Adjusted EBITDA

 and Adjusted SG&amp;A Expenses are not financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles

 where they are reconciled to the closest GAAP measure.























 including those set forth in &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report
 as well as the information presented under &#8220;Selected Financial Data.&#8221; 


 fresh food to our dogs and cats. We were inspired by the rapidly growing view among pet owners that their dogs and cats are a part of their family
 leading them to demand healthier pet food choices. Since inception of the company in 2006
 we have created a comprehensive business model to deliver wholesome pet food that pet parents can trust
 and in the process we believe we have become one of the fastest growing pet food companies in North America. Our business model is difficult for others to replicate and we see significant opportunity for future growth by leveraging the unique elements of our business
 including our brand
 our product know-how
 our Freshpet Kitchens
 our refrigerated distribution
 our Freshpet Fridge and our culture. 


 we have undertaken a capital expansion project at our Freshpet Kitchens manufacturing facility to expand our plant capacity and increase distribution. Since 2015
 we have invested approximately $35.2 million in capital expenditures
 with $17.6 million recorded during each of 2016 and 2015. A portion of the new equipment was placed in service in July 2016
 with the remaining portion placed into service in October 2016
 which resulted in incremental depreciation expense of approximately $1.6 million in the year ended December 31
 2016. In order to fund the expansion
 we borrowed $10.0 million under our Credit Facilities and repaid $3.0 million

 we have opened our Innovation Center located next door to Freshpet Kitchens. We expect this facility to provide additional capabilities in innovation and research &amp; development.

 we recently expanded our business on a test basis to two retailers in the United Kingdom
 where our products are selling in 63 stores.


 who purchase either directly from us or through third-party distributors. Our products are sold to consumers through a fast-growing network of company-owned branded refrigerators
 known as Freshpet Fridges
 located in our customers&#8217; stores. We continue to roll out Freshpet Fridges across leading retailers across North America and have installed Freshpet Fridges in over 16
600 retail stores as of December&#160;31
 2016. All of our products are sold under the Freshpet brand name
 with ingredients
 packaging and labeling customized by class of retail. Sales are recorded net of discounts
 slotting
 returns and promotional allowances. 









Increasing sales velocity from the average Freshpet Fridge due to increasing awareness
 trial and adoption of Freshpet products. Our investments in marketing and advertising help to drive awareness and trial at each point of sale. 








Increased penetration of Freshpet Fridge locations in major classes of retail
 including grocery
 mass
 club
 pet specialty and natural. The impact of new Freshpet Fridge installations on our net sales varies by retail class and depends on numerous factors including store traffic
 refrigerator size
 placement within the store
 and proximity to other stores that carry our products. 








Consumer trends including growing pet ownership
 pet humanization and a focus on health and wellness. 

 we will continue to penetrate the pet food marketplace and increase our share of the pet food category.




 which include the costs of product manufacturing
 product ingredients
 packaging materials
 spoils
 and inbound freight. As discussed above
 we have also undertaken a capital expansion project at our Freshpet Kitchens facility that we believe further increased our production capacity which we estimate will be at least 130% when fully utilized. Over time
 growing capacity utilization of our new facility will allow us to leverage fixed costs and thereby expand our gross profit margins.


 General and Administrative Expenses

 general and administrative expenses consist of the following: 
Prior to the second quarter of 2016
 outbound freight from our Freshpet Kitchens was managed by a national third-party refrigerated and frozen human food manufacturer. During the second quarter
 we transitioned to a new third-party logistics provider. Through our new third-party logistics provider&#8217;s infrastructure
 we realized cost efficiencies in logistics during the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally
 we sell through third-party distributors for the grocery
 mass
 club
 pet specialty and natural classes in the United States
 Canada
 and on a test basis in the United Kingdom.
 Our marketing and advertising expenses primarily consist of national television media
 digital marketing
 social media
 and grass roots marketing to drive brand awareness. These expenses may vary from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our marketing and advertising campaigns.



. We account for all share-based compensation payments issued to employees
 directors
 and non-employees using a fair value method. Accordingly
 share-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date. We recognize compensation expense for the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the period during which the recipient renders the required services to us using the straight-line single option method. 
 Other general and administrative costs include non-plant personnel salaries and benefits
 as well as corporate general&#160;&amp; administrative costs. 

 general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales have continued to decrease from 81.3% in 2012
 62.7% in 2013
 55.7% in 2014
 50.2% in 2015 and to 47.0% in 2016. We expect our selling
 general
 and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of net sales as we continue to expand our distribution footprint and grow our net sales.


 2016
 which expire between 2025 and 2036. We may be subject to certain limitations in our annual utilization of net operating loss carry forwards to off-set future taxable income pursuant to Section&#160;382 of the Internal Revenue Code
 which could result in NOLs expiring unused. At December 31
 2016
 we had approximately $132.4 million of State NOLs
 which expire between 2016 and 2036. At December 31
 2016
 we had a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets as the realization of such assets was not considered more likely than not.

 or 15%
 to $133.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31
 2016 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The $16.9 million increase in net sales was driven by growth in the Grocery
 Mass

 incremental operating expenses of $3.6 million
 lower outbound freight costs of $0.2 million due to optimizations realized with our new logistics provider
 lower advertising expenses of $0.9 million
 and lower research &amp; development costs of $0.8 million. The increased operating expenses were primarily due to new hires and increased employee benefit costs
 which include variable compensation.

 or 29%
 to $54.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31
 2015 as compared to the same period in the prior year.&#160;&#160;The increase in gross profit was partially offset by manufacturing throughput constraints associated with new product innovation
 as well as start-up costs from the implementation of new manufacturing processes.

 2015
 was a decrease of 162 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year
 primarily related to 237 basis points due to operational inefficiencies associated with product innovation
 partially offset by 62 basis points due to leverage of depreciation expense with higher volumes in 2015 and 13 basis points due to non-capitalizable start-up costs associated with the Freshpet Kitchens plant startup in 2014.

 higher advertising expenses of $2.1 million
 higher share-based compensation expense of $1.9 million
 secondary fees of $0.6 million
 research and development costs of $0.2 million and incremental operating expenses of $4.3 million
 which were partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense of $1.0 million.&#160;The increased operating expenses were primarily due to costs associated with being a public company
 new hires
 and increased refrigerator repairs due to our growing Freshpet Fridge network.

 associated with indebtedness;












 which are non-cash charges
 although the assets being depreciated and amortized will likely have to be replaced in the future
 nor any cash requirements for such replacements; and















 Adjusted EBITDA excludes (i) non-cash stock based compensation expense
 which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package
 and (ii) certain costs essential to our sales growth and strategy
 including an allowance for marketing expenses for each new store added to our network and non-capitalizable freight costs associated with Freshpet Fridge replacements. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations. Other companies in our industry may calculate the non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do
 limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

Represents fees paid to certain stockholders for acting as guarantors for a portion of our prior payment obligations under the $62.5 Million Revolver. Pursuant to a Fee and Reimbursement Agreement
 the Company was obligated to pay each guarantor a contingent fee equal to 10% per annum of the amount each guarantor committed to guarantee. Portions of the proceeds from our IPO and related debt refinancing were used to repay the borrowings under the $62.5 Million Revolver
 relieving us of our future fees on the debt guarantee. Concurrently
 with the closing of the IPO
 the outstanding guarantee fees were converted into shares of our Series C Preferred Stock
 which were then converted into common stock. See our consolidated financial statements and the notes for additional information.

 we expect to rely on our current and future cash flow from operations
 and our current available borrowing capacity. Our ability to obtain additional funding will be subject to various factors
 including general market conditions
 our operating performance
 the market&#8217;s perception of our growth potential
 lender sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with other contractual restrictions
 such as financial covenants under our debt agreements.


Additionally
 our ability to make payments on
 and to refinance
rate cash in the future. If our business does not achieve the levels of profitability or generate the amount of cash that we anticipate or if we expand faster than anticipated
 we may need to seek additional debt or equity financing to operate and expand o

 expected cash flow from operations and planned borrowing capacity are adequate to fund debt service requirements
 operating lease obligations
 capital expenditures and working capital obligations for the foreseeable future. However
 our ability to continue to meet these requirements and obligations will depend on
 among other things
 our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenue and cash flow from operations and our ability to manage costs and working capital successfully. Additionally
 our cash flow generation ability is subject to general economic
 financial
 competitive
 legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs. Further
 our capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned if
 for example
 our revenues do not reach expected levels or we have to incur unforeseen capital expenditures and make investments to maintain our competitive position. If this is the case
 we may seek alternative financing
 such as selling additional debt or equity securities
 and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on favorable terms
 if at all. Moreover
 if we issue new debt securities
 the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets
 and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations
 including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities
 existing stockholders may experience dilution
 and such new securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. These factors may make the timing
 amount
 terms and conditions of additional financings unattractive. Our inability to raise capital could impede our growth or otherwise require us to forego growth opportunities and could materially adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.

 2016 compared to $16.2 million at December 31
 2015 is primarily related to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents as a result of $30.0 million of capital expenditures
 partially offset by cash flows from operations of $12.8 million
 which includes the increase in working capital assets and liabilities of $1.4 million
 and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $2.8 million.

 2016
 our capital resources consisted primarily of $3.9 million cash on hand and $30.0 million available under our Credit Facilities. Our primary cash needs are for ingredients
 purchases and operating expenses
 marketing expenses and capital expenditures to procure Freshpet Fridges and expand and improve our manufacturing plant to support our net sales growth. The Company invested $17.6 million in the Freshpet Kitchens expansion project during 2016. A portion of the new equipment was placed in service in July 2016
 with the remaining portion placed into service in October 2016. With the wind down of the expansion project
 we expect to run the business and payback short-term borrowings with cash flow from operations. In order to fund the expansion
 we borrowed $10.0 million under our Credit Facilities and repaid $3.0 million by the end of 2016. We expect to repay the remainder of this indebtedness by the end of 2017.

 2016
 net cash provided by operating activities was $12.8 million
 primarily consisting of adjusted net income of $11.2 million
 which excludes $14.3 million of non-cash items primarily relating to $4.2 million of share-based compensation and $9.9 million of depreciation and amortization
 and proceeds from an increase in operating assets and liabilities of $1.6 million. The increase in assets of $1.5 million is primarily related to growth in accounts receivable
 which is primarily due to growth in net sales and an increase in the number of stores with a Freshpet fridge. The increase in liabilities of $3.1 million was due to timing of payments and accrued leadership transition costs.

 net cash provided by operating activities was $6.7 million
 which consisted of net income
 adjusted for non-cash items
 of $3.7 million
 and a $0.7 million decrease related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. The change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable of $1.7 and a decrease in accrued expenses of $0.7 million
 offset by a decrease in inventories of $0.6 million
 decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1.1 million
 and an increase in accounts payable of $0.2 million. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to growth in net sales. The change in remaining operating accounts is due to timing.

 net cash used in operating activities was $8.0 million
 which consisted of a net loss
 adjusted for non-cash items
 of $1.9 million and $6.1 million decrease related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. The change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable of $1.9 million
 an increase in inventories of $1.7 million
 an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1.1 million
 and a decrease of accounts payable of $1.6 million. The increase in accounts receivable and inventory is primarily due to a 37.4% growth in net sales. The change in accounts payable and prepaid and other current assets is due to timing of payments.


 2016 relates primarily to capital expenditures related to the Freshpet Kitchens of $20.8 million (including the Freshpet Kitchens expansion of $17.6 million and recurring capital expenditures of $3.2 million)
 investments in fridges as well as other miscellaneous capital spend of $9.1 million
 offset by maturities of short-term investments of $3.2 million.

 2015 relates primarily to capital expenditures related to the Freshpet Kitchens of $19.1 million (including the Freshpet Kitchens expansion of $17.6 million and recurring capital expenditures of $1.5 million)

 2014
 the Company entered into senior secured credit facilities (the &#8220;Debt Refinancing&#8221;) comprised of a 5-year $18.0 million term facility (the &#8220;Term Facility&#8221;)
 a 3-year $10.0 million revolving facility (the &#8220;Revolving Facility&#8221;) and a $12.0 million additional term loan commitment earmarked primarily for capital expenditures (the &#8220;Capex Commitments&#8221; and together with the Term Facility and Revolving Facility
 the &#8220;Credit Facilities&#8221; and such loan agreement
 the &#8220;Loan Agreement&#8221;). 

 2014
 the Company modified the terms of the $40.0 million Credit Facilities. The $18.0 million Term Facility was repaid and extinguished
 the 3-year $10.0 million Revolving Facility remained unchanged
 and the $12.0 million Capex Commitments was increased to $30.0 million. Amounts borrowed under the Capex Commitments reduce the $30.0 million available such that the borrowed funds are no longer available after repayment. Any drawn Capex Commitments will mature on the fifth anniversary of the execution of the Loan Agreement
 and undrawn Capex Commitments will expire on the third anniversary of the execution of the Loan Agreement. Under the terms of the Loan Agreement
 the commitments for the $10.0 million Revolving Facility may be increased up to $20.0 million subject to certain conditions. 

 either at a base rate or at LIBOR
 in each case
 plus an applicable margin. The initial applicable margin is 3.75% for base rate loans and 4.75% for LIBOR loans. Thereafter
 subject to our leverage ratio
 the applicable base rate margin will vary from 2.75% and 3.75% and the applicable LIBOR rate margin will vary from 3.75% and 4.75%. The Credit Facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets. The Loan Agreement provides for the maintenance of various covenants
 including financial covenants. The Loan Agreement includes events of default that are usual for facilities and transactions of this type. 

 2016
 the Company borrowed $10.0 million and repaid $3.0 million from the Capex Commitments
 and had $30.0 million available under the Credit Facilities as of December 31
 2016. The Company was in compliance with all covenants in the Loan Agreement and had $7.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facilities as of December 31
 2016. There was no outstanding debt as of December 31
 2015. There was less than $0.1 million of accrued interest as of December 31
 2016 and no accrued interest as of December 31
 2015. Interest expense and fees totaled $0.7 million
 $0.5 million
 and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31

 which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
 or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 as well as the revenue and expenses incurred during the reported periods. On an ongoing basis
 we evaluate our estimates and judgments
 including those related to accrued expenses and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

 we believe that the following critical accounting policies are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.

 and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period.

 as these policies related to the more significant areas involving management&#8217;s judgments and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results
 as determined at a later date
 could differ from those estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimate and the actual results
 our future financial statement presentation
 financial condition
 results of operations and cash flows will be affected.



 plant and equipment are recorded at cost. We provide for depreciation on the straight-line method by charges to income at rates based upon estimated recovery periods of 7 years for furniture and office equipment
 5 years for automotive equipment
 9 years for refrigeration equipment
 5 to 10 years for machinery and equipment
 and 15 to 39 years for building and improvements. Capitalized cost includes the costs incurred to bring the property
 plant and equipment to the condition and location necessary for its intended use
 which includes any necessary delivery
 electrical and installation cost for equipment. Maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful life of the assets over two years are charged to expense as incurred. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful lives on the straight-line method (without consideration of option renewal terms).

 an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to their fair value less estimated costs to sell. Estimating future cash flows and calculating fair value of assets requires significant estimates and assumptions by management. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties
 and the measurement of the recoverability of the cost of a potentially impaired asset is dependent on the accuracy of the assumptions used in making the estimates and how these estimates compare to our future operating performance. If the carrying amount is not fully recoverable
 an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carry amount to fair value
 and is charged to expense in the period of impairment.


 2016
 we had federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $160.7 million
 which expire at various dates between 2025 and 2036. We may be subject to the net operating loss utilization provisions of Section&#160;382 of the Code. The effect of an ownership change would be the imposition of an annual limitation on the use of NOL carryforwards attributable to periods before the change. The amount of the annual limitation depends upon our value immediately before the ownership change
 changes to our capital during a specified period prior to the change
 and the federal published interest rate. Although we have not completed a Code Section&#160;382 analysis
 if we were to undergo an ownership change it is likely that the utilization of the NOLs will be substantially limited.

 the deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31
 2016 and 2015
 we determined that a valuation allowance of 100% is deemed appropriate.
&#8212;Revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon shipment to the customers
 at which point title and risk of loss is transferred and the selling price is fixed or determinable. This completes the revenue-earning process specifically that an arrangement exists

 ownership has transferred

 consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances and merchandising funds and from time-to-time
 consumer coupons are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of estimated trade incentive spending
 which is recognized as incurred at the time of sale. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are included as accrued expense in the consolidated balance sheet. Coupon redemption costs are also recognized as reduction to calculate net sales when the coupons are issued. Estimates of trade promotion expense and coupon redemption costs are based upon programs offered
 timing of those offers
 estimated redemption/usage rates from historical performance
 management&#8217;s experience and current economic trends.
We account for all share-based compensation payments issued to employees
 directors
 and nonemployees using a fair value method. Accordingly
 share-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the period during which the recipient renders the required services to us using the straight-line single option method. 

 Assumptions and Methodologies Used in Determining Fair Value

 
 which we refer to as ASC 718. Determining the amount of share-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock options as of their grant date. For service period and performance based options we recognize share-based compensation expense ratably over the requisite service
 which is the vesting period of the award. For exit event options we recognize share-based compensation expense upon the occurrence of an exit event as defined in the option grant agreement. Calculating the fair value of share-based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions.

 the expected term of our stock options
 the risk free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. We utilized our historical stock price as an indicator of volatility for all grants prior to 2013. The grants during 2014 all occurred while the Company was publicly traded.&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent to the IPO
 we no longer deemed it appropriate to use historical volatility as it was not representative of the Company&#8217;s stock on the public market.&nbsp;&nbsp;As such expected volatility that was utilized was based upon the volatility of a group of similar entities
 referred to as &#8220;guideline&#8221; companies. As Freshpet has more historical data based on more time as a public company
 the historical volatility of Freshpet becomes a more significant input.

 Share-Based Payment
 to calculate the expected term of stock option grants to employees as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term of stock options granted to employees. We utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no current intention to pay cash dividends. The risk-free interest rate used for each grant is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life. The weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model were as follows for the years ended December&#160;31

 2016
 we adopted ASU No. 2016-09
 &#8220;Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting
&#8221; under which we have elected to account for forfeitures when they occur rather than estimating the number of awards that are expected to vest. The impact on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss was not material.


Share-based compensation cost was $4.2 million
 $4.0 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31
 2016
 2015
 and 2014
 respectively. 

 2015
 the achievement of the vesting criteria related to the performance-based awards under the 2010 and 2014 plans (which were modified and granted
 respectively
 in November 2014) was no longer probable.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result
 the Company reversed $2.6 million of compensation expenses related to performance-based awards during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31
 2015. 

 2016
 the achievement of the vesting criteria related to the tranche of these awards which would have vested on December 31
 2016 was no longer probable.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result
 the Company reversed $0.1 million of compensation expenses related to performance-based awards during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31
 2016. 

 2016
 unrecognized compensation costs related to performance-based awards for which the achievement of the vesting criteria is considered probable as of December 31
 2016 have performance target dates ranging from December 31
 2017 through December 31
 2020.

 stock-based compensation expense in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past. If there is a difference between the assumptions used in determining stock-based compensation expense and the actual factors that become known over time
 we may change the input factors used in determining stock-based compensation expense for future grants. These changes
 if any
 may materially impact our results of operations in the period such changes are made. We expect to continue to grant stock options in the future
 and to the extent that we do
 our actual stock-based compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase.
&#8212;Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. The accounting guidance specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources
 while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).


















Level 2&#8212;Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability
 either directly or indirectly (e.g. quoted prices of similar assets or liabilities in active markets
 or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active). Level 2 includes financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies.








Level 3&#8212;Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Financial instruments are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models
 discounted cash flows or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.

 other receivables
 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments. The warrant liability is recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss.



 the FASB issued ASU 2015-03
 &#8220;Interest&#8212;Imputation of Interest
&#8221; which requires that debt issuance cost be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of debt liability
 consistent with debt discounts or premiums. This new guidance was adopted beginning January 1
 2016 and did not impact the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements other than presentation.


November 2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-17
 &#8220;Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes
anuary 1
 2016. The effects of ASU 2015-17 will change retrospectively how deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified within the balance sheet and notes thereto. Due to the Company&#8217;s full valuation allowance
 deferred tax assets and liabilities hav

 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09
 &#8220;Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting
&#8221; which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions including the income tax consequences
 classification of awards as either equity or liabilities
 and classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company elected to early adopt this amendment in the second quarter of 2016. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures when they occur rather than estimating the number of awards that are expected to vest. The impact on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss was not material. The amendments related to excess tax benefits are not material due to the Company&#8217;s net operating losses.


 the Financing Accounting Standard Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued ASU No. 2014-09
 &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&#8221;
 which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In connection with this ASU
 the FASB also issued ASU No. 2016-10 regarding identification of performance obligations and licensing considerations
 ASU No. 2016-12 regarding narrow scope improvements and practical expedients
 and ASU No. 2016-08 which clarifies the implementation of guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In August 2015
 the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 to fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017
 with early adoption permitted only for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2016. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. 

 2018 and has not yet selected a transition method.

 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11
 &#8220;Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory
&#8221; which requires that an entity carry its inventory at lower of cost or net realizable value (which replaces &#8220;lower of cost or market&#8221;) if the first-in first-out (&#8220;FIFO&#8221;) or average cost methods are used. This new guidance is effective for the Company&#8217;s fiscal year beginning after December 15
 2016. ASU No. 2015-11 is not expected to have any impact upon adoption
 although it could have impact in the future periods will depend on future valuation of the Company&#8217;s inventory.


 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases
&#8221; which requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is assessing the impact of ASU No. 2016-02 on its corporate office lease
 and upon adoption of this guidance
 expects to record the lease on its consolidated balance sheet in accordance with ASU No. 2016-02.


 FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15
 &#8220;Statement of Cash Flows&#8221;
 which clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows
 such as proceeds from insurance claims. The new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company accounts for all applicable cash flows in accordance with this guidance and does not expect the standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and financial statement disclosures.

 the Company purchased a building and 6.5 acres of land adjacent to the Company&#8217;s manufacturing facility in Bethlehem
 Pennsylvania. The assets have been recorded in Building
 Land and Improvements at a cost of approximately $5.0 million
 of which approximately $2.1 million was the value of the land
 with the remaining portion representing the value of the building.

 the Company has undertaken a capital expansion project at its Freshpet Kitchens manufacturing facility to expand the plant capacity and increase distribution. Since 2015
 the Company invested approximately $35.2 million in capital expenditures related to this project
 with $17.6 million recorded during each of 2016 and 2015. A portion of the new equipment was placed into service in July 2016
 with the remaining portion placed into service in October 2016
 which resulted in incremental depreciation expense of approximately $1.6 million in the year ended December 31
 2016. In order to fund the expansion
 we borrowed $10.0 million under our Credit Facilities and repaid $3.0 million by the end of 2016. We expect to repay the remainder of this indebtedness by the end of 2017.

 the Company considers all relevant positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The realization of the gross deferred tax assets is dependent on several factors
 including the generation of sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the Company&#8217;s deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The Company has experienced taxable losses from inception. As such
 there is a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets as of December&#160;31

 a cash incentive will be earned by the vendor upon achievement of certain performance goals that must be reached by the end of the contract term

 the Company entered into a Fee and Reimbursement Agreement with certain stockholders who were also guarantors of the note. That agreement stipulated that the Company would pay each guarantor a contingent fee equal to 10%&#160;per annum of the amount that each guarantor had committed to guarantee. The payment was to be made in the form of newly issued shares of Series C Preferred Stock at the price of $5.25 per share. The fee accrued only from and after the date that the Guarantor entered into the Guarantee
 and if at any time any Guarantor&#8217;s obligation was terminated in full or in part
 the Fee would continue to accrue only with respect to the amount
 if any of such Guarantor&#8217;s remaining commitment under the Credit Agreement. The fee was contingent in that it would become due and payable only if all principal and interest under the credit agreement had been repaid and a Change of Control had occurred. A Change of Control was defined as any sale
 merger
 consolidation
 share exchange
 business combination
 equity issuance

The risk-free interest rates was based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a period consistent with the expected contractual life.

&#8221; as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act
 that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company&#8217;s management
 including its principal executive and principal financial officers
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

 with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
 evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31
 2016. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31
 2016
 our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
 as of such date
 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 



 2016
 using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992). This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on this assessment
 management concluded that as of December 31
 2016
 the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting was effective.


 2016 that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.


 including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However
 our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system
 no matter how well conceived and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further
 the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
 and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
 have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty
 and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally
 controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons
 by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
 and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time
 controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system
 misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 Inc. (hereafter referred to as &amp;#8220;Freshpet&amp;#8221; or the &amp;#8220;Company&amp;#8221;)
 a Delaware corporation
 manufactures and markets natural fresh
 refrigerated meals and treats for dogs and cats. The Company&amp;#8217;s products are distributed throughout the United States
 Canada and an international test market into major retail classes including Grocery and Mass (which includes club) as well as Pet specialty and Natural retail. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Principles of Consolidation&lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt; &amp;#8211; The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (&amp;#8220;U.S. GAAP&amp;#8221;). The financial statements include the accounts of the Company as well as the Company&amp;#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Segments&lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt; &amp;#8211; The Company operates as a single operating segment reporting to its chief operating decision maker. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Estimates and Uncertainties&lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt; &amp;#8211; The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
 as determined at a later date
 could differ from those estimates. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Cash and Cash Equivalents&lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt; &amp;#8211; The Company at times considers money market funds and all other highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold;;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Short-Term Investments &lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt;&amp;#8211;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt;The Company at times holds interest-bearing certificates of deposits with financial institutions with maturities ranging from three months to one year. Certificates of deposit are classified as short-term investments and interest is recorded as other expenses
 net. Historically
 interest income has not been material. The Company will continue to monitor interest income and will disclose separately if significant. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Accounts Receivable&lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt; &amp;#8211; The Company records trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts. On a periodic basis
 the Company evaluates its accounts receivable and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its history of write-offs and collections and current credit conditions. Accounts receivable are written off when management deems them to be uncollectible. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Inventories&lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt; &amp;#8211; Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market
 using the first-in
 first-out method. When necessary
 the Company provides allowances to adjust the carrying value of its inventories to the lower of cost or net realizable value
 including any costs to sell or dispose and consideration for obsolescence

 Plant and Equipment&lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt; &amp;#8211; Property
 plant and equipment are recorded at cost. The Company provides for depreciation on the straight-line method by charges to income at rates based upon estimated recovery periods of 7 years for furniture and office equipment
 5 years for automotive equipment
 9 years for refrigeration equipment
 5 to 10 years for machinery and equipment
 and 15 to 39 years for building and improvements. Capitalized cost includes the costs incurred to bring the property
 plant and equipment to the condition and location necessary for its intended use
 which includes any necessary delivery
 electrical and installation cost for equipment. Maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful life of the assets over two years are charged to expense as incurred. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful lives on the straight-line method. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Long-Lived Assets&lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt; &amp;#8211; The Company evaluates all long-lived assets for impairment. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future net cash flows
 an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to their fair value less estimated costs to sell. Estimating future cash flows and calculating fair value of assets requires significant estimates and assumptions by management. If the carrying amount is not fully recoverable
 an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carry amount to fair value
 and is charged to expense in the period of impairment. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Income Taxes &lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt;&amp;#8211; The Company provides for deferred income taxes for temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting
 principally net operating loss carryforwards
 depreciation
 and share-based compensation. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;A valuation allowance is appropriate when management believes it is more likely than not
 the deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31
 2016
 and 2015
 the Company determined that a valuation allowance of 100% is appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;

 which is estimated based upon the Company&amp;#8217;s historical performance

 consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances and merchandising funds
 and consumer coupons are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of estimated trade incentive spending
 which is recognized as incurred at the time of sale. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are included as accrued expense in the consolidated balance sheet. Coupon redemption costs are also recognized as reductions of net sales when the coupons are issued. Estimates of trade promotion expense and coupon redemption costs are based upon programs offered

Share-based compensation expense recognized in the statement of operations included compensation expense for share-based payment awards granted subsequent to December 31
 2006
 based on the grant date fair value estimated. Share awards are amortized under the straight-line method over the requisite service period of the entire award. Upon the adoption of ASU 2016-09
 the Company no longer estimates expected forfeitures but accounts for forfeitures as they occur.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;The Company determines the fair value of the stock options granted as either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued
 whichever is more reliably measurable. &lt;/p&gt;

Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources
 while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: &lt;/p&gt;

 the FASB issued ASU 2015-03
 &amp;#8220;Interest&amp;#8212;Imputation of Interest
&amp;#8221; which requires that debt issuance cost be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of debt liability
 consistent with debt discounts or premiums. This new guidance was adopted beginning January 1
 2016 and did not impact the Company&amp;#8217;s consolidated financial statements other than presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;color:#000000;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;In November 2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-17
 &amp;#8220;Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes
&amp;#8221; which requires entities with a classified balance sheet to present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The new guidance was adopted beginning January 1
 2016. The effects of ASU 2015-17 will change retrospectively how deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified within the balance sheet and notes thereto. Due to the Company&amp;#8217;s full valuation allowance
 deferred tax assets and liabilities have not been disclosed within the consolidated balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;color:#000000;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;In March 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09
 &amp;#8220;Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting
&amp;#8221; which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions including the income tax consequences
 classification of awards as either equity or liabilities
 and classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company elected to early adopt this amendment in the second quarter of 2016. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures when they occur rather than estimating the number of awards that are expected to vest. The impact on the Company&amp;#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss was not material. The amendments related to excess tax benefits are not material due to the Company&amp;#8217;s net operating losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;color:#000000;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Not Yet Adopted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;color:#000000;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;In May 2014
 the Financing Accounting Standard Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) issued ASU No. 2014-09
 &amp;#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&amp;#8221;
 which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In connection with this ASU
 the FASB also issued ASU No. 2016-10 regarding identification of performance obligations and licensing considerations
 ASU No. 2016-12 regarding narrow scope improvements and practical expedients
 and ASU No. 2016-08 which clarifies the implementation of guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In August 2015
 the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 to fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017
 with early adoption permitted only for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2016. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;color:#000000;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;The Company is currently utilizing a comprehensive approach to assess the impact of this guidance by reviewing current accounting policies to identify the potential impact of the new requirements on its revenue contracts. The Company does not currently expect this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company currently expects to adopt the new guidance beginning in the fiscal year ended December 31
 2018 and has not yet selected a transition method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;color:#000000;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;In July 2015
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11
 &amp;#8220;Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory
&amp;#8221; which requires that an entity carry its inventory at lower of cost or net realizable value (which replaces &amp;#8220;lower of cost or market&amp;#8221;) if the first-in first-out (&amp;#8220;FIFO&amp;#8221;) or average cost methods are used. This new guidance is effective for the Company&amp;#8217;s fiscal year beginning after December 15
 2016. ASU No. 2015-11 is not expected to have impact upon adoption
 but could have an impact in future periods depending upon the future valuation of the Company&amp;#8217;s inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-family:Times New Roman;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is assessing the impact of ASU No. 2016-02 on its corporate office lease
 and upon adoption of this guidance
 expects to record the lease on its consolidated balance sheet in accordance with ASU No. 2016-02.


 FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15
 &#8220;Statement of Cash Flows&#8221;
 which clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows
 such as proceeds from insurance claims. The new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company accounts for all applicable cash flows in accordance with this guidance and does not expect the standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and financial statement disclosures.

 Pennsylvania. The assets have been recorded in Building
 Land and Improvements at a cost of approximately $5.0 million
 of which approximately $2.1 million was the value of the land
 with the remaining portion representing the value of the building.

 the Company has undertaken a capital expansion project at its Freshpet Kitchens manufacturing facility to expand the plant capacity and increase distribution. Since 2015
 the Company invested approximately $35.2 million in capital expenditures related to this project
 with $17.6 million recorded during each of 2016 and 2015. A portion of the new equipment was placed into service in July 2016
 with the remaining portion placed into service in October 2016
 which resulted in incremental depreciation expense of approximately $1.6 million in the year ended December 31
 2016. In order to fund the expansion
 we borrowed $10.0 million under our Credit Facilities and repaid $3.0 million by the end of 2016. We expect to repay the remainder of this indebtedness by the end of 2017.

 the Company considers all relevant positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The realization of the gross deferred tax assets is dependent on several factors

The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the Company&#8217;s deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The Company has experienced taxable losses from inception. As such

&#8211; In November 2015
 Freshpet entered into an incentive agreement with a vendor. Under the terms of the agreement
 a cash incentive will be earned by the vendor upon achievement of certain performance goals that must be reached by the end of the contract term
 which expires on November 30
 2017. The incentive payout is based on the fair value of the Company&#8217;s common stock price as of the achievement date specified within the contract. As of December 31
 2016
 the Company does not believe it is probable that the vendor will reach the performance goals during the term of the contract and accordingly has not provided an accrual for this agreement. However
 if the performance goal were deemed probable as of December 31
 2016
 the Company would have established an accrual ranging from $305
000 to $1
015
000
 depending on the goal achieved.

 immediately prior to the closing of the IPO
 the Company converted the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock (&#8220;Series C&#8221;) to 11
067
090 shares of common stock. Based on the Series C anti-dilutive clause
 the conversion from Series C to common stock was to be equivalent to the 1-to-0.7396 common stock share split that occurred during 2014 in connection with the IPO.&nbsp;&nbsp;The converted Series C included 2

 and if declared by the Board of Directors. In addition
 holders of Series C were entitled to share ratably in any cash dividends declared and paid on the common stock in an amount per share equal to the amount of the dividend proposed to be paid on a share of common stock multiplied by the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C. Once the Series C shares were converted to common stock
 the accrued dividends that had not been declared by the Board of Directors were relinquished. Upon conversion
 none of the accrued dividends had been declared by the Board of Directors. Immediately prior to the conversion of Series C to Common Stock
 the Series C shares were fair valued utilizing the share price at the date of conversion. The difference between fair value and book value of $82

500
000 revolving note payable
 the Company entered into a Fee and Reimbursement Agreement with certain stockholders who were also guarantors of the note. That agreement stipulated that the Company would pay each guarantor a contingent fee equal to 10%&#160;per annum of the amount that each guarantor had committed to guarantee. The payment was to be made in the form of newly issued shares of Series C Preferred Stock at the price of $5.25 per share. The fee accrued only from and after the date that the Guarantor entered into the Guarantee
 and if at any time any Guarantor&#8217;s obligation was terminated in full or in part
 the Fee would continue to accrue only with respect to the amount
 if any of such Guarantor&#8217;s remaining commitment under the Credit Agreement. The fee was contingent in that it would become due and payable only if all principal and interest under the credit agreement had been repaid and a Change of Control had occurred. A Change of Control was defined as any sale
 merger
 consolidation
 share exchange
 business combination
 equity issuance
 or other transaction or series of related transactions
 specifically excluding public offerings
 which result in the stockholders immediately prior to the transaction(s) owning collectively less than 50% of the voting control immediately following the transaction(s); or (ii)&#160;any sale
 lease
 exchange
 transfer
 or other disposition of substantially all of the assets
 taken as a whole
 in a single transaction or series of transactions
 excluding sales in the ordinary course of business
 sale/leaseback and corporate restructuring transactions. 

 the Company converted outstanding fees under the guarantee into 2
477
756 shares of Series C
 which were then converted into 1
832
531 shares of common stock. 

 the Company measured the fair value of the outstanding fee on debt guarantee using an option pricing method with several possible distribution outcomes depending on the timing and kind of liquidity event. Expected volatility was estimated utilizing the historical volatility of similar companies. The risk-free interest rates was based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a period consistent with the expected contractual life. 

 and then subsequently into common stock
 the share price of the Company&#8217;s common stock was utilized to fair value the fees on debt guarantee and record the final fees on debt guarantee.

 or each group of similar guarantee obligations

 including its term

 and the events or circumstances that would require the guarantor to perform under the guarantee; (b) the maximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted) the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee; (c) the current carrying amount of the liability
 if any
 for the guarantor's obligations under the guarantee; and (d) the nature of any recourse provisions under the guarantee
 and any assets held either as collateral or by third parties

423
 and $1
563

 2015
 and 2014 included share-based compensation of approximately $221
559
 $201
086
 and $71

 and 2014 included share-based compensation of approximately $3
971
930
 $3
722
770
 and $1
492

 respectively. Capital expenditures recorded during the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015 for the Freshpet Kitchens expansion project included share-based compensation of approximately $31
660 and $52
566 respectively.

&#8212;In December 2006
 the Company approved the 2006 Stock Plan (the &#8220;2006 Plan&#8221;) under which options to purchase approximately 624
223 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock were granted to employees and affiliates of the Company. These options are time-based (vest over five years). Certain option awards provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control (as defined in the 2006 Plan). At December 31
 2016
 there were zero shares available for grant as the plan is frozen. 
&#8212;In December 2010
 the Company approved the 2010 Stock Plan (the &#8220;2010 Plan&#8221;) under which options to purchase approximately 2
146
shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock were granted to employees and affiliates of the Company (in 2012
 the 2010 Plan was amended to allow for option to purchase approximately 2
220
280 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock). These options are either time-based (vest over four years)
 performance-based (vest when performance targets are met
 as defined in the stock option grant agreement)
 or vest at the occurrence of an exit event which is defined as a Change of Control in the Company or an initial public offering registered under the Securities Act
 as defined in the stock grant agreement. 

 the Company modified its performance-based awards and exit-event awards under the 2010 Plan. All performance-based awards (680
753 awards) were modified to time-vested awards that cliff vest over two years. At the time of the November 2014 modification the original performance-based awards&#8217; vesting criteria was not considered probable. In addition
 all exit-event awards (657
693 awards) were modified to performance-based awards.  

 the Company modified 419
366 of its performance-based awards to time-based awards that vest over two years. These awards were originally included in the November 2014 modification from exit-event awards to performance-based awards. At the time of the December 2016 modification the performance-based awards&#8217; vesting criteria was not considered probable. 

 2016 the vesting of any remaining performance-based awards which were not modified in December 2016 is not considered probable of vesting and accordingly the Company has not recognized the related compensation expense.

&#8212;In November 2014
 the Company approved the 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the &#8220;2014 Plan&#8221;) under which 1
479
200 shares of common stock may be issued or used for reference purposes as awards granted under the 2014 Plan. In September 2016
 the 2014 Plan was amended to allow for the granting of an additional 2
500
000 shares of common stock to be issued or used for reference purposes as awards granted
 for a total of 3
979
200 shares. These awards may be in the form of stock options
 stock appreciation rights
 restricted stock
 as well as other stock-based and cash-based awards. As of December 31
 2016
 the awards granted were either time-based (cliff vest over three years)
 performance-based (vest when performance targets are met
 as defined in the stock option grant agreement)
 or restricted stock units (employee RSUs cliff vest over three years and non-employee director RSUs cliff vest over one year).

 2016
 there were 2
627
585 shares of common stock available to be issued or used for reference purposes under the 2014 Plan. 
&#8212;During the year ended December 31
 2016
 500
000 service period stock options and 500
000 performance-based stock options were granted to the Company&#8217;s CEO as an inducement under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. Under the terms of the agreement
 the grant is governed as if issued under the 2014 Omnibus Plan. As of December 31
 2016
 the awards granted were time-based (cliff vest over four years) and performance-based (vest when performance targets are met
 as defined in the stock option grant agreement).

&#8212;The weighted average grant date fair value of options (service period options and performance based options) granted during the years ended December 31
 2016
 2015
 and 2014 were $5.09
 $7.66 and $8.35&#160;per share
 respectively. 
For the grants during the year ended December&#160;31
 2013
 the expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of the Company&#8217;s common stock. 

 we no longer deemed it appropriate to use historical volatility as it was not representative of the Company&#8217;s stock on the public market.&nbsp;&nbsp;As such expected volatility that was utilized was based upon the volatility of a group of similar entities
 referred to as &#8220;guideline&#8221; companies. As Freshpet has more historical data based on more time as a public company
 the historical volatility of Freshpet becomes a more significant input.
&#8212;The Company determined the expected term based on the &#8220;shortcut method&#8221; described in FASB ASC 718
 Compensation&#8212;

&#8212;The Company has not historically declared dividends
 and no future dividends are expected to be available to benefit option holders. Accordingly
 the Company used an expected dividend yield of zero in the valuation model.

 &#8211; The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
 as determined at a later date
 could differ from those estimates. 











The Company at times holds interest-bearing certificates of deposits with financial institutions with maturities ranging from three months to one year. Certificates of deposit are classified as short-term investments and interest is recorded as other expenses
 net. Historically
 interest income has not been material. The Company will continue to monitor interest income and will disclose separately if significant. 





 &#8211; The Company records trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts. On a periodic basis
 the Company evaluates its accounts receivable and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its history of write-offs and collections and current credit conditions. Accounts receivable are written off when management deems them to be uncollectible. 





 &#8211; Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market
 using the first-in
 first-out method. When necessary
 the Company provides allowances to adjust the carrying value of its inventories to the lower of cost or net realizable value
 including any costs to sell or dispose and consideration for obsolescence
 excessive inventory levels
 product deterioration and other factors in evaluating net realizable value. 



Property
 Plant and Equipment



 plant and equipment are recorded at cost. The Company provides for depreciation on the straight-line method by charges to income at rates based upon estimated recovery periods of 7 years for furniture and office equipment
 5 years for automotive equipment
 9 years for refrigeration equipment
 5 to 10 years for machinery and equipment
 and 15 to 39 years for building and improvements. Capitalized cost includes the costs incurred to bring the property
 plant and equipment to the condition and location necessary for its intended use
 which includes any necessary delivery
 electrical and installation cost for equipment. Maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful life of the assets over two years are charged to expense as incurred. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful lives on the straight-line method. 





 &#8211; The Company evaluates all long-lived assets for impairment. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future net cash flows
 an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to their fair value less estimated costs to sell. Estimating future cash flows and calculating fair value of assets requires significant estimates and assumptions by management. If the carrying amount is not fully recoverable
 an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carry amount to fair value
 and is charged to expense in the period of impairment. 





&#8211; The Company provides for deferred income taxes for temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting
 principally net operating loss carryforwards
 depreciation
 and share-based compensation. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 

 the deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31
 2016
 and 2015
 the Company determined that a valuation allowance of 100% is appropriate. 





&#8211; Revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment to the customers as terms are free on board (&#8220;FOB&#8221;) shipping point
 at which point title and risk of loss is transferred and the selling price is fixed or determinable. This completes the revenue-earning process specifically that an arrangement exists
 delivery has occurred
 ownership has transferred
 the price is fixed and collectability is reasonably assured. A provision for payment discounts and product return allowances
 which is estimated based upon the Company&#8217;s historical performance
 management&#8217;s experience and current economic trends
 is recorded as a reduction of sales in the same period that the revenue is recognized. 

 consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances and merchandising funds
 and consumer coupons are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of estimated trade incentive spending
 which is recognized as incurred at the time of sale. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are included as accrued expense in the consolidated balance sheet. Coupon redemption costs are also recognized as reductions of net sales when the coupons are issued. Estimates of trade promotion expense and coupon redemption costs are based upon programs offered
 timing of those offers
 estimated redemption/usage rates from historical performance
 management&#8217;s experience and current economic trends. 





 &#8211; Advertising costs are expensed when incurred
 with the exception of production costs which are expensed the first time advertising takes place. Advertising costs
 consisting primarily of media ads
 were $15
374
392
 $16
302
237
 and $14
231
930
 in 2016
 2015
 and 2014
 respectively. 





 &#8211; Costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in selling
 general
 and administrative expenses within the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Shipping and handling costs primarily consist of costs associated with moving finished products to customers
 including costs associated with our distribution center and the cost of shipping products to customers through third-party carriers. Shipping and handling cost totaled $11

 and $9

 2015
 and 2014
 respectively.











 &#8211; The Company recognizes share-based compensation based on the value of the portion of share-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period. Share-based compensation expense recognized in the statement of operations included compensation expense for share-based payment awards granted subsequent to December 31
 2006
 based on the grant date fair value estimated. Share awards are amortized under the straight-line method over the requisite service period of the entire award. Upon the adoption of ASU 2016-09
 the Company no longer estimates expected forfeitures but accounts for forfeitures as they occur.

 whichever is more reliably measurable. 





 &#8211; Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) guidance specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources
 while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). 



















 either directly or indirectly (e.g.
 quoted prices of similar assets or liabilities in active markets
 or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active). Level 2 includes financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. 









 discounted cash flows or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. 

 other receivables
 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments. The warrant liability is recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. 

 2016
 the Company only maintained Level 1 assets and liabilities.

 Freshpet entered into an incentive agreement with a vendor. Under the terms of the agreement
 a cash incentive will be earned by the vendor upon achievement of certain performance goals that must be reached by the end of the contract term
 which expires on November 30
 2017. The incentive payout is based on the fair value of the Company&#8217;s common stock price as of the achievement date specified within the contract. As of December 31
 2016
 the Company does not believe it is probable that the vendor will reach the performance goals during the term of the contract and accordingly has not provided an accrual for this agreement. However
 if the performance goal were deemed probable as of December 31
 2016
 the Company would have established an accrual ranging from $305
000 to $1
015

 depending on the goal achieved.

Risk-free interest rate
 minimum








Risk-free interest rate
 maximum


























































































































The estimated measure of the percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.
