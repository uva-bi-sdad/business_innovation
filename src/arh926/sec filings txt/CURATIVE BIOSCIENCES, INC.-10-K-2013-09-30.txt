Healthient
 Inc.
 and its wholly owned subsidiary
 SnackHealthy
 Inc.
 develops and markets delicious snacks and beverages that make healthy eating a fun experience for the entire family. The Company&#8217;s goal is to successfully position a &#8220;better for you&#8221; portfolio of products to American families as convenient
We commenced sales in the third quarter ended March 31
 2011. Our principal executive offices are located at 15132 Park of Commerce Blvd.
 Jupiter
 FL 33478 and our phone number is (561) 935-6449.

The Company is considered to be in the Development Stage as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 7
 &#8220;Accounting and Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises&#8221;. The Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to the corporate formation. Activities during the Development Stage include developing the business plan and raising capital.





Our Company was organized under the laws of the state of California on November 5
 1996 as Renet Services
 Inc.&#160;&#160;The name was changed to Time Lending
 California
 Inc. on August 4
 1998 and we reincorporated in the state of Nevada in December
 2000 by merging with Time Lending California
 Inc.
 a Nevada corporation. Time Lending California
 Inc.&#160;subsequently changed its name to Time Associates, Inc.&#160;&#160;Effective as of October 5
 2010
 Time Associates
 Inc. entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of September 23
 2010 (the Reorganization Agreement) with Healthient
 Inc. a Nevada corporation organized April 29
 2009 (Healthient) and Healthient shareholders. In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Reorganization Agreement
 the Company acquired Healthient in exchange for 43
618
356 newly issued restricted shares of common voting stock of the Company to the Healthient shareholders on a pro rata basis for the purpose of effecting a tax-free reorganization pursuant to sections 351
 354 and 368(a)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended. As a condition of the closing of the share exchange transaction
 a majority shareholder of the Company cancelled all of his 188
572 shares. In addition
 as a condition of the closing of the transaction
 the Company spun off its operating subsidiary Time Marketing
 Inc. Pursuant to the terms of the Reorganization Agreement
 each one (1) share of common stock of Healthient has been exchanged for three (3) shares of the Company's common stock. Following the Closing Date
 there were 43
778
433 shares of the Registrant's common stock outstanding. Immediately prior to the Closing
 there were 160
077 shares issued and outstanding (assuming the cancellation of the shares held by the majority shareholder at the closing).&#160;&#160;The shareholders of Healthient owned 99.6% of the common stock outstanding of the Company after the issuance of the 43
618
356 shares. On November 15
 2010 Time Associates
 Inc. changed its name to Healthient, Inc.

The acquisition of Healthient by the Company on October 5
 2010 has been accounted for as a purchase and treated as a reverse acquisition and re-capitalization since the former owners of Healthient controlled 99.6% of the total shares of common stock of the Company outstanding immediately following the acquisition. In November 2010 Healthient
 Inc. changed its name to SnackHealthy, Inc.&#160;&#160;SnackHealthy
 Inc.
 a Nevada corporation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
















On July 19
 2010 the Company effected a seventy (70) for one (1) reverse stock split of its common stock. There were 23
398
040 shares of common stock outstanding before the reverse stock split and 348
649 after the stock split.


As of August 7
 2010
 the Company sold two of its&#160;fifty-percent owned subsidiaries
 Time Management
 Inc. and&#160;Tenth Street
 Inc. to those companies&#8217; shareholders for a price of $10.00 each.


On this basis
 the historical financial statements prior to October 5
 2010 have been restated to be those of the accounting acquirer Healthient (now SnackHealthy
 Inc.). The historical stockholders' equity prior to the reverse acquisition has been retroactively restated (a re-capitalization) for the equivalent number of shares received in the acquisition after giving effect to any difference in par value of the issuer's and acquirer's stock. The original 160
078 shares of common stock outstanding prior to the exchange reorganization have been reflected as an addition in the stockholders' equity account of the Company on October 5
 2010.





We are in the business of manufacturing
 distribution
 marketing and sale of healthy and &#8216;better for you&#8221; snack food and beverage products. These products include freeze dried fruit

 improve their health and experience life-changing results. Our snacks and beverages appeal to the growing base of consumers seeking differentiated products and desiring a healthier lifestyle.

Our products may often be sold as part of a program
 and therefore our portfolio is comprised of a series of related products designed to simplify weight management and nutrition for our consumers and maximize cross-selling opportunities. These programs target specific consumer market segments
 such as women
 men or children
 as well as weight-management customers and individuals looking to enhance their overall well being.

Product
Development

We are committed to providing consumers with delicious healthy snacks and beverage mixes to help them achieve and maintain their healthy weight. We believe this can be best accomplished in part by introducing new products and by upgrading
 reformulating and repackaging existing product lines.

New product ideas are generated and narrowed down to high potential ideas that fill our business needs and conform to our overall strategy. We test the most promising ideas with brand partners and customers. This testing is followed by a feasibility assessment
 which includes a review of product and package prototypes
 product positioning and messaging
 process design and analysis of manufacturing issues.

The next stage is the development phase in which we finalize the formula
 process
 manufacturing strategy
 product positioning
 pricing
 labeling and other related matters. The fourth stage is the launch phase in which we prepare promotional and sales materials
 complete the supply chain plan and complete other final preparations for launch. After the product is launched
 we will closely track sales performance and the lessons learned so we can update and improve the product development process.



Our products are manufactured by third parties. We work closely with our vendors in an effort to achieve the highest quality standards and product availability. We continually strive to establish excellent relationships with our manufacturers and to obtain improvements in product quality and product delivery. Some of our key input materials such as whey proteins and packaging materials are subject to pricing fluctuations driven by commodities pricing. We are confident that we can offset potential cost increases of these materials with volume increases in our inventory purchases and
 when necessary
 by raising the prices of our products.

In order to coordinate and manage the manufacturing of our products
 we will utilize a demand planning and forecasting process that is directly tied to our production planning and purchasing systems. Using a planning process allows us to balance our inventory levels while minimizing working capital and inventory obsolescence.
























We consider research and development of new products to be a significant part of our overall philosophy and we are committed to developing innovative
 high-quality products that exceed consumer expectations. In addition to developing new products
 we may from time to time reformulate and improve existing products based on advances in ingredients and technology.&#160;&#160;&#160;We have not spent any significant amount of funds on research and development in fiscal 2013.






We plan to distribute snack food products throughout the United States using a direct-store-delivery (&#8220;DSD&#8221;) network of distribution routes
 most of which will serviced by IBOs and others that may be company-owned.





We sell our products to grocery/mass merchandisers
 club stores
 discount stores
 convenience stores
 food service establishments and various other retailers including drug stores
 schools
 military and government facilities and &#8220;up and down the street&#8221; outlets such as recreational facilities
 offices and other independent retailers. Consumers can also purchase our products directly from the Company on snackhealthy.com.




Our products are sold in highly competitive markets. Generally
 we compete with manufacturers
 many of whom have greater revenues and resources than we do. The principal methods of competition are price
 service
 product quality
 product offerings and distribution. The methods of competition and our competitive position vary according to the geographic location
 the particular products and the activities of our competitors.





Our operations in the United States are subject to various federal
 state and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters. However
 the Company was not a party to any material proceedings arising under these laws or regulations for the periods covered by this Form 10-K. We believe the Company is in compliance with all material environmental regulations affecting our facility and operations and that continued compliance will not have a material impact on our capital expenditures
 earnings or competitive position.


















We make available free of charge on our website our Annual Reports on Form 10-K
 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q
 Current Reports on Form 8-K as soon as reasonably practical after we file such material with
 or furnish it to
 the Securities and Exchange Commission
 or SEC. This information is also available in print to any shareholder who requests it
 with any such requests addressed to Investor Relations
 15132 Park of Commerce Boulevard
 Second Floor
 Jupiter
 Florida 33478.&#160;&#160;Certain of these documents may also be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains an Internet website that contains reports
 and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at 




In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K
 the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business
 financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties
 including risks that we do not presently know of or currently deem insignificant
 may also impair our business
 financial condition or results of operations.



Recessionary pressures from an overall decline in U.S. economic activity could adversely impact our business and financial results. Economic uncertainty may reduce consumer spending in our sales channels and create a shift in consumer preference toward private label products. Shifts in consumer spending could result in increased pressure from competitors or customers to reduce the prices of some of our products and/or limit our ability to increase or maintain prices
 which could lower our revenues and profitability. Instability in the financial markets may impact our ability or increase the cost to enter into credit agreements in the future. Additionally
 it may weaken the ability of our customers
 suppliers
 IBOs
 distributors
 banks
 insurance companies and other business partners to perform in the normal course of business
 which could expose us to losses or disrupt the supply of inputs we rely upon to conduct our business. If one or more of our key business partners fail to perform as expected or contracted for any reason
 our business could be negatively impacted.


Volatility in the price or availability of the inputs we depend on
 including raw materials
 packaging
 energy and labor
 could adversely impact our financial results. 
Continued growth would require us to hire
 retain and develop a highly skilled workforce and talented management team. Any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan for current positions could erode our competitiveness. In addition
 our financial results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees
 higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs.



Price competition and industry consolidation could adversely impact our financial results. The sales of most of our products are subject to significant competition primarily through discounting and other price cutting techniques by competitors
 many of whom are significantly larger and have greater resources than we do. In addition
 there is a continuing consolidation in the snack food industry
 which could increase competition. Significant competition increases the possibility that we could lose one or more major customers
 lose existing product authorizations at customer locations
 lose market share and/or shelf space
 increase expenditures or reduce selling prices
 which could have an adverse impact on our business or financial results.
Sales price increases initiated by us may negatively impact our financial results. Future price increases
 such as those to offset increased ingredient costs
 may reduce our overall sales volume
 which could reduce revenues and operating profit. Additionally
 if market prices for certain ingredients decline significantly below our contracted prices
 customer pressure to reduce prices could lower revenues and operating profit.


















We may be exposed to risks resulting from large retailers that could account for a significant portion of our revenue. The loss of one or more large retailers could adversely affect our financial results. These customers typically make purchase decisions based on a combination of price
 product quality
 product offerings
 consumer demand
 distribution capabilities and customer service and generally do not enter into long-term contracts. In addition
 these significant retailers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices related to inventories
 product displays
 logistics or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if revenue from one or more of these customers is significantly reduced or if the cost of complying with customers&#8217; demands is significant. If receivables from one or more of these customers become uncollectible
 our financial results may be adversely impacted.



There are risks associated with our ability to retain key employees. If certain key employees terminate their employment
 it could negatively impact sales
 marketing or development activities. Further
 management&#8217;s attention might be diverted from operations to recruiting suitable replacements and our financial condition
 results of operations and growth prospects could be adversely affected. In addition
 we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for key employees or offer employment to potential replacements on acceptable terms.



If we are unsuccessful due to our execution
 unplanned events
 ability to manage change or unfavorable market conditions
 our financial performance could be adversely affected. If we pursue strategic acquisitions
 divestitures
 or joint ventures
 we may incur significant costs and may not be able to consummate the transactions or obtain financing.



We could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products or ingredients. Negative publicity about these concerns
 whether or not valid
 may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause disruptions in production or distribution of our products and negatively impact our business and financial results.


If our products become adulterated
 misbranded or mislabeled

 contaminated or damaged. We also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products causes injury or illness. A product recall or an adverse result in any such litigation could have an adverse effect on our operating and financial results. We may also lose customer confidence for our entire brand portfolio.



Our ability to manufacture
 distribute and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities or the supply and delivery of key inputs
 such as raw materials
 finished goods
 packaging
 labor and energy
 could impair our ability to conduct our business. Examples include
 but are not limited to
 weather
 natural disasters
 fires
 terrorism
 pandemics and strikes. Certain warehouses and manufacturing facilities may be located in areas prone to tornadoes
 hurricanes and floods. Any business disruption due to natural disasters or catastrophic events in these areas could adversely impact our business and financial results if not adequately mitigated. We also rely on a certain supplier for the manufacturing of one of our core branded products. Although we have secured back-up suppliers in the case of emergency
 any damage or disruption to this supplier's manufacturing or distribution capabilities could impair our ability to sell this product.
Also
 we increasingly rely on information technology systems to conduct our business. These systems can enhance efficiency and business processes but also present risks of unauthorized access to our networks or data centers. If unauthorized parties gain access to our systems
 they could obtain and exploit confidential business
 customer
 or employee information and harm our competitive position. Further
 these information systems may experience damage
 failures
 interruptions
 errors
 inefficiencies
 attacks or suffer from fires or natural disasters
 any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results if not adequately mitigated by our security measures and disaster recovery plans.


















Consumers are moving away from traditional means of electronic mail towards new forms of electronic communication
 including social media. We support new ways of sharing data and communicating with customers using methods such as social networking. However
 misuse of social networking by individuals
 customers
 competitors
 or employees may result in unfavorable media attention which could negatively affect our business. Further
 our competitors are increasingly using social media networks to market and advertise products. If we are unable to compete in this environment it could adversely affect our financial results.


We are a consumer products company operating in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products. To generate revenues and profits
 we must sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers. Any significant changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products and erosion of our competitive and financial position. Our success depends on the ability to respond to consumer trends
 including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness
 obesity
 product attributes and ingredients. In addition
 changes in product category consumption or consumer demographics could result in reduced demand for our products. Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors
 including the aging of the general population
 changes in social trends
 changes in travel
 vacation or leisure activity patterns
 or negative publicity resulting from regulatory action or litigation against companies in the snack food industry. Any of these changes may reduce consumers&#8217; willingness to purchase our products and negatively impact our financial results.


Our continued success also is dependent on product innovation
 including maintaining a robust pipeline of new products
 and the effectiveness of advertising campaigns
 marketing programs and product packaging. Although we devote significant resources to meet this goal
 there can be no assurance as to the continued ability to develop and launch successful new products or variants of existing products
 or to effectively execute advertising campaigns and marketing programs. In addition
 both the launch and ongoing success of new products and advertising campaigns are inherently uncertain
 especially as to their appeal to consumers. Further
 failure to successfully launch new products could decrease demand for existing products by negatively affecting consumer perception of existing brands
 as well as result in inventory write-offs
 trademark impairments and other costs
 all of which could negatively impact our financial results.


Our distribution network relies on a significant number of IBOs
 and such reliance could affect our ability to efficiently and profitably distribute and market products

 many of which are outside of our control. Some of these factors include: (i) the level of demand for the brands and products which are available in a particular distribution area; (ii) the ability to price products at levels competitive with those offered by other competing producers; and (iii) the ability to deliver products in the quantity and at the time ordered by IBOs and retailers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate the risks related to all or any of these factors in any of the current or prospective geographic areas of distribution. To the extent that any of these factors have an adverse effect on the relationships with IBOs in a particular geographic area and
 thus
 limit our ability to maintain and expand the sales market
 revenues and financial results may be adversely impacted.





















We will maintain trademarks and other intellectual property rights
 which are important to our success and competitive position
 and the loss of or our inability to enforce trademark and other proprietary intellectual property rights could harm our business. We will devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis. Efforts to establish and protect trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products. In addition
 the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some foreign countries may not allow for the protection of proprietary rights to the same extent as in the United States and other countries.



The net carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities
 and the net carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks
 customer relationships and other acquired intangibles. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
 we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or at any time when events occur which could impact the value of our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangibles. These values depend on a variety of factors
 including the success of our business
 market conditions
 earnings growth and expected cash flows. Impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control
 such as increasing competitive pricing pressures
 changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital or lower than expected sales and profit growth rates. Significant and unanticipated changes could require a non-cash charge for impairment in a future period which may significantly affect our financial results in the period of such charge.



Food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal
 state and other governmental agencies. New or increased government regulation of the food industry
 including but not limited to areas related to food safety
 chemical composition
 production processes
 traceability
 product quality
 packaging
 labeling
 school lunch guidelines
 promotions
 marketing and advertising (particularly such communications that are directed toward children)
 product recalls
 records
 storage and distribution could adversely impact our results of operations by increasing production costs or restricting our methods of operation and distribution. These regulations may address food industry or society factors
 such as obesity
 nutritional and environmental concerns and diet trends.


A significant portion of our outstanding shares of common stock is controlled by a few individuals

 William M. Alverson and his wife
 Katherine T. Alverson
 beneficially owned a majority of the outstanding common stock of the Company. Mr. and Mrs. Alverson serve as directors of the Company
 with Mrs. Alverson serving as President and Mr. Alverson serving as the Chairman of the Board. As a result
 the Alverson may be able to exercise significant influence over the Company and certain matters requiring approval of its stockholders
 including the approval of significant corporate transactions
 such as a merger or other sale of the Company or its assets. This could limit the ability of other stockholders of the Company to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the Company. In addition
 the Alversons may have actual or potential interests that diverge from the interests of the other stockholders of the Company. Sales by the Alversons of their shares into the public market
 or the perception that such sales could occur
 could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.

 nor does the Company intend to do so. The Company has no formal policy with respect to investments in real estate or investments with persons primarily engaged in real estate activities.




In 2011 Siesta Flow LLC filed a legal action against the Company in the Twelfth Circuit Court of Sarasota County
 Florida
 alleging breach of contract and seeking damages in the amount of approximately $95
000 plus costs. In April
 2012
 the court has issued final summary judgment against the Company in the total amount of $95
000
 which amount was subsequently settled in the amount of $75
000 and satisfied by the Company.


In June of 2013
 a former officer of the Company filed a lawsuit against the Company and its Preseident and directors alleging several counts
 including a breach of contract and fiduciary duty
 and seeking damages in the amount of $122
300 and other unspecified damages.&#160;&#160;The Company considers the lawsuit without any merit and will defend it vigorously.&#160;&#160;On September 18
 2013
 the plaintiff filed a motion to compel early mediation.

As a development stage
 snack food company
 we have been primarily engaged in developing our infrastructure and a product portfolio of snacks and beverage mixes designed to help people achieve and maintain their healthy weight.&#160;&#160;We commenced sales of two products from our product lines in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 and had net revenue of $314
980 for the fiscal year ended June 30
 2012.


During 2013
 we began to implement our strategic plan
 which provides for future growth of our existing core brands through a new expanded distribution method
 innovation and advertising. Our primary focus was on decreasing general and administrative costs associated with network marketing and improving sales and profit margins through pricing strategies and enhanced packaging and product configuration. To accomplish this we began the process of winding down the network marketing sales in order to better position the Company to serve retailers and ultimately
 the end consumer. We completed this project in the last quarter of fiscal 2013 and the Company is now prepared to focus on mass retail distribution.
















Our products are grouped in two principal categories: weight management and energy
 sports &amp; fitness
 along with premium marketing websites and promotional items. Our products are often sold in packages that are comprised of a variety of related products designed to simplify healthy snacking and weight management for consumers and to maximize cross-selling opportunities for us.

Industry wide factors that affect us include the increasing prevalence of obesity in adults and children
 which are driving the demand for healthier snacking alternatives.







The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary SnackHealthy
 Inc. All significant inter&#8211;company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.











The carrying value of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments
 including cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable
 and due to related parties
 as reported in the accompanying balance sheets
 approximates fair value.




In accordance with ASC 350
 the Company regularly reviews the carrying value of intangible and other long-lived assets for the existence of facts or circumstances
 both internally and externally
 that may suggest impairment. If impairment testing indicates a lack of recoverability
 an impairment loss is recognized by the Company if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.





The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
 the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.





Revenue is recognized when products are shipped
 which is when title and risk of loss pass to brand partners and preferred customers who are the Company&#8217;s customers. The Company requires credit card payment at the point of sale. The Company has determined that no allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary. Amounts received prior to shipment and title passage to brand partners are recorded as deferred revenue. The compensation plan for the Company&#8217;s brand partners generally does not provide rebates or selling discounts to brand partners who purchase its products and services. The Company classifies selling discounts and rebates
 if any
 as a reduction of revenue.





Inventory comprises packaged healthy snacks ready for final sale
 and is stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined by the first-in
 first out method.



















Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated life of the asset
 which is 3-7 years.





Costs incurred in the planning state of a websites are expensed
 while costs incurred in the development stage are capitalized and amortized over the estimated three year life of the asset. The drink license is also being amortized over three years.





The Company accounts for income taxes under FASB Codification Topic 740-10-25 (&#8220;ASC 740-10-25&#8221;) Income Taxes.&#160;&#160;Under ASC 740-10-25
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.&#160;&#160;Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.&#160;&#160;Under ASC 740-10-25
 the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.




The financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company had a net loss of $3
175
829 during the year ended June 30
 2013. Cash used in operations for the year approximated $157
000. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company&#8217;s ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan.





However
 there can be no assurance that the raising of equity will be successful. Failure to achieve the needed equity funding could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.



In December 2004
 the FASB issued FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718
.&#160;&#160;Under FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718
 companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options
 restricted share plans
 performance-based awards
 share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans.&#160;&#160;As such
 compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value.&#160;&#160;Such compensation amounts
 if any
 are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option grant.&#160;&#160;The Company applies this statement prospectively.

















Equity instruments (&#8220;instruments&#8221;) issued to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments
 as required by FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718.&#160; FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 505
 defines the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments.&#160; In general
 the measurement date is when either a (a) performance commitment
 as defined
 is reached or (b) the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.




Net Loss per Common Share is computed pursuant to FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 260



There are no warrants outstanding as of June 30
 2013.





There have been no recent accounting pronouncements of changes in accounting pronouncements that impacted the year ended June 30
 2013 and June 30
 2012
 or which are expected to impact future periods
 that were not already adopted and disclosed in prior periods.



&#8220;Net sales

 represent what we collect and recognize as net revenues in our financial statements.

Our results of operations for the periods below are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for future periods
 which depend upon numerous factors
 including our ability to recruit new brand partners
 retain existing brand partners
 open new markets
 further penetrate existing markets
 introduce new products and programs that will help our brand partners increase their retail efforts and develop niche markets.



Net sales are directly associated with the efforts of our brand partner force
 retailing of our products
 the quality and completeness of our product offerings that we offer to consumers and retail stores.

Management&#8217;s role is to provide brand partners with a competitive and relevant product line
 encourage strong teamwork and leadership among brand partners and offer leading edge business tools to make doing business with SnackHealthy simple and fun.

We believe that the correct business foundation
 coupled with promotional initiatives
 is required for the retention of retail customers and the in store retailing of our products. This correct business foundation includes strong management
 a broad product line that appeals to consumer needs
 a favorable regulatory environment
 and a scalable and stable technology platform.

We anticipate that our strategy will continue to include creating and maintaining growth within existing markets
 while expanding into new markets.



















Our results of operations for the periods below are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for future periods
 which depend on numerous factors
 including our ability to open new markets
 further penetrate existing markets
 introduce new products and programs that will help increase our retail efforts and develop niche markets.





As anticipated
 total revenue decreased compared to 2012 primarily due to winding down the network marketing distribution in the last half of the year. Revenues for the year ended June 30
 2013 were $161
954 as compared to $314
980 for the year ended June 30
 2012.&#160;&#160;





Costs of revenues were $105
672 largely due to a write down in inventory.





Gross profit for fiscal year ending 2013 was $56
282.





Selling expenses were $19
952.

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits to our general management
 finance and administrative staff
 professional advisor fees
 audit fees and other expenses incurred in connection with general operations.&#160;&#160;Our general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30
 2013 were $874
635
 which represented a decrease of $5
461
626 compared to the same period in 2012.&#160;&#160;The decrease was primary due to an issuance of common stock for independent contractors of $4
479
526 during the year ended June 30
 2012 as compared to the $149
987 of expense for independent contractors in 2013. Salaries and wages also decreased year over year because $720
000 of shares were issued for wages for the year ended June 30
 2012.


Travel and entertainment decreased from $86
281 to $12
181 as a direct result of winding down the network marketing distribution system.



















During the year ended June 30
 2012 the Company settled a lawsuit by agreeing to issue 19
100
000 shares of common stock. During the year the Company issued 9
124
000 shares at the market price valued at $7
562
500 (see Financial Statements).










Net loss for the year ended June 30
 2013 was $6
637

799
500) as compared to $7
998
164 (included settlement expenses of $1
719
000) for the same period in 2012.&#160;The decrease was due primarily to the issuance of stock for independent contractor and wage expenses in the year ended June 30
 2012.




Generally
 our principal uses of cash includes operating expenses
 particularly selling expenses
 and working capital (principally inventory purchases)
 as well as capital expenditures and the development of operations in new markets.&#160;&#160;The capital expenditures to date have been primarily related to the following:

























the purchase of office furniture
 phone systems and equipment;

For the Years ended June 30
&nbsp;2013 and
2012





 2010 Time Associates

the Company&quot;) acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Healthient
 Inc.
 a Nevada corporation organized
April 29
 2009 (&quot;Healthient&quot;) in exchange for the issuance by the Company of a total of 43
618
356 newly issued restricted
shares of common voting stock to the Healthient shareholders pursuant the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of September
23
 2010. Prior to the issuance of the shares
 the Company had 160
078 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Subsequent
to the exchange there were 43
778
434 shares issued and outstanding. The shareholders of Healthient owned 99.6% of the common stock
outstanding of the Company after the issuance of the 43
618
356 shares. On November 15
 2010 Time Associates
 Inc. name was changed
to Healthient
 Inc.


 2010
has been accounted for as a purchase and treated as a reverse acquisition and re-capitalization since the former owners of Healthient
controlled 99.6% of the total shares of Common Stock of the Company outstanding immediately following the acquisition. In November
2010 Healthient
 Inc. changed its name to SnackHealthy
 Inc.


 the historical financial statements prior to October
5
 2010 have been restated to be those of the accounting acquirer Healthient (now SnackHealthy
 Inc.). The historical stockholders'
equity prior to the reverse acquisition has been retroactively restated (a re-capitalization) for the equivalent number of shares
received in the acquisition after giving effect to any difference in par value of the issuer's and acquirer's stock. The original
160
078 shares of common stock outstanding prior to the exchange reorganization have been reflected as an addition in the stockholders'
equity account of the Company on October 5
 2010.

 2013. Cash used in operations

recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based
compensation arrangements include stock options
 restricted share plans
 performance-based awards
 share appreciation rights and
employee share purchase plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;As such
 compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such
compensation amounts

 the measurement date is when either a (a) performance commitment

The Company has disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-14and 15d-14 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended) to ensure that material information contained in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported on a timely and accurate basis. Based on such evaluation
 the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective at ensuring that material information is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported on a timely and accurate basis in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Since such evaluation there have not been any significant changes in the Company's internal controls
 or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls.




Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.&#160;&#160;Under the supervision and with the participation of our management
 which consists of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#8220;COSO&#8221;)
.&#160;&#160;Based on their evaluation
 our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30
 2013
 based on these criteria.



During the quarter ended June 30
 2013
 there were no changes in our internal controls that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to have materially affected our internal control over financial reporting.

Our management
 including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system
 no matter how well designed and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance that the objectives of the control system is met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
 within the company have been detected.



















On September 12
 2013
 the Company's Board of Directors and its Majority Shareholders approved an amendment to its 2010 Equity Compensation Plan (the Plan) providing for the issuance of an additional two million (2
000
000) shares of common stock and ratifying previous amendments of the Plan.&#160;&#160;The action was approved by the written consent of 24
892
164 shares (60.04%).

Our certificate of incorporation limits
 to the maximum extent permitted under Nevada law
 the personal liability of directors and officers for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duties as directors and officers
 except in circumstances involving wrongful acts
 such as a breach of the director's duty of loyalty or acts of omission which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law.


Nevada Law permits us to indemnify officers
 directors or employees against expenses
 including attorney's fees
 judgments
 fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with legal proceedings if the officer
 director or employee acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to our best interest
 and
 with respect to any criminal act or proceeding
 he had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. Indemnification is not permitted as to any matter as to which the person is adjudged to be liable unless
 and only to the extent that
 the court in which such action or suit was brought upon application that
 despite the adjudication of liability
 but in view of all the circumstances of the case
 the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court deems proper. Individuals who successfully defend this type of action are entitled to indemnification against expenses reasonably incurred in connection therewith.


Our by-laws require us to indemnify directors and officers against
 to the fullest extent permitted by law
 liabilities which they may incur under the circumstances described in the preceding paragraph.

 2010 Time Associates
 a Nevada corporation (&amp;#34; the Company&amp;#34;) acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock&#13;of Healthient
 Inc.
 a Nevada corporation organized April 29
 2009 (&amp;#34;Healthient&amp;#34;) in exchange for the issuance by the&#13;Company of a total of 43
618
356 newly issued restricted shares of common voting stock to the Healthient shareholders pursuant&#13;the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of September 23
 2010. Prior to the issuance of the shares
 the Company had&#13;160
078 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Subsequent to the exchange there were 43
778
434 shares issued and outstanding.&#13;The shareholders of Healthient owned 99.6% of the common stock outstanding of the Company after the issuance of the 43
618
356&#13;shares. On November 15
 2010 Time Associates
 Inc. name was changed to Healthient

 2010 has been accounted for as a purchase and treated as a reverse acquisition and&#13;re-capitalization since the former owners of Healthient controlled 99.6% of the total shares of Common Stock of the Company outstanding&#13;immediately following the acquisition. In November 2010 Healthient
 Inc. changed its name to SnackHealthy

 the historical financial statements prior to October 5
 2010 have been restated to be those of the accounting acquirer&#13;Healthient (now SnackHealthy
 Inc.). The historical stockholders' equity prior to the reverse acquisition has been retroactively&#13;restated (a re-capitalization) for the equivalent number of shares received in the acquisition after giving effect to any difference&#13;in par value of the issuer's and acquirer's stock. The original 160
078 shares of common stock outstanding prior to the exchange&#13;reorganization have been reflected as an addition in the stockholders' equity account of the Company on October 5

&#13;Inc.
 and its wholly owned subsidiary
 SnackHealthy
 Inc.
 develop and market snacks and beverages with the objective of making&#13;healthy eating a fun experience for the entire family. The Company&amp;#146;s goal is to develop a portfolio of products and successfully&#13;position them as convenient
 healthy solutions across several snacking occasions daily. The Company sold snacks through a network&#13;marketing distribution model until the third quarter of the year ended June 30

 which is when title&#13;and risk of loss pass to brand partners and preferred customers who are the Company&amp;#146;s customers. The Company requires credit&#13;card payment at the point of sale. The Company has determined that no allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary. Amounts received&#13;prior to shipment and title passage to brand partners are recorded as deferred revenue. The compensation plan for the Company&amp;#146;s&#13;brand partners generally does not provide rebates or selling discounts to brand partners who purchase its products and services.&#13;The Company classifies selling discounts and rebates

Note
1. Reorganization and Line of Business

On October
5
 2010 Time Associates
 a Nevada corporation (&#34; the Company&#34;) acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock
of Healthient
 Inc.
 a Nevada corporation organized April 29
 2009 (&#34;Healthient&#34;) in exchange for the issuance by the
Company of a total of 43
618
356 newly issued restricted shares of common voting stock to the Healthient shareholders pursuant
the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of September 23
 2010. Prior to the issuance of the shares
 the Company had
160
078 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Subsequent to the exchange there were 43
778
434 shares issued and outstanding.
The shareholders of Healthient owned 99.6% of the common stock outstanding of the Company after the issuance of the 43
618
356
shares. On November 15
 2010 Time Associates
 Inc. name was changed to Healthient
 Inc.

The acquisition
of Healthient by the Company on October 5
 2010 has been accounted for as a purchase and treated as a reverse acquisition and
re-capitalization since the former owners of Healthient controlled 99.6% of the total shares of Common Stock of the Company outstanding
immediately following the acquisition. In November 2010 Healthient
 Inc. changed its name to SnackHealthy
 Inc.

On this
basis
 the historical financial statements prior to October 5
 2010 have been restated to be those of the accounting acquirer
Healthient (now SnackHealthy
 Inc.). The historical stockholders' equity prior to the reverse acquisition has been retroactively
restated (a re-capitalization) for the equivalent number of shares received in the acquisition after giving effect to any difference
in par value of the issuer's and acquirer's stock. The original 160
078 shares of common stock outstanding prior to the exchange
reorganization have been reflected as an addition in the stockholders' equity account of the Company on October 5
 2010.

Healthient
Inc.
 and its wholly owned subsidiary
 SnackHealthy
 Inc.
 develop and market snacks and beverages with the objective of making
healthy eating a fun experience for the entire family. The Company&#146;s goal is to develop a portfolio of products and successfully
position them as convenient
 healthy solutions across several snacking occasions daily. The Company sold snacks through a network
marketing distribution model until the third quarter of the year ended June 30
 2013 when it started marketing direct to retail
stores and markets. &#160;

The Company
was in the Development Stage as defined in Accounting Standards Codified (ASC) No. 915
 &#147;Accounting and Reporting by Development
Stage Enterprises&#148; through June 30
 2011.&#160;&#160;The Company had devoted substantially all of its efforts to the corporate
formation. Activities during the Development Stage include developing the business plan and raising capital. The Company is now
in operations.
