Item 1.  Business
     Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K Lone Star Gold
 Inc. is referred
to as we, our, us, the Company, or Lone Star.
     The Company  was formed as a Nevada  corporation  on  November  26
 2007 as
Keyser  Resources
  Inc. On June 14
 2011
 the Company  changed its name to Lone
Star Gold
  Inc. The Company has been inactive  since  September 30
 2013. As of
December 31
 2013 all of the  Company's  projects  regarding La  Candelaria  and
Chihuahua
  Mexico (the  Tailings  Project)  were  abandoned  and all  contracts
incident to those projects expired and or were terminated.
     The  Company  was  involved  in  exploration   and  development  of  mining
properties until September 30
 2013 when it discontinued operations.  In June of
2017
 the Company's  creditors  filed a petition in the District Court of Harris
County
  Texas for the  appointment  of a  receiver.  In August of 2017
  Angela
Collette was appointed receiver pursuant to the petition. In connection with the
receivership
  Ms. Collette was appointed  President
  Secretary
  Treasurer and
Director of the Company.  In February 2018 Ms. Collette appointed William Alessi
as a director of the Company and then  resigned as a director and officer of the
Company.
     On November  28
 2018 the Company  entered into an agreement to acquire all
of  the  issued  and  outstanding  shares  of  Infinity
   Inc.  for  60
000
000
(post-split) shares of the Company's common stock.
     The  acquisition  of Infinity is  contingent  upon a number of  conditions
including:
     o    FINRA's approval of a 100-for-1  reverse split of the Company's common
          stock
 and
     o    the  Company's  acquisition  of Good Hemp Living
  Inc. for  9
154
615
          (post-split) shares of the Company's common stock.
     Infinity  is  focused  on the  acquisition  and  management  of  vertically
integrated  companies in the regulated  recreational  and  medical-use  cannabis
industry.
     Infinity  currently  operates  under  a City  of  San  Diego  Business  Tax
Certificate  that allows  processing  and packaging of medical  marijuana  until
12/31/2019.  This allows  Infinity to operate  under Prop215 until a Conditional
Use Permit (CUP) is granted. Infinity is in Cycle 8 of 10 cycles with the City
of San Diego CUP process under San Diego Ordinance O-20858 which allows Infinity
to operate a  marijuana  manufacturing-processing
  packaging  and  distribution
facility in accordance with San Diego Municipal Code section 141.1004.
     Infinity also markets a line of disposable vape pens
 CBD lotions
  CBD/THC
pain salves
 and CBD teas.
     For the nine month period ended September 30
 2018 Infinity had revenues of
$4
531
775 and net income of $17
112.
     Good Hemp Living
  Inc. is a company  involved in developing a line of hemp
based  consumer  goods.  Good Hemp Living

                                       4

Emerging Growth Company Status
     We are an emerging  growth  company as defined  under the  Jumpstart  Our
Business  Startups Act
  commonly referred to as the JOBS Act. We will remain an
emerging growth company for up to five years
 or until the earliest of (i) the
last day of the  first  fiscal  year in which our total  annual  gross  revenues
exceed $1 billion
  (ii) the date that we become a large  accelerated filer as
defined in Rule 12b-2 under the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934
  which would
occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by  non-affiliates
exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently  completed
second  fiscal  quarter or (iii) the date on which we have  issued  more than $1
billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.
     As  an  emerging  growth  company,  we  may  take  advantage  of  certain
exemptions  from various  reporting  requirements  that are  applicable to other
public companies that are not emerging  growth  companies  including
  but not
limited to:
     o    not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements
          of  section  404(b)  of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act (we also  will not be
          subject to the auditor  attestation  requirements of Section 404(b) as
          long as we are a smaller  reporting  company, which includes issuers
          that  had a  public  float of less  than  $75  million  as of the last
          business day of their most recently completed second fiscal quarter);
     o    reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our
          periodic reports and proxy statements; and
     o    exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote
          on  executive  compensation  and  shareholder  approval  of any golden
          parachute payments not previously approved.
     In addition
  Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth
company  can take  advantage  of the  extended  transition  period  provided in
Section  7(a)(2)(B)  of the  Securities  Act for  complying  with new or revised
accounting  standards.  Under this provision
  an emerging  growth company can
delay the adoption of certain  accounting  standards until those standards would
otherwise  apply to private  companies.  In other  words
  an  emerging  growth
company  can  delay the  adoption  of such  accounting  standards  until  those
standards would otherwise apply to private companies until the first to occur of
the date the subject  company (i) is no longer an emerging  growth  company or
(ii)  affirmatively  and irrevocably opts out of the extended  transition period
provided in Securities Act Section 7(a) (2) (B). The Company has elected to take
advantage of this  extended  transition  period and
 as a result
  our financial
statements  may not be comparable  to the  financial  statements of other public
companies. Accordingly
 until the date that we are no longer an emerging growth
company or affirmatively  and irrevocably opt out of the exemption  provided by
Securities  Act  Section  7(a) (2) (B)
  upon the  issuance  of a new or revised
accounting  standard  that  applies  to  your  financial  statements  and  has a
different effective date for public and private companies
  clarify that we will
disclose  the  date on  which  adoption  is  required  for  non-emerging  growth
companies  and the date on which we will adopt the  recently  issued  accounting
standard.

     Holders of our common  stock are  entitled to receive  dividends  as may be
declared by the Board of  Directors.  The  Company's  Board of  Directors is not
restricted from paying any dividends but is not obligated to declare a dividend.
No cash  dividends have ever been declared and it is not  anticipated  that cash
dividends will ever be paid.
                                       6

     The Company's Articles of Incorporation authorize the Board of Directors to
issue up to 30
000
000 shares of preferred stock. The provisions in the Articles
of  Incorporation  relating  to the  preferred  stock allow  directors  to issue
preferred  stock with multiple  votes per share and dividend  rights which would
have  priority  over any  dividends  paid with  respect to the holders of common
stock. The issuance of preferred stock with these rights may make the removal of
management  difficult  even if the removal  would be  considered  beneficial  to
shareholders  generally
  and  will  have the  effect  of  limiting  shareholder
participation in certain  transactions such as mergers or tender offers if these
transactions are not favored by our management.
     As of
 November 30
 2018
 the Company had 143
261
963 outstanding shares of
common stock which were owned by approximately 20 shareholders of record.

Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures.
     An  evaluation  was  carried  out  under  the   supervision  and  with  the
participation of our management
 including our Principal Executive and Financial
Officers of the  effectiveness  of our disclosure  controls and procedures as of
                                       7

the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-K.  Disclosure  controls
and  procedures  are  procedures  designed  with the  objective of ensuring that
information  required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the  Securities
Exchange Act of 1934
 such as this Form 10-K
 is recorded
 processed
 summarized
and reported
  within the time period  specified in the  Securities and Exchange
Commission's  rules and forms
  and that such  information is accumulated and is
communicated to our management
  including our Principal Executive and Financial
Officers
  or persons  performing similar  functions
  as appropriate
  to allow
timely decisions regarding required  disclosure.  Based on that evaluation
  our
management  concluded that
 as of December 31
 2013
 our disclosure controls and
procedures  were not  effective.  A  controls  system  cannot  provide  absolute
assurance
  however
  that the objectives of the controls system are met
 and no
evaluation of controls can provide  absolute  assurance  that all control issues
and instances of fraud
 if any
 within a company have been detected.
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
     The Company's  management is responsible for  establishing  and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the
effectiveness  of internal control over financial  reporting.  As defined by the
Securities and Exchange Commission
 internal control over financial reporting is
a process  designed  by
 or under the  supervision  of the  company's  Principal
Executive  and  Financial  Officers and  implemented  by its Board of Directors
management and other personnel
  to provide reasonable  assurance  regarding the
reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  our  financial
statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
     Because  of its  inherent  limitations
  internal  control  over  financial
reporting  may not prevent or detect  misstatements.  Also
  projections  of any
evaluation  of  effectiveness  to future  periods  are  subject to the risk that
controls may become  inadequate  because of changes in  conditions
  or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
     The Company's  Principal  Executive and  Financial  Officers  evaluated the
effectiveness  of its internal  control over financial  reporting as of December
31
  2013
  based on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control -  Integrated
Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations  of the Treadway
Commission
  or the COSO Framework (2013).  Management's  assessment included an
evaluation of the design of our internal  control over  financial  reporting and
testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls.
     Based on this evaluation
  management concluded that the Company's internal
control over financial  reporting was not effective as of December 31
 2013. Due
to the following:
     o    the lack of formal written documentation relating to the design of the
          Company's controls.
     o    the Company did not maintain adequate segregation of duties related to
          job  responsibilities  for initiating
  authorizing
  and recording of
          certain transactions due to the small size of our company.
     o    the Company does not have  sufficient  personnel  to provide  adequate
          risk assessment functions.
     Notwithstanding  the  above
  a controls  system  cannot  provide  absolute
assurance that the objectives of the controls  system are met
 and no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud
  if any
  within a company  have been  detected.  Changes in  Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting
                                       8

     There  was no change  in the  Company's  internal  control  over  financial
reporting  that  occurred  during the period  covered  by this  report  that has
materially affected
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect
 the Company's
internal control over financial reporting.

                  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors of
Lone Star Gold
 Inc.
(An Exploration Stage Company)
Albuquerque
 New Mexico
We have audited the accompanying  consolidated balance sheets of Lone Star Gold
Inc.  (the  Company)  as of December  31
 2012
  and the related  consolidated
statements of operations
 shareholders' equity (deficit)
 and cash flows for the
year then ended. These consolidated  financial statements are the responsibility
of the  Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to express an opinion on
these financial  statements based on our audits. We did not audit the statements
of operations
 stockholders' deficit and cash flows for the period from November
26
 2007  (inception) to December 31
 2009
  which totals reflected a deficit of
$107
017  accumulated during the exploration  stage. Those financial  statements
and  cumulative  totals were audited by other  auditors whose report dated April
12
 2010
  expressed an unqualified  opinion on those  statements and cumulative
totals
 and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company's ability to
continue  as a going  concern.  Our  opinion
  insofar  as it relates to amounts
included for that period is based on the report of other  independent  auditors
mentioned above.
We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements  are free of material  misstatement.  The Company is not  required to
have
  nor were we engaged to perform
  an audit of its  internal  control  over
financial reporting.  Our audits included consideration of internal control over
financial  reporting  as  a  basis  for  designing  audit  procedures  that  are
appropriate  in the  circumstances
  but not for the  purpose of  expressing  an
opinion on the  effectiveness  of the Company's  internal control over financial
reporting.  Accordingly
  we express  no such  opinion.  An audit also  includes
examining
  on a test basis
  evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the  financial   statements
   assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and
significant  estimates  made by  management
  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our audit and the report of
the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion
  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly
 in
all material  respects
  the consolidated  financial position of Lone Star Gold
Inc. as of December 31
  2012
  and the results of its  operations  and its cash
flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated  financial statements
  the Company's
absence of significant revenues
  recurring losses from operations
 and its need
for  additional  financing  in order to fund its  projected  loss in 2013  raise
substantial  doubt about its ability to  continue as a going  concern.  The 2012
consolidated  financial  statements  do not include any  adjustments  that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 2013
NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND DISCONTINUANCE OF BUSIENSS
Lone Star Gold
  Inc. (the  Company or Lone Star)
  formerly known as Keyser
Resources
  Inc.
 was  incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 26
 2007.
The Company is an Exploration  Stage Company as defined by Financial  Accounting
Standards Board Accounting Standards  Codification (ASC) Topic 915 Development
Stage Entities.
On January 26
 2012
 the Company
 acting through a subsidiary
  Amiko Kay
 S. de
R.L.  de C.V.
  a company  organized  under the laws of  Mexico  (Amiko  Kay)
entered into a Joint Venture  Agreement (the JV  Agreement)  with Miguel Angel
Jaramillo  Tapia  (Jaramillo)
  a resident of Mexico.  Under the JV Agreement
Amiko Kay and Jaramillo  agreed to process mine tailings  located in the city of
Hidalgo  Del Parral in the state of  Chihuahua
  Mexico (the  Tailings)
  and
after  processing
  to use
  market  and sell any  minerals  extracted  from the
Tailings.  The  Company  owns  99%  of the  issued  and  outstanding  membership
interests of Amiko Kay. The JV Agreement provides Amiko Kay the right to receive
65% of the net  revenues  from  the  sale of any  materials  extracted  from the
Tailings. The Company is accounting for the activities under the JV Agreement as
a  collaborative  arrangement  as defined by ASC 808.  As a result
  acquisition
costs  related  to  the  JV  Agreement  have  been  capitalized  and  all  other
expenditures  by the Company  related to the JV Agreement  have been expensed as
incurred as exploration  costs. This is in accordance with the Company's Mineral
Property Cost Accounting Policy.
Shortly after  September  30
 2013
  the Company  ceased  operation as it was in
default of certain creditor  obligations.  The Company was put into receivership
to satisfy outstanding judgment creditor claims.
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a) Non-controlling Interests
Non-controlling  interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable
directly or indirectly to the Company
  and in represented  in the  consolidated
balance sheets as a component of stockholders' equity. Non-controlling interests
in the results of  operations  of the Company are  presented  in the face of the
statement of  operations  as an  allocation  of the total profit or loss between
non-controlling interests and the shareholders of the Company.
(b) Basis of Presentation
These  financial  statements and related notes are presented in accordance  with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
 and are expressed
in US dollars. The Company's fiscal year-end is December 31.
(c) Use of Estimates
The  preparation  of financial  statements  in  conformity  with U.S.  generally
accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and
assumptions  that  affect the  reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities  and
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting  period.  The Company  regularly  evaluates  estimates and assumptions
related to the recoverability of long-lived assets and deferred income tax asset
valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current
facts
  historical  experience  and various other factors that it believes to be
reasonable  under the  circumstances
  the  results  of which form the basis for
making  judgments  about the carrying  values of assets and  liabilities and the
accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily  apparent from other sources.
The  actual  results  experienced  by the  Company  may  differ  materially  and
adversely  from the  Company's  estimates.  To the  extent  there  are  material
differences  between the estimates  and the actual  results
  future  results of
operations will be affected.
(d) Net Loss Per Common Share
The Company  computes  net income or loss per share in  accordance  with ASC 260
Earnings per Share.  Under the  provisions  of the Earnings per Share Topic ASC
basic net loss per share is  computed  by  dividing  the net loss  available  to
common  stockholders  for the period by the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding  during the period. The calculation of diluted net loss
per share gives effect to common stock  equivalents;  however
  potential common
shares are  excluded  if their  effect is  anti-dilutive.
                                       F-7

  (e) Income  Taxes
The Company  accounts  for its income  taxes in  accordance  with ASC 740 Income
Taxes
  which requires  recognition of deferred tax assets and  liabilities  for
future tax  consequences  attributable  to  differences  between  the  financial
statement  carrying  amounts  of  existing  assets  and  liabilities  and  their
respective  tax bases and tax credit  carry  forwards.  Deferred  tax assets and
liabilities  are measured  using enacted tax rates  expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which  those  temporary  differences  are  expected to be
recovered  or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and  liabilities  of a
change in tax rates is  recognized in operations in the period that includes the
enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax
assets  that would  otherwise  be  recorded  for income tax  benefits  primarily
relating to operating loss  carryforwards as realization cannot be determined to
be more likely than not.
The statement establishes a  more-likely-than-not  threshold for recognizing the
benefits  of  tax  return  positions  in the  financial  statements.  Also
  the
statement  implements a process for measuring those tax positions which meet the
recognition  threshold of being  ultimately  sustained  upon  examination by the
taxing authorities. There are no uncertain tax positions taken by the Company on
its tax returns and the adoption of the statement had no material  impact to the
Company's  consolidated  financial statements.  The Company files tax returns in
the US and states in which it has  operations  and is subject to  taxation.  Tax
years  subsequent to 2013 remain open to examination  by U.S.  federal and state
tax jurisdictions.
(f) Discontinued operations
We  discontinued  operations  during  the year  ended  December  31
  2013.  All
operations  prior to that have been presented in the statement of operations and
the cash flow statement as net income or loss from discontinued  operations.  In
fact we had no assets  related to an  operating  business as December  31
 2017
2016
 2015
 2014 or 2013.
NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN
The  Company  has elected to adopt early  application  of  Accounting  Standards
Update  No.  2014-15
