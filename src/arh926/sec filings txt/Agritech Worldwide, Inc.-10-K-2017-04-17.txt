&rdquo; &ldquo;estimates
&rdquo; and similar expressions.


These
statements are based on our current beliefs

statements in this Annual Report will prove to be accurate. Furthermore
 if our forward-looking statements prove to be inaccurate
the inaccuracy may be material. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements
 you should not

PART
I



ITEM
    
    




On
April 5
 2017
 we and GKS Funding LLC
 as administrative agent under the Loan Agreement (as defined below) (&ldquo;GKS Funding&rdquo;)
entered into a Cooperation Agreement (the &ldquo;Cooperation Agreement&rdquo;) in connection with a loan (the &ldquo;Loan&rdquo;)
made to us pursuant to that certain Loan and Security Agreement
 dated as of February 1
 2017 (as amended and in effect from time
to time
 the &ldquo;Loan Agreement&rdquo;)
 between us
 the Lenders party thereto and GKS Funding. On March 31
 2017
 we received
a notice of default from GKS Funding stating that we were in default of the Loan for failure to make a scheduled interest payment
on the Loan that was due on March 31
 2017. If such failure described above was not cured within the 15-day cure period
 which
was April 15
 2017
 the Lenders (through GKS Funding
 as administrative agent under the Loan Agreement) intended to exercise all
rights and remedies available to them under the Loan Agreement
 related note and applicable law
 which included foreclosing on
the collateral under the Loan Agreement.

As
of the date of the Cooperation Agreement
 the outstanding balance of our obligations under the Loan Agreement was approximately
$1
011
800
 plus accrued and accruing legal fees and expenses. Over the past several months
 we have experienced significant operating
losses and have been unable to raise additional capital in order to pay the expenses necessary to continue to operate its business.
For the same reason
 we were unable to pay interest on the Loan on March 31
 2017 (the &ldquo;Existing Default&rdquo;).

As
a result of the foregoing
 and after considering all options
 our Board of Directors determined that we would not have sufficient
funds to cure the Existing Default on or before April 15
 2017. In addition
 given our inability to raise additional capital to
fund ongoing operations
 we also determined that we would be unable to continue to operate as a going concern. Thus
 we determined
that it was in the best interests of all constituents that we cooperate with GKS Funding and its exercise of remedies.

Pursuant
to the Cooperation Agreement
 we and GKS Funding agreed as follows: (i) we waived the 15-day cure period with respect to the Existing
Default immediately upon execution of the Cooperation Letter and GKS Funding has the right to exercise its remedies under the
Loan Agreement and applicable law with respect to such event of default
 including
 without limitation
 by scheduling and conducting
a sale of all of the collateral under the Loan Agreement on or about April 17
 2017 (the &ldquo;UCC Sale&rdquo;); (ii) GKS Funding
agreed to fund loans to us up to the date of the UCC Sale to permit us to pay the Budgeted Expenses (as defined in the Cooperation
Agreement) as and when due with this new loan
 which is (a) secured by a first priority security interest in all of our real and
personal assets
 property
 fixtures
 rights and interests
 (b) shall have priority in payment over the Loan made pursuant to the
Loan Agreement; and (c) shall be repaid
 before any other payments are made by us
 out of the first cash proceeds of the collateral
received by us; and (iii) we consented to fully cooperate with GKS Funding in connection with the UCC Sale
 as well as the exercise
by GKS Funding of any of its other right and remedies in connection therewith.

In
light of the foregoing
 we do not anticipate that we will be able to continue in our current line of business. At this point
the Board is reevaluating its business plan and strategy and has not made any determination as to whether or not it will seek
to engage in a new line of business.

During
the past year
 our sole operations were as an agricultural technology company. The products and processes that we owned and are
being foreclosed upon by GKS Funding convert generally available agricultural by-products into multi-functional all-natural ingredients
that can be used in food manufacturing and other industries. Our primary focus and the source of substantially all of our revenue
during the past several years has been from the sale of our all-natural products
 Z Trim&reg;
 to the food industry. Our business
involved the sale of a line of all-natural products to the food industry designed to help manufacturers reduce their costs
 improve
the quality of finished goods
 and solve many production problems.



During
the year ended December 31
 2016
 our core product portfolio was comprised of multifunctional food ingredients that included Corn
Z Trim&reg; (both GMO and non-GMO) and Oat Z Trim&reg;. The superior water-holding capacity and amorphous structure of Z Trim
ingredients are key to the exclusive multifunctional attributes they contribute to food product design
 including moisture management
oil deflection
 texture and appearance quality
 fat and calorie reduction. These attributes allow manufacturers using such products
to reduce costs of finished products by replacing more expensive ingredients with our fiber and water.&nbsp;&nbsp;Z Trim&reg;
is now being used by food manufacturers world-wide
 across a multitude of food categories
 such as meats
 sauces
 soups
 dressings
baked goods
 fillings
 toppings
 prepared meals
 dairy products
 frozen handheld snacks
 and pizza dough. Food formulators are
seeking greater functionality and product performance than they can get from starches
 gums
 fats
 and other fibers &ndash; for
both standard and lower fat content foods - and Z Trim&reg; multifunctional ingredients can help to satisfy their consumers with
finished products that we believe have enhanced eating quality
 outstanding product performance
 and frequently
 improved nutritional
profiles.


    
    


Product
Distribution

Our
food ingredients had been marketed through (i) direct and brokered sales to major food manufacturers
 as well as small and midsize
companies for packaged retail foods
 and (ii) direct and brokered sales to large and small foodservice manufacturers that supply
to restaurants
 hospitals
 schools and cafeterias. In addition to direct sales
 we used a network of ingredient distributors
both domestic and international
 to distribute our products.



Z
Trim&reg; ingredients have competed with a wide variety of hydrocolloids and other fiber ingredients.&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the food
industry
 depending on the food application
 required functional properties and product development objectives
 competitive ingredients
included gums (e.g.
 guar
 xanthan
 locust bean
 and Arabic)
 seaweed extracts (e.g.
 alginates
 carrageenan)
 starches (native
modified and resistant)
 and fibers (e.g.
 oat bran
 corn bran
 pea fiber
 potato fiber).&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of these competitive
ingredients are well-established in the food industry
 and many of the companies that supply them have substantially greater resources
than we do.&nbsp;&nbsp;However
 we believe that the unique properties of our multifunctional fiber ingredients provide differentiation
and growth opportunities for food companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that no other single hydrocolloid or fiber has the combined
water holding and binding capacity that is effective across as wide a pH and temperature range as Z Trim&reg;
 and that Z Trim&reg;
ingredients can have synergistic effects with other hydrocolloids and fibers
 allowing food manufacturers to achieve greater processing
improvements
 cost efficiencies
 and finished product performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the same ingredients used in foods are also
used for industrial applications
 where they compete with a similar complement of ingredients.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sources
and Availability of Raw Materials and the Names of Principal Suppliers

Raw
materials used in Z Trim&reg; products are sourced principally in the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 70% of the raw materials
consist of corn bran and oat hulls
 which are generally available from a variety of suppliers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our major suppliers
included Agricor
 Inc. and Brenntag
 Inc.

Dependence
on a Few Major Customers

Our
customers have been predominantly food manufacturers.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were three significant customers who accounted for 34%
12% and 7%
 respectively
 of total sales for the year ended December 31
 2016. There were three significant customers who accounted
for 45%
 10% and 6%
 respectively
 of total sales for the year ended December 31
 2015. The loss of any of these three customers
we believe would have a material adverse effect on our revenue.

Intellectual
Property

Our
intangible assets included patents pending and issued
 as well as trade secrets and know how. Through the process of development
and commercialization of&nbsp;our technology
 we had identified and sought patent protection for improvements to the manufacturing
process and product applications.&nbsp;


pledged as collateral to GKS Funding and we expect will be sold by GKS Funding when they sell the collateral on April 17
 2017.


On
December 1
 2009
 we were issued U.S. Patent No. 7
625
591 B2; which expires in 2026 subject to the payment of maintenance fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;On
July 27
 2010
 we were issued U.S. Patent No. 7
763
301; which will expire in 2027 subject to payment of maintenance fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;These
patents expanded the raw material sources for the creation of Z Trim products as well as incorporate blends of ingredients combined
with Z Trim.&nbsp;&nbsp;

In
March 2013 we
 jointly with the USDA
 filed a utility patent for our BioFiber Gum line of products
 seeking patent protection
for the composition of matter
 process for making
 as well as applications for
 our proprietary soluble fibers (application number:
PCT/US2014/0017376). In January 2015 the USDA commended global filings outside of the United States. On September 6
 2016
 U.S.
Patent No. 9
434
788 B2 was issued which expired in 2032 subject to the payment of maintenance fees.

We
have four additional utility patents on file that cover composition
 process and various applications of Z Trim and BioFiber Gum
each filed jointly with the USDA and pledged as collateral to GKS.


    
    



Government
Regulation

As
an agricultural technology company
 we have been subject to a broad range of federal
 state
 local and foreign laws and regulations
intended to protect public health and the environment. Food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal
state
 local
 and foreign agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;However
 as ingredients are made from natural raw material sources (corn and oat)
they are considered Generally Recognized As Safe or &ldquo;GRAS&rdquo;&nbsp;and therefore not subject to many of the regulations
applicable to foods.

In
October 2012
 the FDA approved the labeling of the products that we have sold in meat applications. Specifically
 the FDA has
approved the use of the ingredients in ground
 emulsified
 and processed meats and poultry.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Research
and Development


 in conjunction with
our customers and strategic industry partners
 including the USDA
 has worked on the development of additional products and applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;In
June 2011
 we entered into a 3-year agreement with the USDA to conduct joint research for the development of additional products
and processes relating to our current patented products. This agreement was amended and the duration extended through May 31
2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2017
 we entered into a new 3-year agreement with the USDA to conduct joint research for the development
of additional products and processes relating to our current patented products. We require all employees and visitors to our plant
to execute a non-disclosure agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;Research and Development expense was $10
817 in the year ended December 31
2016 and $181
713 in the year ended December 31
 2015.


Environmental
Compliance



environmental compliance issues as a result of our manufacturing process
 however there can be no assurances that we will continue
to comply in the future or that any future business we enter into will comply.




 we have 14 full-time employees; however
 that
is expected to change after GSK Funding forecloses on our assets.

Our
History

We
were originally incorporated in the State of Illinois on May 5
 1994 under the original name Circle Group Entertainment Ltd.&nbsp;&nbsp;On
June 21
 2006
 we filed a certificate of amendment to our certificate of incorporation and changed our name to Z Trim Holdings
Inc. On March 23
 2016
 we changed our state of incorporation by engaging in a merger (the &ldquo;Reincorporation&rdquo;) with
and into our newly formed wholly owned subsidiary
 Agritech Worldwide
 Inc.
 a Nevada corporation
 pursuant to the terms and conditions
of an Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into by Z Trim and Agritech on March 18
 2016 (the &ldquo;Merger Agreement&rdquo;).&nbsp;
The Reincorporation was consummated on March 23
 2016 and was effectuated by the filing of (i) articles of merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of Nevada
 and (ii) articles of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Illinois. The Reincorporation
effected a change in our legal domicile form Illinois to Nevada. Upon the effectiveness of the Reincorporation our affairs of
ceased to be governed by (i) Illinois corporation laws
 (ii) our Articles of Incorporation
 and (iii) our Bylaws
 and our affairs
became subject to (a) Nevada corporation laws
 (b) Agritech&rsquo;s Articles of Incorporation of and (c) Agritech&rsquo;s Bylaws.
The resulting Nevada corporation is (i) be deemed to be the same entity as the Illinois corporation for all purposes under the
laws of Nevada
 (ii) continue to have all of the rights
 privileges and powers of the Illinois corporation
 (iii) continue to
possess all properties of the Illinois corporation
 and (iv) continues to have all of the debts
 liabilities and obligations of
the Illinois corporation.

ITEM
Legal
                                         Proceedings.

In
July 2007
 we were sued in the 20th Judicial Circuit Court
 St. Clair County
 Illinois by Joseph Sanfilippo and James Cluck for
violation of the Consumer Fraud Act and they are seeking damages in excess of $200
000.&nbsp;&nbsp;The trial court has issued
a default order against us
 and has denied our motion to reconsider.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management believes that the trial court&rsquo;s
rulings were erroneous and that it has grounds for appeal
 and that the underlying allegations are frivolous and wholly without
merit. We intend to vigorously defend the claim. The outcome of this matter is unknown as of the report date.&nbsp;&nbsp;However
we have conservatively allocated a reserve of $102
000 to satisfy any liability it may incur as a result of this proceeding. The
status at December 31
 2016 has remained the same.

Although
there can be no assurances
 based on the information currently available
 management believes that it is probable that the ultimate
outcome of this action will not have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;However
 an adverse outcome
could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the period in which it is recorded.

Management&rsquo;s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.


This Management&rsquo;s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward-looking
statements are subject to risks
 uncertainties and assumptions which could cause actual results to differ materially from those
projected.


The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated
financial statements in Item 8
 &ldquo;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
&rdquo; in Part II of this report.




 2016
our revenue was derived from the sale of products and processes that convert generally available agricultural by-products into
multi-functional all-natural ingredients that can be used in food manufacturing and other industries. GKS Funding has stated that
it intends to sell the collateral securing its loan
 which includes all of our assets
 on April 17
 2017. The results of operations
set forth below will not be meaningful in evaluating our company&rsquo;s future operations since we do not anticipate being able
to remain in our current line of business after the foreclosure.



    
    


Going
Concern

We
incurred a net loss of $3
155
361 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2016
 and had an accumulated deficit of $159
584
991.&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of December 31
 2016
 we had cash in the amount of $20
773 and total liabilities in the amount of $6
769
089. We also had a working
capital deficit of $6
614
632 as of December 31
 2016. Over the last several years
 our operations have been funded primarily
through the sale of both equity and debt securities. Inasmuch as we are still evaluating our future strategy
 it is difficult
for us to estimate our future operating needs.&nbsp;&nbsp; As of the date of our most recent audit
 for the fiscal year ended
December 31
 2016
 we had not generated sufficient revenues to meet our cash flow needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current cash on hand is
insufficient for us to be able to maintain our operations at the current level through May 2017 and due to the outstanding debt
owed
 we do not anticipate that we have the assets from which to continue our current operations. As a result
 our auditors have
expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have generated revenue
 we
are still operating at a net loss
 and may continue to incur losses for a period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot assure you that
we will be able to obtain sufficient funds from our operating or financing activities to support our continued operations especially
since our continued operations have not yet been determined.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we cannot continue as a going concern
 and cannot successfully
revise our business plan we will need to cease operations
 which will reduce or completely eliminate the value of your investment.



We
were originally incorporated in the State of Illinois on May 5
 1994 under the name Circle Group Entertainment Ltd. On June 21
2006
 we filed a certificate of amendment to our certificate of incorporation and changed our name to Z Trim Holdings Inc. On
March 23
 2016
 we changed our state of incorporation by engaging in a merger (the &ldquo;Reincorporation&rdquo;) with and into
our newly formed wholly owned subsidiary
 Agritech Worldwide
 Inc.
 a Nevada corporation
 pursuant to the terms and conditions
of an Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into by Z Trim and Agritech on March 18
 2016 (the &ldquo;Merger Agreement&rdquo;).
The Reincorporation was consummated on March 23
 2016 and was effectuated by the filing of (i) articles of merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of Nevada
 and (ii) articles of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Illinois. The Reincorporation
effected a change in our legal domicile from Illinois to Nevada. Upon the effectiveness of the Reincorporation our affairs of
ceased to be governed by (i) Illinois corporation laws
 (ii) our Illinois Articles of Incorporation
 and (iii) our Illinois Bylaws
and our affairs became subject to (a) Nevada corporation laws
 (b) Agritech&rsquo;s Articles of Incorporation of and (c) Agritech&rsquo;s
Bylaws. The resulting Nevada corporation is (i) be deemed to be the same entity as the Illinois corporation for all purposes under
the laws of Nevada
 (ii) continue to have all of the rights
 privileges and powers of the Illinois corporation
 (iii) continue
to possess all properties of the Illinois corporation
 and (iv) continues to have all of the debts
 liabilities and obligations
of the Illinois corporation.

Sales
and Manufacturing

Revenues
for the year ended December 31
 2016 increased by 2.3% as compared to revenues for the year ended December 31
 2015.

Equipment
Sale and Leaseback


 2015
 we entered into an equipment
purchase agreement (the &ldquo;Purchase Agreement&rdquo;) with Fordham Capital Partners
 LLC (&ldquo;Fordham&rdquo;) pursuant
to which we sold all of our right
 title and interest in production equipment utilized by the Company to Fordham for a purchase
price of $500
000. Concurrently with entering into the Purchase Agreement
 on July 17
 2015
 we entered into an equipment lease
agreement (the &ldquo;Equipment Lease Agreement&rdquo;) with Fordham pursuant to which we leased the production equipment from
Fordham on terms that included the following: a lease term of 24 months
 monthly lease payments by the Company of $15
800 and
the option (at the election of the Company) to purchase the equipment on or after July 8
 2016 on the following terms: (i) if
the purchase date is between 12- 18 months $425
000; (ii) if the purchase date is between 19- 23 months: $360
000; and (iii) if
the purchase date is during the 24th month (but no later than July 8
 2017): $325
000. We received net proceeds of $172
911 from
the Purchase Agreement. The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.


In
connection with the Purchase Agreement
 the Company&rsquo;s Factoring Agreement with Fordham effective May 28
 2015
 as amended
by an amendment dated June 25
 2015
 was further amended to grant to Fordham a security interest in all of the collateral under
such agreement to secure the payment to Fordham of all rent payments and all other amounts owed by the Company to Fordham under
the Equipment Lease Agreement.


    
    



On
February 1
 2017
 we used a portion of the proceeds of a loan from GKS Funding to exercise our purchase option under the Equipment
Lease Agreement. The production equipment has been pledged to GKS Funding as collateral and we anticipate it will be sold when
GKS Funding exercises its remedies under the Loan Agreement.

Results
of Operations



Revenue
for the year ended December 31
 2016 was $1
177
344
 as compared to revenue of $1
151
190 for the year ended December 31
 2015
an increase of 2%.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our revenue for both years was entirely attributable to product sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in
sales was due to an increase in product volume shipped to customers. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to generate
any revenue once GKS forecloses on our assets.

Our
revenues

Cost
of Revenues

Cost
of revenues for products sold for the year ended December 31
 2016 and 2015 was $1
803
509 and $2
055
825
 respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
decrease in costs of goods sold in 2016 of approximately 12% was attributable to production improvements in our own pilot facility.

Gross
Margin Income (Loss)

Gross
margin loss for the year ended December 31
 2016 was $626
165 compared to a gross margin loss of $904
635 for the prior year.
The decreased loss for 2016 was a result of production improvements in our manufacturing facility in Mundelein
 Illinois.

Operating
Expenses

Total
operating expenses for the year ended December 31
 2016 were $2
027
493 a decrease of $1
649
020 or approximately 45% lower than
the comparable period ended December 31
 2015 of $3

The
decrease in salary and employee benefits for the year ended December 31
 2016 is attributable to fewer employees. Stock based
compensation was higher than a year ago as a result of additional grants including to our Chief Executive Officer.


    
    



Operating
Loss


31
 2016 was $2
653
658 compared to $4
581
148 for the year ended December 31
 2015 due to the reasons described above.

Other
Expense

Other
expenses were $501
703 for the year ended December 31
 2016 compared to $19
395
283 in the year ended December 31
 2015. The primary
reason for the change was due to the higher warrant-related expenses in 2015.&nbsp;

Net
Loss

As
a result of the foregoing
 we incurred a net loss of $3
155
361 for the year ended December 31
 2016
 or $0.03 per share
 compared
to $23
976
431 for the year ended December 31
 2015
 or $0.41 per share.

The
decrease in the net loss per share for the year ended December 31
 2015
 as compared to the year ended December 31
 2014 was due
to the effect of the results described above partially offset by the number of the additional shares outstanding in 2015.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources


 2016
 we had a cash
balance of $20
773
 a decrease of $289
078 from the cash balance of $309
851 at December 31
 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31
2016
 we had a working capital deficit of $6
614
632
 an increase in deficit from the working capital deficit of $3
801
651 as
of December 31
 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference in working capital was primarily because of an increase in accounts payable
 an
increase in short term borrowings and notes payable and an increase in accrued liabilities during 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;As of April
11
 2017
 we had a cash balance of $41
821.




 our
operations have been funded primarily through revenue generated from operations and the sale of both equity and debt
securities. We continue to explore additional lines of business to enter into and equity and debt funding however
 there can
be no assurance that we will be successful in raising all of the additional funding that we are seeking or that such amount
will be sufficient for our needs. As of the date of our most recent audit
 for the fiscal year ended December 31
 2016
 we
had not generated sufficient revenues to meet our cash flow needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current cash on hand is insufficient for us
to be able to maintain our operations at the current level through May 2017. As a result
 our auditors have expressed
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have generated revenue
 we are
still operating at a net loss
 and may continue to incur losses for a period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot assure you that we
will be able to obtain sufficient funds from our operating or financing activities to support our continued
operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we cannot continue as a going concern
 we will need to substantially revise our business plan or
cease operations
 which will reduce or completely eliminate the value of your investment.


 2017
 we and GKS Funding
entered into the Cooperation Agreement in connection with the Loan made to us pursuant to that certain Loan Agreement
 between
us
 the Lenders party thereto and GKS Funding. On March 31
 2017
 we received a notice of default from GKS Funding stating that
we were in default of the Loan for failure to make a scheduled interest payment on the Loan that was due on March 31
 2017. If
such failure described above was not cured within the 15-day cure period
 which was April 15
 2017
 the Lenders (through GKS Funding
as administrative agent under the Loan Agreement) intended to exercise all rights and remedies available to them under the Loan
Agreement
 related note and applicable law
 which included foreclosing on the collateral under the Loan Agreement.


the outstanding balance of our obligations under the Loan Agreement was approximately $1
011
800
 plus accrued and accruing legal
fees and expenses. Over the past several months
 we have experienced significant operating losses and have been unable to raise
additional capital in order to pay the expenses necessary to continue to operate its business. For the same reason
 we were unable
to pay interest on the Loan on March 31
 2017 (the &ldquo;Existing Default&rdquo;).


 and after
considering all options
 our Board of Directors determined that we would not have sufficient funds to cure the Existing Default
on or before April 15
 2017. In addition
 given our inability to raise additional capital to fund ongoing operations
 we also
determined that we would be unable to continue to operate as a going concern. Thus
 we determined that it was in the best interests
of all constituents that we cooperate with GKS Funding and its exercise of remedies.


    
    



Pursuant
to the Cooperation Agreement
 we and GKS Funding agreed as follows: (i) we waived the 15-day cure period with respect to the Existing
Default immediately upon execution of the Cooperation Letter and GKS Funding has the right to exercise its remedies under the
Loan Agreement and applicable law with respect to such event of default
 including
 without limitation
 by scheduling and conducting
a sale of all of the collateral under the Loan Agreement on or about April 17
 2017 (the &ldquo;UCC Sale&rdquo;); (ii) GKS Funding
agreed to fund loans to us up to the date of the UCC Sale to permit us to pay the Budgeted Expenses (as defined in the Cooperation
Agreement) as and when due with this new loan
 which is (a) secured by a first priority security interest in all of our real and
personal assets
 property
 fixtures
 rights and interests
 (b) shall have priority in payment over the Loan made pursuant to the
Loan Agreement; and (c) shall be repaid
 before any other payments are made by us
 out of the first cash proceeds of the collateral
received by us; and (iii) we consented to fully cooperate with GKS Funding in connection with the UCC Sale
 as well as the exercise
by GKS Funding of any of its other right and remedies in connection therewith.

In
light of the foregoing
 we do not anticipate that we will be able to continue in our current line of business. At this point
the Board is reevaluating its business plan and strategy and has not made any determination as to whether or not it will seek
to engage in a new line of business.


provisions to the conversion price if we issue equity or other derivatives at a price less than the exercise price set forth in
such preferred stock and warrants. These reset provisions result in a derivative liability in our financial statements. Our derivative
liabilities decreased to $131
043 at December 31
 2016 from $742
833 at December 31
 2015 due to a decrease in our stock price.
Fair values for exchange traded securities and derivatives are based on quoted market prices. Where market prices are not readily
available
 fair values are determined using market based pricing models incorporating readily observable market data and requiring
judgment and estimates.


The
following discussion focuses on information in more detail on the main elements of the net decrease in cash during the year ended
December 31
 2016 included in the accompanying Statements of Cash Flow. The table below sets forth a summary of the significant

Net
cash used by operating activities decreased by $613
225 for the year ended December 31
 2016
 primarily due to a decreased net
loss and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by investing activities decreased by $169
463 for the
year ended December 31
 2016
 primarily due to sales of fixed assets in 2015. Net cash used by financing activities decreased
by $14
978 for the year ended December 31
 2016
 primarily due to decreased borrowing.



Outstanding
Notes


 the outstanding
balance of our obligations under the Loan Agreement was approximately $1
011
800
 plus accrued and accruing legal fees and expenses.
The Loan is secured by a lien on all of our assets. As previously stated
 we were unable to pay the interest under the Loan Agreement
and GKS Funding has indicated that it intends to exercise its remedies under the Loan Agreement and applicable law with respect
to such event of default
 including
 without limitation
 by scheduling and conducting a sale of all of the collateral under the
Loan Agreement on or about April 17
 2017.

As
of December 31
 2016
 we had outstanding non-convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1
257
000 due to related
parties that mature within one year.

We
also have non-convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1
850
000 payable to unrelated parties that mature within
one year.

In
addition
 we have outstanding convertible notes payable to related parties in the principal amount of $624
866 at December 31
2016.

The
amount of accrued and unpaid interest was $627
937 on the same date.


    
    



Capital
expenditures.
 2016
 we had no material commitments for capital expenditures. On July 17
 2015
we entered into an equipment purchase agreement (the &ldquo;Purchase Agreement&rdquo;) with Fordham Capital Partners
 LLC (&ldquo;Fordham&rdquo;)
pursuant to which we sold all of our right
 title and interest in production equipment utilized by the Company to Fordham for
a purchase price of $500
000. Concurrently with entering into the Purchase Agreement
 on July 17
 2015
 we entered into an equipment
lease agreement (the &ldquo;Equipment Lease Agreement&rdquo;) with Fordham pursuant to which we leased the production equipment
from Fordham on terms that included the following: a lease term of 24 months
 monthly lease payments by us of $15
800 and the
option (at the election of the Company) to purchase the equipment on or after July 8
 2016 on the following terms: (i) if the
purchase date is between 12- 18 months $425
000; (ii) if the purchase date is between 19- 23 months: $360
000; and (iii) if the
purchase date is during the 24th month (but no later than July 8
 2017): $325
000. On February 1
 2017
 we used a portion of the
proceeds of a loan to exercise our purchase option under the Equipment Lease Agreement. The production equipment has been pledged
to GKS Funding as collateral and we anticipate it will be sold when GKS Funding exercises its remedies under the Loan Agreement.

Lease
commitments.
 Illinois.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
lease is on a month to month basis. Monthly rental payments are $17
972
 inclusive of property taxes.

.&nbsp;&nbsp;In
July 2007
 we were sued in the 20th Judicial Circuit Court
 St. Clair County
 Illinois by Joseph Sanfilippo and James Cluck for
violation of the Consumer Fraud Act and is seeking damages in excess of $200
000.&nbsp;&nbsp;The trial court has issued a default
order against us
 and has denied our motion to reconsider.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management believes that the trial court&rsquo;s rulings
were erroneous and that it has grounds for appeal
 and that the underlying allegations are frivolous and wholly without merit
and we will vigorously defend the claim. The outcome of this matter is unknown as of the report date.&nbsp;&nbsp;However
 we have
conservatively allocated a reserve of $102
000 to satisfy any liability it may incur as a result of this proceeding.

Although
there can be no assurances
 based on the information currently available
 management believes that it is probable that our ultimate
outcome of this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements of.&nbsp;&nbsp;However
an adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial results of in the period in which it is recorded.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

As
of December 31
 2016 and December 31
 2015
 we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Critical
Accounting Policies

The
Financial Statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to management&rsquo;s discussion and analysis. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
 the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. These estimates are generally based on historical experience
 current conditions and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources
 as well as identifying
and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures


    
    




 with the
participation of the Company&rsquo;s interim Chief Executive Officer
 who also serves as the Company&rsquo;s interim Chief Financial
Officer
 evaluated the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;)) as of the end
of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation
 the Company&rsquo;s interim Chief Executive Officer who is also
the interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that
 as of December 31
 2016
 the Company&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective (1) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the SEC&rsquo;s rules and forms and
(2) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to us
 including our Chief Executive Officer and interim Chief Financial Officer
 as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. This conclusion is based primarily on the material weaknesses in internal
control over financial reporting that were identified and disclosed previously
 where management identified material weaknesses
consisting of ineffective controls over (i) the control environment
 (ii) financial statement disclosure; and (iii) financial
reporting
 and our failure to complete the process of remediating these weaknesses by the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report.


Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting


Officer resigned at the end of his contract and was replaced by our former Chief Executive Officer. The Company also did not renew
the contract of a temporary employee who served as staff accountant whose duties were assumed by another existing full-time employee.
Despite the changes during the year ended December 31
 2016
 the changes did not materially affect
 nor are they reasonably likely
to materially affect
 the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. The Company continues to develop internal
processes and segregations to mitigate the internal control deficiencies but that is still a work in process.


Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls

Our
Principal Executive Officer who is also our Principal Financial Officer does not expect that our disclosure controls or internal
controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Although our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable
assurance of achieving their objectives
 a control system
 no matter how well conceived and operated
 can provide only reasonable
not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further
 the design of a control system must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints
 and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud
 if any
 within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
can be faulty
 and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally
 controls can be circumvented
if there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions.

Furthermore
smaller reporting companies face additional limitations. Smaller reporting companies employ fewer individuals and find it difficult
to properly segregate duties. Often
 one or two individuals control every aspect of the Company&rsquo;s operation and are in a
position to override any system of internal control. Additionally
 smaller reporting companies tend to utilize general accounting
software packages that lack a rigorous set of software controls.

detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and any disposition of our assets;




    
    
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that
our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and




    
    
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.



    
    



A
material weakness is a deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company&rsquo;s annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31
 2016. In making this assessment
 our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on this assessment
management has identified the following three material weaknesses that have caused management to conclude that
 as of December
31
 2016
 our disclosure controls and procedures
 and our internal control over financial reporting
 were not effective at the
reasonable assurance level:



    
As
    of December 31
 2016
 we did not maintain effective controls over the control environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically we have
    not developed and effectively communicated to our employees our accounting policies and procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;This has resulted
    in inconsistent practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since these entity level programs have a pervasive effect across the organization
    management has determined that these circumstances constitute a material weakness.




    
As
    of December 31
 2016
 we did not maintain effective controls over financial statement disclosure. Specifically
 controls were
    not designed and in place to ensure that all disclosures required were addressed in our financial statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly
    management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness.




    
As
    of December 31
 2016
 we did not maintain effective controls over financial reporting. Specifically controls were not designed
    and in place to ensure that the financial impact of certain complex equity and derivative liability transactions were appropriately
    and correctly reported. The transactions were identified by the auditors and calculated and reported correctly as of December
    31
 2016.


Remediation
of Material Weaknesses


 as of December 31
2016
 we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting primarily due to us not having developed
accounting policies and procedures and effectively communicating the same to our employees. Management plans to address these
weaknesses based on future business plans if it is able to generate revenue to retain additional employees.


If
the remedial measures described above are insufficient to address any of the identified material weaknesses or are not implemented
effectively
 or if additional deficiencies arise in the future
 material misstatements in our interim or annual financial statements
may occur in the future. Among other things
 any unremediated material weaknesses could result in material post-closing adjustments
in future financial statements.

 2015 and resigned on May 17

 both of which are important to the
Board&rsquo;s strategic planning and risk management responsibilities.

Act and the rules promulgated there under
 officers and directors of the company and persons who beneficially own more than 10%
of our common shares are required to file with the SEC and furnish to our reports of ownership and change in ownership with respect
to all equity securities of the company.&nbsp;&nbsp;Based solely on our review of the copies of such reports received by us during
or with respect to the fiscal year ended December 31
 2016 and all prior years
 and written representations from such reporting
persons
 we believe that those persons who were our officers
 directors and 10% shareholders during any portion of the fiscal year
ended December 31
 2016
 complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to such individuals other than a failure
by our former Chief Executive Officer Mr. Kahn and our former Chairman Mr. Garfinkle to file one Form 4 with respect to one transaction.

directors recognize and deal with ethical issues
 provide mechanisms to report unethical conduct
 and foster a culture of honesty
and accountability. The Code covers all areas of professional conduct relating to service on the Agritech Board
 including conflicts
of interest
 unfair or unethical use of corporate opportunities

established a Nominating Committee in 2008; however we currently do not have anyone serving on the Nominating Committee. The related
provisions set forth in the Bylaws serve as the charter for the Nominating Committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board Nominating Committee
which is to be composed of two directors of our Company
 identifies candidates for director nominees through recommendations solicited
from other directors
 our executive officers
 search firms or other advisors
 shareholders pursuant to the procedures set forth
below
 and through such other methods as the independent directors deem to be helpful.&nbsp;&nbsp;Based upon an evaluation of
the candidates by the Board Nominating Committee
 it recommends to the full Board candidates it has determined to be qualified
for serving on the Board.&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective in 2015
 Dan Jeffery was appointed a member of the Nominating Committee
 with Morris
Garfinkle serving as chairman.&nbsp;Mr. Jeffrey and Mr. Garfinkle no longer serve as directors and we currently do not have an
active Nominating Committee.&nbsp;The Nominating Committee did not meet during 2016.

Our
Bylaws provide that shareholders
 in submitting recommendations to the Nominating Committee for director candidates
 shall follow
the following procedures:



    
    
for
    nomination must be received by a date not later than the close of business on the 120th calendar day prior to the calendar
    date our proxy statement was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the previous year&rsquo;s
    annual meeting of shareholders or special meeting in lieu of annual meeting of shareholders.



    
    





    
    
Such recommendation for nomination shall be made in
writing and shall include the following information: (A) name of the shareholder making the recommendation; (B) a written statement
disclosing such shareholder&rsquo;s beneficial ownership of our securities; (C) name of the individual recommended for consideration
as a director nominee; (D) a written statement as to why such recommended candidate would be able to fulfill the duties of a director;
(E) a written statement describing how the recommended candidate meets the independence requirements established by the NYSE Amex
(now known as NYSE MKT) or any other requirements adopted by us; (F) a written statement disclosing the recommended candidate&rsquo;s
beneficial ownership of our securities; (G) a written statement disclosing relationships between the recommended candidate and
us which may constitute a conflict of interest; and (H) a written statement by the recommended candidate that the candidate is
willing and able to serve on the Board of Directors.


Our
Bylaws provide that the composition of the Board of Directors must meet the independence requirements promulgated by the NYSE
Amex (now known as NYSE MKT) or such other requirements as may be adopted by us.

The
Company requires its directors to possess certain minimum qualifications
 including the following:



    
    
. Nominees should have demonstrated
business acumen
 experience and ability to exercise sound judgments in matters that relate to the current and long-term objectives
of the corporation and should be willing and able to contribute positively to the decision-making process of the corporation.




    
    
. Nominees must be free
from any relationship that
 in the opinion of the Board
 would interfere with
 or have the appearance of interfering with
 the
exercise of his or her independent judgment as a member of the Board
 including any conflicts of interest stemming from his or
her institutional or other affiliations
 and candidates should be able to act in the interests of all shareholders.




    
    
. Nominees shall not have been
convicted of any criminal offense or been subject to any adverse civil judgment in any jurisdiction involving financial crimes
acts involving monies or breach of trust
 moral turpitude
 misfeasance or malfeasance
 or been convicted in any jurisdiction of
a crime that is a felony
 or been deemed by the Board to have violated company policy


The
Company also considers the following qualities and skills in selecting its directors:



    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
reputation for integrity and high moral and ethical
character;

    
    
    

    
    
 the diversity
of viewpoints
 backgrounds
 or experiences of the Board as a whole; and

    
    
    

    
    
    


A
director candidate recommended by our stockholders will be considered in the same manner as a nominee recommended by a Board member
management or other sources.

While
the Board does not have a separate formal diversity policy
 it is our and the Board&rsquo;s policy to identify qualified potential
candidates without regard to any candidate&rsquo;s race
 color
 disability
 gender
 national origin
 religion or creed
 and we
seek to ensure the fair representation of shareholder interests on the Board of Directors through the criteria set forth above.
In selecting our directors
 we consider the potential to contribute to the diversity of viewpoints
 backgrounds
 or experiences
of the Board of Directors as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors believes that the use of the Nominating Committee&rsquo;s
general criteria
 along with non-discriminatory policies
 will best result in a Board of Directors that shows diversity in many
respects. The Board of Directors believes that it currently maintains that diversity.

Audit

Until
April 2017
 the Company had a separate Audit Committee. The Company no longer has a separate Audit Committee.

ITEM
Executive
                                         Compensation.

Our
compensation philosophy has been
 and continues to be
 that compensation should drive long-term value creation for our stockholders.
Total compensation for each employee should be based on individual our performance
 market practice
 and the value of our employee&rsquo;s
position. Our compensation programs should not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk taking.

Compensation
consists solely of cash compensation and the issuance of stock options pursuant to our Incentive Compensation Plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;We
pay base salary in order to provide a predictable level of compensation that is competitive in the marketplace for the position
responsibilities and individual skills
 knowledge
 and experience of each executive.&nbsp;&nbsp;We provide stock options that
are generally available to all of our employees in order to further our goal of attracting and retaining senior executives of
outstanding ability.&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not believe that our employee compensation policies are reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on our company.

Employment Agreement
 Mr. Kahn was granted 6
067
931 fully-vested shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock
 par value $0.00005
per share (the &ldquo;Common Stock&rdquo;)

 2015
 Mr. Smith was issued warrants exercisable for 31
000
000 shares of common stock
 in
consideration of the services to be provided to the Company as Chief Executive Officer. The exercise price of these warrants is
$0.45 per share. The fair value of the warrants issued is estimated on the date of grant using the Black- Scholes valuation model.
The assumptions used in the model included the historical volatility of the Company&rsquo;s stock of 81.99%
 and the risk- free
rate for periods within the expected life of the warrant based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect of 0.85%.

Employee
directors do not receive any separate compensation for their activities on the board of directors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-employee directors
received 1
006
711 options with a strike price of $0.0298 as an annual retainer.

Non-employee
directors are reimbursed for travel expenses incurred in conjunction with their duties as directors. Furthermore
 we will provide
the broadest form of indemnification under Nevada law under which liabilities may arise as a result of their role on the board
of directors and payments for reimbursements for expenses incurred by a director in defending against claims in connection with
their role
 and the director satisfies the statutory standard of care.

 each non-executive member of the Board (Morris Garfinkle
 Dan Jeffery and Edward B. Smith III) was granted
pursuant to the Plan an option to purchase an aggregate 1
006
711 shares of common stock (the equivalent of $30

 2016
 the unrecognized
compensation cost related to all non- vested share- based compensation arrangements granted under the Plan was
$40

 with a target
annual bonus equal to 100% of his annual base salary and a maximum annual bonus each year equal to 200% of his base salary. Mr.
Kahn&rsquo;s annual bonus for the 2016 calendar year was prorated based on the number of days served during 2016. The actual amount
of the annual bonus earned by and payable to Mr. Kahn in any year will be determined upon the satisfaction of goals and objectives
established by the Compensation Committee (the &ldquo;Compensation Committee&rdquo;) of the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors
(the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;) and will be subject to such other terms and conditions of the Company&rsquo;s Annual Incentive Program
as in effect from time to time.

Pursuant
to the Kahn Employment Agreement
 Mr. Kahn was granted 6
067
931 fully-vested shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock

 respectively (together
with the 6
067
931 shares granted on the Effective Date

The
Kahn Employment Agreement provided that commencing in calendar year 2017
 and each year thereafter
 Mr. Kahn will be eligible
to participate in the Company&rsquo;s annual equity incentive compensation program
 with an annual target equity grant for each
year in which Mr. Kahn participates in the equity incentive compensation program having a grant date fair value equal to 100%
of Mr. Kahn&rsquo;s base salary and a maximum annual equity award for each year in which Mr. Kahn participates in the equity incentive
compensation program equal to 250% of Mr. Kahn&rsquo;s base salary. In determining the amount of Mr. Kahn&rsquo;s equity grant
for any year
 the Compensation Committee will consider the Company&rsquo;s performance over the immediately preceding fiscal year.


of the Effective Date and each Equity Issuance Date (as defined below)
 until such time as Mr. Kahn terminates employment with
the Company
 the Kahn Employment Agreement provided that Mr. Kahn will receive an additional grant of unrestricted Common Stock
(which additional grant will be deemed to be a part of the initial Equity Award)
 if necessary
 so that on each such anniversary
and each such Equity Issuance Date
 the total number of shares received by Mr. Kahn pursuant to the Equity Award will equal at
least 3.5% of the Company&rsquo;s shares of Common Stock on a fully diluted basis until April 30
 2016
 4.25% until April 30
2018
 and 5.0% thereafter. Under this provision
 Mr. Kahn is owed 416
695 shares at December 31
 2016. For purposes of the Kahn
Employment Agreement
 an &ldquo;Equity Issuance Date&rdquo; is any date on which the Company consummates the sale of or issuance
of (i) more than 1% of the Company&rsquo;s shares of Common Stock on a fully diluted basis; or (ii) any instrument that is convertible
into more than 1% of the Company&rsquo;s shares of Common Stock on a fully diluted basis. For the sake of clarity
 in calculating
the total number of shares held by Mr. Kahn pursuant to the Equity Award
 only the initial shares granted and any additional shares
granted in accordance with this paragraph will be considered and any shares (A) held by Mr. Kahn on or prior to the Effective
Date or (B) granted to or acquired by Mr. Kahn in any other manner following the grant to Mr. Kahn of the Equity Award (including
any annual equity award grant or otherwise) will be disregarded.


Agreement provided that for certain specified payments in the event that Mr. Kahn&rsquo;s employment contract is terminated for
death or Cause (as such terms are defined in the Kahn Employment Agreement)
 by the Company without Cause or terminated by him
for Good Reason
 upon a Change of Control (as defined in the Kahn Employment Agreement)
 and due to Disability (as defined in
the Kahn Employment Agreement).

Agreement.

On
April&nbsp;5
 2017
 the Company and GKS Funding entered into a letter agreement
 a copy of which is attached to a Schedule 13D
and is incorporated by reference herein&nbsp;(the &ldquo;Letter Agreement&rdquo;)
 pursuant to which (i)&nbsp;the Company informed
GKS Funding that the Company has determined (1)&nbsp;it will not have sufficient funds to cure the interest payment default that
occurred on March&nbsp;31
 2017
 under the Loan Agreement and the Note as previously described in Amendment No.&nbsp;2 and (2)&nbsp;it
cannot continue to operate as a going concern and (ii)&nbsp;the Company and GKS Funding agreed as follows:

(1)
The Company waived the cure period with respect to the Existing Default (as defined in the Letter Agreement). As a result
 the
Company agreed
 immediately upon execution of the Letter Agreement
 the Existing Default became an Event of Default (as defined
in the Loan Agreement) (with
 for avoidance of doubt
 no further right to cure or grace period)
 and GKS Funding shall have the
right to exercise its remedies under the Loan Agreement and applicable law with respect to such Event of Default
 including
 without
limitation
 by scheduling and conducting a UCC sale of all of the Collateral (as defined in the Loan Agreement) on or about April&nbsp;17
2017 (the &ldquo;UCC Sale&rdquo;).

(2)
GKS Funding agreed to fund loans to the Company up to the date of the UCC Sale to permit the Company to pay the Budgeted Expenses
(as defined in the Letter Agreement) as and when due and payable in accordance with&nbsp;Exhibit A&nbsp;to the Letter Agreement
pursuant to documentation in form and substance acceptable to GKS Funding and Company (the &ldquo;New Loans&rdquo;). The New Loans:
(a)&nbsp;shall be secured by a first priority security interest in all of the real and personal assets
 property
 fixtures
 rights
and interests of the Company
 whether now existing or owned and hereafter arising or acquired and wherever located; (b)&nbsp;shall
have priority in payment over the Loans (as defined in the Loan Agreement) made by GKS Funding pursuant to the Loan Agreement;
and (c)&nbsp;shall be repaid
 before any other payments are made by the Company
 out of the first cash proceeds of the Collateral
received by the Company.

(3)
The Company consents to
 and shall fully cooperate with GKS Funding in connection with
 the UCC Sale and the disposition of the
Collateral in connection therewith
 as well as the exercise by GKS Funding of any of its other right and remedies in connection
therewith.

GKS
Funding intends to try to acquire all of the Collateral at the UCC Sale. GKS Funding also intends to credit bid the amounts due
under the Loan Agreement and the Note at the UCC Sale.



are evidenced by a promissory note&nbsp;(the &ldquo;New Note&rdquo;). The New Notes accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to
5%. Accrued and unpaid interest on the outstanding principal is payable monthly in arrears on the last business day of each month
in which any amount remains outstanding under the New Note. The principal amount
 together with all accrued and unpaid interest
thereon
 is required to be repaid to GKS Funding out of the proceeds received from the accounts receivable of the Company collected
after April&nbsp;7
 2017
 immediately upon such receipt.


of the $60
000 New Loans that were made on April&nbsp;7
 2017
 have been used by the Company to pay critical vendors of the Company
and for the Company to fund payroll.


to the making of the loan under the New Note
 GKS Funding required the lenders under the Loan Agreement (which include GKS Funding)
to enter into a subordination agreement with the Company and GKS Funding (the &ldquo;New Subordination Agreement&rdquo;). The
New Subordination Agreement will make the New Note the senior secured debt of the Company
 provided that the balance of the Second
Promissory Note
 which is less than $300
 will be senior to the New Note until paid in full.


    
    


All
additional New Loans made to the Company by GKS Funding after April&nbsp;7
 2017
 pursuant to the Letter Agreement will be made
on the same terms and conditions as set forth in the New Note
 the Security Agreement
 the Patent Security Agreement and the New
Subordination Agreement.

The
proceeds of the $60
000 New Loans made on April&nbsp;7
 2017
 was used by the Company to pay critical vendors of the Company and

000 was contributed by Mr.&nbsp;Kahn from his personal funds to GKS Funding on April&nbsp;7
2017
 and was used by GKS Funding to fund $60
000 of New Loans on April&nbsp;7
 2017. Mr.&nbsp;Kahn intends to use personal funds
for additional contributions to GKS Funding in the event GKS Funding funds additional New Loans pursuant to the Letter Agreement.
$30
000 was contributed by Mr.&nbsp;Garfinkle from his personal funds to GKS Funding on April&nbsp;7
 2017
 and was used by GKS
Funding to fund $60
000 of New Loans on April&nbsp;7
 2017. Mr.&nbsp;Garfinkle intends to use personal funds for additional contributions
to GKS Funding in the event GKS Funding funds additional New Loans pursuant to the Letter Agreement.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and
Stockholders
of Agritech Worldwide
 Inc. (Formerly Z Trim Holdings Inc.)

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Agritech Worldwide
 Inc. (Formerly Z Trim Holdings Inc.) as of December 31
 2016
and the related statements of operations
 changes in stockholders&rsquo; equity (deficit) and cash flows for the year then ended.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. The company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company&rsquo;s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining
 on a test
basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
 assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion
 the financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of Agritech
Worldwide
 Inc. as of December 31
 2016
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America.

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the financial statements
 the Company does not have enough cash on hand to meet its current liabilities and has had
reoccurring losses as of December 31
 2016. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern. Management&rsquo;s plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

AGRITECH
WORLDWIDE
 INC. (FORMERLY Z TRIM HOLDINGS
 INC.)


NOTE
1 &ndash; NATURE OF BUSINESS

Agritech
Worldwide
 Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) is an agritech company that owns existing
 and has developed new products and processes
to make use of biomass for uses in the food and industrial markets. The Company&rsquo;s food division currently sells a line of
products to the food industry that can help food manufacturers reduce their costs and help them solve many production problems.
The Company&rsquo;s technology provides value-added ingredients across virtually all food industry categories. The Company&rsquo;s
all-natural products
 among other things
 help to reduce fat and calories
 add fiber
 provide shelf-stability
 prevent oil migration
and add binding capacity &ndash; all without degrading the taste and texture of the final food products. Perhaps most significantly
Z Trim&rsquo;s products can help extend finished products
 and thereby increase its customers&rsquo; gross margins. The Company&rsquo;s
industrial division
 opened in 2012
 plans to sell eco-friendly ingredients to oil drilling
 hydraulic fracturing
 petroleum coke
steel/aluminum
 paper and other industries. The Company&rsquo;s industrial ingredients are highly functional in applications for
adhesives
 binders
 viscofiers and emulsifiers.

NOTE
2 &ndash;GOING CONCERN


assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As of April 14
 2017
 the date that the independent registered public
accountant issued its report on the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31
 2016
 the Company did
not have enough cash on hand to meet its current liabilities. In addition
 based on the proposed UCC sale of its assets
 the Company
will no longer have operations and may be seeking other opportunities. The Company had recurring losses as of December 31
 2016.
As a result
 the independent registered public accountant&rsquo;s audit report included an explanatory paragraph in respect to
our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company may attempt to secure additional funding through debt or equity financing
arrangements and may seek other business opportunities.

NOTE
3 &ndash; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of the accompanying financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company generally recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 delivery has occurred
 the fee
is fixed or determinable
 and collectability is probable. In instances where the final acceptance of the product is specified
by the customer
 revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. No provisions were established for estimated
product returns and allowances based on the Company&rsquo;s historical experience.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts 

Management
of the Company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of
receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding
invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed
 provisions are provided at differing rates
 based upon the age of the
receivable. In determining these percentages
 management analyzes its historical collection experience and current economic trends.
If the historical data the Company uses to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to
collect outstanding receivables
 additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations
could be materially affected. As of December 31
 2016 and 2015
 management concluded that no reserve was necessary.



    
    


Cash
and cash equivalents 

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows
 the Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
less to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents as of December 31
 2016 and 2015.

Inventory


Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost or market
 using the first-in
 first-out method. The Company follows standard costing methods for
manufactured products.

Property
and Equipment 

Property
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as
incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful
lives of five to ten years are used for machinery and equipment
 office equipment and furniture
 and automobile. Estimated useful
lives of up to five years are used for computer equipment and related software. Depreciation and amortization of leasehold improvements
are computed using the term of the lease.

Income
Taxes 

The
amount of current and deferred taxes payable or refundable is recognized as of the date of the financial statements
 utilizing
currently enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred tax expenses or benefits are recognized in the financial statements for the changes
in deferred tax liabilities or assets between years.

Accounting
for Derivative Instruments

All
derivatives have been recorded on the balance sheet at fair value based on the lattice model calculation. These derivatives
 including
embedded derivatives in the Company&rsquo;s warrants which have reset provisions to the exercise price and conversion price if
the Company issues equity or other derivatives at a price less than the exercise price set forth in such warrants
 are separately
valued and accounted for on the Company&rsquo;s balance sheet. Fair values for exchange traded securities and derivatives are
based on quoted market prices. Where market prices are not readily available
 fair values are determined using market based pricing
models incorporating readily observable market data and requiring judgment and estimates.

Lattice
Valuation Model

The
Company valued the warrants and the conversion features in its outstanding convertible notes and preferred stock using a lattice
valuation model
 with the assistance of a valuation consultant. The lattice model values these instruments based on a probability
weighted discounted cash flow model. The Company uses the model to develop a set of potential scenarios. Probabilities of each
scenario occurring during the remaining term of the instruments are determined based on management&rsquo;s projections and the
expert&rsquo;s calculations. These probabilities are used to create a cash flow projection over the term of the instruments and
determine the probability that the projected cash flow will be achieved. A discounted weighted average cash flow for each scenario
is then calculated and compared to the discounted cash flow of the instruments without the compound embedded derivative in order
to determine a value for the compound embedded derivative.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

The
Company&rsquo;s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 inventory
 accounts payable and
accrued liabilities. The estimated fair value of cash
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate
their carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of these instruments. None of these instruments are held for trading purposes.

The
Company utilizes various types of financing to fund its business needs
 including convertible debt with warrants attached. The
Company reviews its warrants and conversion features of securities issued as to whether they are freestanding or contain an embedded
derivative and
 if so
 whether they are classified as a liability at each reporting period until the amount is settled and reclassified
into equity with changes in fair value recognized in current earnings. At December 31
 2015
 the Company had warrants to purchase
common stock
 the fair values of which are classified as a liability.



    
    


Inputs
used in the valuation to derive fair value are classified based on a fair value hierarchy which distinguishes between assumptions
based on market data (observable inputs) and an entity&rsquo;s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of
three levels:

Level
one &mdash; Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

Level
two &mdash; Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and

Level
three &mdash; Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions
 which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect
those assumptions that a market participant would use.

Determining
which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company evaluates its hierarchy
disclosures each quarter. The Company&rsquo;s only asset or liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis is its derivative
liability associated with warrants to purchase common stock and preferred stock. The fair value of the derivative liabilities
at December 31
 2016 and 2015 was $131
042 and $742
833
 respectively. The decrease in the derivative liability for the twelve
months ended December 31
 2015 was $611
790.

Income
(Loss) Per Common Share

Basic
net income (loss) per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders
by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing
net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding and
 when diluted
 potential shares from options and warrants
to purchase common stock using the treasury stock method. Diluted net loss per common share does not differ from basic net loss
per common share since potential shares of common stock are anti-dilutive for all periods presented.

Cashless
Exercise of Warrants/Options

The
Company has issued warrants and options to purchase common stock where the holder is entitled to exercise via a cashless exercise.
The Company accounts for the issuance of common stock on the cashless exercise of warrants and options on a net basis.

Stock-Based
Compensation


payment awards made to employees and directors
 including stock options
 restricted stock and employee stock purchases related
to employee stock purchase plans
 on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that
is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite service periods. We estimate the fair value
of each share-based award using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes model is highly complex and dependent
on key estimates by management. The estimates with the greatest degree of subjective judgment are the estimated lives of the stock-based
awards and the estimated volatility of our stock price.



    
    


Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In
April 2015
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&ldquo;ASU&rdquo;)
No. 2015-03
(&ldquo;ASU 2015-03&rdquo;)
 which changes the presentation
of debt issuance costs in financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a
direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported
as interest expense. It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016. Early adoption is permitted.
The new guidance will be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating
the impact of adoption of ASU 2015-03 on its balance sheets.

In
August
 2015
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date
(&ldquo;ASU 2015-14&rdquo;). The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year.
Public business entities
 certain not-for-profit entities
 and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU
2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 including interim reporting periods within that reporting
period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31
 2016
 including interim
reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard.

On
February 25
 2016
 the FASB issued Topic 842
 its highly-anticipated leasing standard for both lessees and lessors. Under its
core principle
 a lessee will recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all arrangements with terms longer
than 12 months. Lessor accounting remains largely consistent with existing U.S. GAAP. The amendments are effective for public
companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years. At inception
a lessee must classify all leases as either finance or operating. The Company intends to adopt Topic 842 upon extension of the
current lease or upon entering into a new lease agreement for alternative facilities. The Company is investigating the effect
of adoption of Topic 842 on its results of operations and financial condition. However
 it is not anticipated that adoption of
Topic 842 will have a material impact on the results of operations or financial condition of the Company.

000; (ii) if the purchase date is between 19- 23 months: $360
000; and (iii)
if the purchase date is during the 24th month (but no later than July 8
 2017): $325
000. The Equipment Lease Agreement includes
customary events of default
 including non- payment by the Company of the monthly lease payments and the payment of penalties
upon such late payments. The Company received cash proceeds of $172
911 from the Purchase Agreement after paying off the obligations
described above. These proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.



    
    


On
February 1
 2017

 which
the Company did not meet. Under the terms of the RRA
 as partial compensation
 the Company was required to make pro rata payments
to each Investor in an amount equal to 1.5% of the aggregate amount invested by such Investor for each 30-day period or pro rata
for any portion thereof following the Filing Deadline for which no registration statement was filed. We obtained a release and
waiver of the amounts due from almost all of the 2008 investors. Under the terms of the RRA
 we potentially owe

NOTE
12 &ndash; DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES

Certain
of the Company&rsquo;s convertible preferred stock and warrants have reset provisions to the exercise price if the Company issues
equity or other derivatives at a price less than the exercise price set forth in such warrants. This ratchet provision results
in a derivative liability in our financial statements.

Our
derivative liabilities decreased to $131
043 at December 31
 2016 from $742
833 at December 31
 2015. The gain recognized during
the twelve months ended December 31
 2016 was $567
139 as compared to a loss of $1
265
611 for the twelve months ended December
31
 2015. During the year ended December 31
 2016
 a portion of the derivative liability was written off to additional paid in
capital due to the purchase of the warrants utilizing common stock.

The
assumptions used to value the derivative liabilities in the lattice model for the year ended December 31
 2016 included the closing
stock price of $.0101 per share
 and the projected volatility based on a historical value used of 275% and assuming the probability
for an event of default occurring 0% of the time and increasing by 0.0% per month. The assumptions used to value the derivative
liabilities in the lattice model for the year ended December 31
 2015 included the closing stock price of $0.42 per share
 and
the projected volatility based on a historical value used of 165% and assuming the probability for an event of default occurring
5% of the time and increasing by 0.10% per month.

Due
to the anti- dilution provisions of some of the warrants outstanding before the January 8
 2015 transaction
 the exercise price
on 15
512
057 warrants was reduced to $0.35 and the number of shares of common stock into which the warrants became exercisable
was adjusted such that the warrants were then exercisable into 54
400
204 shares of common stock.

The
fair values for the Company&rsquo;s derivative liabilities related to the Warrants (5 year warrants at $0.35
 $0.45
 and $0.64
with a full reset feature) issued is $130
028. The derivative instruments were valued as of December 31
 2015 with the following
assumptions:



    
    
The Holder would automatically exercise the warrants
at a stock price above the exercise price with the target exercise price dropping as expiration approaches





    
    
The projected annual volatility was based on the Company&rsquo;s
historical volatility between 148% and 193%





    
    
An event of default would occurred 5% of the time
 increasing
to 0.10% per month





    
    
Dilutive/Full Reset events projected to occur based
on future projected capital needs (future financings are projected going forward as of December 2015) resulting in the weighted
conversion price dropping from the initial conversion price (no reset events have occurred).


Effective
January 1
 2015 the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Jeffery Consulting Group

 and 250
000 shares each
at the three month
 six month
 and nine month anniversaries of this agreement. The fair value of the warrants issued is estimated
on the date of grant using the Black- Scholes valuation model. The assumptions used in the model included the historical volatility
of the Company&rsquo;s stock of 84.52%
 and the risk- free rate for periods within the expected life of the warrant based on the
U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect of 1.07%. In 2015 the Company recognized compensation expense of $249
635. The Company also
agreed to accrue $5
000 per month which becomes payable to Jeffery Consulting once the Company has raised $3 million in additional
capital.

included the historical volatility of the Company&rsquo;s stock of 81.99%
 and the risk- free rate for periods within the expected
life of the warrant based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect of 0.85%. In 2015 the Company recognized compensation expense

NOTE
15 &ndash; INCOME TAXES

The
Company has incurred losses since its inception and
 therefore
 has not been subject to federal income taxes. As of December 31
2016
 the Company has net operating loss (&ldquo;NOL&rdquo;) carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately $64
700
000
which expire in 2029 through 2036. Losses prior to 2009 have been lost due to mergers
 dissolution of entities
 etc. Under the
provisions of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code greater than 50% ownership changes that occurred in the Company may significantly
limit the Company&rsquo;s ability to utilize its NOL carry forwards to reduce future taxable income and related tax liabilities.

Section
382 considers an owner shift any time there is a transfer of stock by a person who directly
 or indirectly
 owns more than 5%
of the corporation and the percentage of stock of the corporation owned by one or more five percent shareholders has increased
in the aggregate
 by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of stock owned by such shareholders at any time
during the &ldquo;testing period.&rdquo; The &ldquo;testing period&rdquo; is generally a three-year period ending on the date
of any owner or equity structure shift.

The
amount of post-change income that may be offset by pre-change losses is limited each year by the &ldquo;Section 382 Limitation.&rdquo;
Generally
 the Section 382 Limitation is an amount equal to the market capitalization of the old loss corporation multiplied by
a long-term interest rate established monthly by the Internal Revenue Service
 which could significantly reduce or limit the annual
amount of NOL utilization. The Company has not yet determined the qualifying events and resulting limitation that may impact utilization
of net operating losses against future periods.



    
    


At
December 31
 2016 and 2015
 the net deferred tax asset based on a 34% tax rate consisted of the following:

NOTE
18 &ndash; PENDING LITIGATION/CONTINGENT LIABILITY

On
July 7
 2007
 the Company and Greg Halpern
 its former Chief Executive Officer in his individual capacity
 were served with a
complaint by Joseph Sanfilippo and James Cluck for violation of the Consumer Fraud Act and the plaintiffs are seeking damages
in excess of $200
000. The trial court has issued a default order against the Company
 and has denied the Company&rsquo;s Motion
to reconsider. Management believes that the trial court&rsquo;s rulings were erroneous and that it has grounds for appeal

that the underlying allegations are frivolous and wholly without merit and will vigorously defends the claim. The outcome of this
matter is unknown as of the report date. However
 the Company has accrued a liability in the amount of $102
000 in respect to
this litigation.

Average Price&rdquo;) is below $2.25
 the Conversion Price on the maturity date will be reduced to the Trailing Average Price

beneficial conversion feature was recorded on this note.

NOTE
20 &ndash; GUARANTEES

The
Company from time to time enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require the Company to indemnify parties against
third party claims. These contracts primarily relate to: (i) divestiture agreements
 under which the Company may provide customary
indemnifications to purchasers of the Company&rsquo;s businesses or assets; (ii) certain real estate leases
 under which the Company
may be required to indemnify property owners for environmental and other liabilities
 and other claims arising from the Company&rsquo;s
use of the applicable premises; and (iii) certain agreements with the Company&rsquo;s officers
 directors and employees
 under
which the Company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their employment relationship. The
terms of such obligations vary. Generally
 a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated. Because the obligated amounts of these
types of agreements often are not explicitly stated
 the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated.
Historically
 the Company has not been obligated to make significant payments for these obligations
 and no liabilities have been
recorded for these obligations on its balance sheet as of December 31
 2016.



    
    


In
general
 the Company offers a one-year warranty for most of the products it sells. To date
 the Company has not incurred any material
costs associated with these warranties.

NOTE
21 &ndash; SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On
February 1
 2017
 the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the &ldquo;Loan Agreement&rdquo;) with various lenders
including an entity controlled by its chief executive officer
 Jonathan Kahn
 and a director
 Morris Garfinkle
 and issued a note
in connection therewith (the &ldquo;Note&rdquo;). The principal amount of the loan is $996
000. The Loan accrues interest at a
rate per annum equal to the prime rate plus 18.9%. Interest is payable monthly and the principal is payable on the maturity date
of the loan
 which is 2.5 years from the issuance date. The loan is secured by all of the assets of the Company. The Loan Agreement
contains certain covenants regarding financial reporting
 limits on the Company&rsquo;s incurrence of indebtedness
 permitted
investments
 encumbrances
 restricted payments
&nbsp;and mergers and acquisitions.

The
Loan Agreement includes customary events of default
 including non-payment by the Company of the monthly interest payments and
the payment of penalties upon such late payments. The Company used a portion of the proceeds of the loan to exercise its purchase
option under its Equipment Lease Agreement with Fordham Capital Partners
 LLC (&ldquo;Fordham&rdquo;) that it entered into on
July 17
 2015 (the &ldquo;Equipment Lease Agreement&rdquo;). The Company intends to utilize the proceeds from the loan for working
capital purposes.

As
a condition to the Loan Agreement
 two directors of the Company that held senior secured debt of the Company entered into a subordination
agreement with the Company and the administrative agent for the lenders (the &ldquo;Subordination Agreement&rdquo;).

The
foregoing description of the Loan Agreement
 the Note and the Subordination Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified
in their entirety by reference to the full text of&nbsp;such agreements
 which are attached as Exhibits 10.1
 10.2 and 10.1 to
the Form 8-K filed on February 1
 2017and incorporated by reference herein.

On
February 1
 2017
 the Company exercised its option under the Equipment Lease Agreement that it had entered into with Fordham on
July 17
 2015 and paid Fordham $360
000 plus additional expenses for purchase of the Equipment that was subject to the Equipment
Lease Agreement. In connection with the payment
 the Equipment Lease Agreement was terminated
 which was a lease for 24 months
with monthly lease payments of $15
800.

On
February 17
 2017
 Jonathan Kahn
 the Chief Executive Officer of the Company
 and Morris Garfinkle
 the Chairman of the Board
of Directors of the Company (the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;)
 and the Garfinkle Revocable Trust filed a Schedule 13D with the Securities
and Exchange Commission
 which
 among other things
 described a term sheet (the &ldquo;Term Sheet&rdquo;)
 which was annexed to
the Schedule 13D
 that they had presented to the Company&rsquo;s Special Committee of the Board. The Term Sheet is for a proposed
convertible preferred stock financing relating to the potential issuance by the Company of shares of up to $6
000
000 but not
less than $4
000
000 of a newly-created series of preferred stock of the Company. As proposed
 such newly-created preferred stock
would be convertible into up to a maximum of 75% of the Company&rsquo;s equity (on a fully-diluted basis) and would be entitled
as a class
 to designate three of the five directors of the Company.&nbsp;

On
March 14
 2017
 Messrs. Kahn and Garfinkle and the Garfinkle Revocable Trust determined to terminate discussions with the Company
with respect to the Term Sheet and the potential investment contemplated thereby
 and the Company was notified of such determination.

Due
to the Company&rsquo;s ongoing liquidity needs
 on March 15
 2017
 the Company entered into a promissory note with Mr. Kahn and
Mr. Garfinkle as the lenders in the original principal amount of $56
000 (the &ldquo;Promissory Note&rdquo;). The Promissory Note
accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to 5%. Accrued and unpaid interest on the outstanding principal is payable monthly
in arrears on the last business day of each month in which any amount remains outstanding under the Promissory Note. The principal
amount
 together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon
 is required to be repaid to the lenders out of the proceeds received
from the accounts receivable of the Company collected after March 15
 2017
 immediately upon such receipt. The loan under the
Promissory Note is secured by all of the assets of the Company pursuant to a Security Agreement and a Patent Security Agreement.

The
proceeds of the Promissory Note were used by the Company to primarily fund payroll and to pay employee health insurance premiums
and a critical vendor of the Company.



    
    


As
a condition to the making of the loan under the Promissory Note
 the lenders under a loan agreement entered into by the Company
on February 1
 2017 (which lenders included Mr. Kahn and Mr. Garfinkle through GKS Funding)
 which is the senior secured debt
of the Company
 were required to enter into a subordination agreement with the Company and Mr. Kahn and Mr. Garfinkle (the &ldquo;Subordination
Agreement&rdquo;). The Subordination Agreement made the Promissory Note the senior secured debt of the Company.

On
March 24
 2017
 Dan Jeffery provided the Company with notice of his resignation from the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors (the
&ldquo;Board&rdquo;)
 effective immediately. Mr. Jeffery&rsquo;s resignation from the Board was not the result of any dispute
or disagreement with the Company. Mr. Jeffery has served on the Board since 2015.

Due
to the ongoing liquidity needs of the Company
 on March 28
 2017
 the Company entered into a promissory note with Mr. Kahn and
Mr. Garfinkle as the lenders in the original principal amount of $35
000 (the &ldquo;Promissory Note&rdquo;). The Promissory Note
accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to 5%. Accrued and unpaid interest on the outstanding principal is payable monthly
in arrears on the last business day of each month in which any amount remains outstanding under the Promissory Note. The principal
amount
 together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon
 is required to be repaid to the lenders out of the proceeds received
from the accounts receivable of the Company collected after March 28
 2017
 immediately upon such receipt. The loan under the
Promissory Note is secured by all of the assets of the Company pursuant to a Security Agreement and a Patent Security Agreement.

The
proceeds of the Promissory Note were used by the Company to primarily fund payroll and to pay certain critical vendors of the
Company.

As
a condition to the making of the loan under the Promissory Note
 the lenders under a loan agreement entered into by the Company
on February 1
 2017 (which lenders included Mr. Kahn and Mr. Garfinkle through GKS Funding)
 which is the senior secured debt
of the Company
 were required to enter into a subordination agreement with the Company and Mr. Kahn and Mr. Garfinkle (the &ldquo;Subordination
Agreement&rdquo;). The Subordination Agreement made the Promissory Note the senior secured debt of the Company.

On
March 31
 2017
 Jonathan Kahn and Morris Garfinkle provided Agritech Worldwide
 Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) with notices
of their resignation from the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors (the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;) and Jonathan Kahn&rsquo;s resignation
as the Company&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer
 effective immediately. Messrs. Garfinkle and Kahn&rsquo;s resignations were not
the result of any dispute or disagreement with the&nbsp;Company.

On
March 31
 2017
 the Company received a notice of default from GKS Funding LLC
 as administrative agent under the Loan Agreement
(as defined below) (&ldquo;GKS Funding&rdquo;) stating that the Company is in default of a loan (the &ldquo;Loan&rdquo;) made
pursuant to that certain Loan and Security Agreement by and among the Company
 GKS Funding and the lenders named therein
 which
include Messrs. Garfinkle and Kahn (the &ldquo;Lenders&rdquo;)
 dated as of February 1
 2017 (the &ldquo;Loan Agreement&rdquo;)
for failure to make a scheduled interest payment on the Loan that was due on March 31
 2017. If such failure described above is
not cured within the 15-day cure period
 which is April 15
 2017
 the Lenders (through GKS Funding
 as administrative agent under
the Loan Agreement) intend to exercise all rights and remedies available to them under the Loan Agreement
 related note and applicable
law
 which will include foreclosing on the collateral under the Loan Agreement.


 2017
 the Company and GKS Funding
as administrative agent under the Loan Agreement (as defined above) entered into a Cooperation Agreement (the &ldquo;Cooperation
Agreement&rdquo;) in connection with a loan (the &ldquo;Loan&rdquo;) made to the Company pursuant to that certain Loan and Security
Agreement
 dated as of February 1
 2017 (as amended and in effect from time to time
 the &ldquo;Loan Agreement&rdquo;)
 between
the Company
 the Lenders party thereto and GKS Funding. As previously reported
 on March 31
 2017
 the Company received a notice
of default from GKS Funding stating that the Company was in default of the Loan for failure to make a scheduled interest payment
on the Loan that was due on March 31
 2017. If such failure described above was not cured within the 15-day cure period
 which
was April 15
 2017
 the Lenders (through GKS Funding
 as administrative agent under the Loan Agreement) intended to exercise all
rights and remedies available to them under the Loan Agreement
 related note and applicable law
 which included foreclosing on
the collateral under the Loan Agreement.

As
of the date of the Cooperation Agreement
 the outstanding balance of the Company&rsquo;s obligations under the Loan Agreement
was approximately $1
011
800
 plus accrued and accruing legal fees and expenses. Over the past several months
 the Company has
experienced significant operating losses and has been unable to raise additional capital in order to pay the expenses necessary
to continue to operate its business. For the same reason
 the Company was unable to pay interest on the Loan on March 31
 2017
(the &ldquo;Existing Default&rdquo;).

As
a result of the foregoing
 and after considering all options
 the Board of Directors of the Company determined that the Company
will not have sufficient funds to cure the Existing Default on or before April 15
 2017. In addition
 given the inability to raise
additional capital to fund ongoing operations
 the Company also determined that it would be unable continue to operate as a going
concern. Thus
 the Company determined that it was in the best interests of all constituents and the Company to cooperate with
GKS Funding and its exercise of remedies.

Pursuant
to the Cooperation Agreement
 the Company and GKS Funding agreed as follows: (i) the Company waived the 15-day cure period with
respect to the Existing Default immediately upon execution of the Cooperation Letter and GKS Funding has the right to exercise
its remedies under the Loan Agreement and applicable law with respect to such event of default
 including
 without limitation
by scheduling and conducting a sale of all of the collateral under the Loan Agreement on or about April 17
 2017 (the &ldquo;UCC
Sale&rdquo;); (ii) GKS Funding agreed to fund loans to the Company up to the date of the UCC Sale to permit the Company to pay
the Budgeted Expenses (as defined in the Cooperation Agreement) as and when due with this new loan
 which is (a) secured by a
first priority security interest in all of the real and personal assets
 property
 fixtures
 rights and interests of the Company
(b) shall have priority in payment over the Loan made pursuant to the Loan Agreement; and (c) shall be repaid
 before any other
payments are made by the Company
 out of the first cash proceeds of the collateral received by the Company; and (iii) the Company
consented to fully cooperate with GKS Funding in connection with the UCC Sale
 as well as the exercise by GKS Funding of any of
its other right and remedies in connection therewith.



    
    



On
April&nbsp;5
 2017
 the Company and GKS Funding entered into a letter agreement
 a copy of which is attached to a Schedule 13D
and is incorporated by reference herein&nbsp;(the &ldquo;Letter Agreement&rdquo;)
 pursuant to which (i)&nbsp;the Company informed
GKS Funding that the Company has determined (1)&nbsp;it will not have sufficient funds to cure the interest payment default that
occurred on March&nbsp;31
 2017
 under the Loan Agreement and the Note as previously described in Amendment No.&nbsp;2 and (2)&nbsp;it
cannot continue to operate as a going concern and (ii)&nbsp;the Company and GKS Funding agreed as follows:

(1)
The Company waived the cure period with respect to the Existing Default (as defined in the Letter Agreement). As a result
 the
Company agreed
 immediately upon execution of the Letter Agreement
 the Existing Default became an Event of Default (as defined
in the Loan Agreement) (with
 for avoidance of doubt
 no further right to cure or grace period)
 and GKS Funding shall have the
right to exercise its remedies under the Loan Agreement and applicable law with respect to such Event of Default
 including
 without
limitation
 by scheduling and conducting a UCC sale of all of the Collateral (as defined in the Loan Agreement) on or about April&nbsp;17
2017 (the &ldquo;UCC Sale&rdquo;).

(2)
GKS Funding agreed to fund loans to the Company up to the date of the UCC Sale to permit the Company to pay the Budgeted Expenses
(as defined in the Letter Agreement) as and when due and payable in accordance with&nbsp;Exhibit A&nbsp;to the Letter Agreement
pursuant to documentation in form and substance acceptable to GKS Funding and Company (the &ldquo;New Loans&rdquo;). The New Loans:
(a)&nbsp;shall be secured by a first priority security interest in all of the real and personal assets
 property
 fixtures
 rights
and interests of the Company
 whether now existing or owned and hereafter arising or acquired and wherever located; (b)&nbsp;shall
have priority in payment over the Loans (as defined in the Loan Agreement) made by GKS Funding pursuant to the Loan Agreement;
and (c)&nbsp;shall be repaid
 before any other payments are made by the Company
 out of the first cash proceeds of the Collateral
received by the Company.

(3)
The Company consents to
 and shall fully cooperate with GKS Funding in connection with
 the UCC Sale and the disposition of the
Collateral in connection therewith
 as well as the exercise by GKS Funding of any of its other right and remedies in connection
therewith.


to try to acquire all of the Collateral at the UCC Sale. GKS Funding also intends to credit bid the amounts due under the Loan
Agreement and the Note at the UCC Sale. The effects of the contemplated transaction have not been reflected in the financial statements.

The
New Loans will be evidenced by a promissory note in the form attached hereto to a Schedule 13D and is incorporated by reference
herein&nbsp;(the &ldquo;New Note&rdquo;). The New Note will accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to 5%. Accrued and unpaid
interest on the outstanding principal is payable monthly in arrears on the last business day of each month in which any amount
remains outstanding under the New Note. The principal amount
 together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon
 is required
to be repaid to GKS Funding out of the proceeds received from the accounts receivable of the Company collected after April&nbsp;7
2017
 immediately upon such receipt. The New Note will be secured by all of the assets of the Company pursuant to a Security Agreement
and a Patent Security Agreement in the forms attached to a Schedule 13D and are incorporated by reference herein.

The
proceeds of the $60
000 New Loans that will be made on April&nbsp;7
 2017
 will be used by the Company to pay critical vendors
of the Company and for the Company to fund payroll.

As
a condition to the making of the loan under the New Note
 GKS Funding will require the lenders under the Loan Agreement (which
include GKS Funding) to enter into a subordination agreement with the Company and GKS Funding (the &ldquo;New Subordination Agreement&rdquo;).
The New Subordination Agreement will make the New Note the senior secured debt of the Company
 provided that the balance of the
Second Promissory Note
 which is less than $300
 will be senior to the New Note until paid in full. The form of the New Subordination
Agreement is attached to a Schedule 13D and is incorporated by reference herein.

foregoing descriptions of the New Note
 the Security Agreement
 the Patent Security Agreement and the New Subordination Agreement
are qualified in their entirety by reference to the New Note
 the Security Agreement
 the Patent Security Agreement and the New
Subordination Agreement
 which are attached to a Schedule 13D and is incorporated by reference herein.

All
additional New Loans made to the Company by GKS Funding after April&nbsp;7
 2017
 pursuant to the Letter Agreement will be made
on the same terms and conditions as set forth in the New Note
