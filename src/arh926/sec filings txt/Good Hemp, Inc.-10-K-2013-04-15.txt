We are currently a start-up exploration stage company in the business of gold and mineral exploration
 acquisition and development. Our principal office is located at 6565 Americas Parkway NE
 Suite 200
 Albuquerque
 New Mexico 87110. Our telephone number is (505) 563-5828.


We were incorporated in the State of Nevada under the name Keyser Resources
 Inc. on November 26
 2007.&#160;&#160;Our business was initially to acquire an option to purchase a mining interest in Canada. After a change in control in November 2010
 the Company explored a merger with another company in order to obtain an option to purchase several oil and gas leases in Nevada. A merger agreement was signed in January 2011.&#160;&#160;The then-current management of the Company decided not to pursue the merger
 and the merger agreement was terminated by mutual agreement of the parties as of March 18
 2011.


On March 29
 2011
 the Company underwent another change in management.&#160;&#160;On March 29
 2011
 Daniel M. Ferris was elected to serve as the sole director.&#160;&#160;Mr. Ferris subsequently appointed himself President
 Secretary and Treasurer.


Following the appointment of Daniel M. Ferris as sole director and officer of the Company
 the Company has changed its focus to that of a company engaged in the acquisition
 exploration and development of gold and silver mining properties.&#160;&#160;To further reflect this change in business focus
 the Company changed its name to &#8220;Lone Star Gold
 Inc.&#8221; on June 14
 2011.&#160;&#160;In addition
 to create a more flexible capital structure
 the Company increased the number of authorized shares of its Common Stock from 75
000
000 to 150
000
000 on June 14
 2011.&#160;&#160;A 20:1 forward stock split was declared to stockholders of record as of June 17
 2011.








Metales HBG
 S.A. de C.V. (&#8220;Metales&#8221;) was formed under the laws of Mexico on May 31
 2011.&#160;&#160;We own 70% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Metales while the remaining 30% are held by Homero Bustillos Gonzalez
 a resident of Mexico (&#8220;Gonzalez&#8221;).&#160;&#160;On June 10
 2011
 Gonzalez assigned to Metales eight gold and silver mining concessions (the &#8220;Concessions&#8221;) covering property located in the town of Guachochi
 state of Chihuahua
 Mexico.&#160;&#160;The Concessions cover 800 hectares
 or approximately 1
976 acres.


Gonzalez transferred the Concessions to Metales pursuant to an agreement previously entered into with a third party
 American Gold Holdings
 Ltd.
 a company formed under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (&#8220;American Gold&#8221;).&#160;&#160;American Gold paid Gonzalez an aggregate of $125
000 prior to the formation of Metales
 as required by its agreement with Gonzalez.&#160;&#160;On August 17
 2011
 in connection with its investment in Metales and the exploration and development of the Concessions
 the Company
 American Gold
 and Gonzalez executed an Assignment Agreement (the &#8220;Assignment Agreement&#8221;) pursuant to which (a) American Gold assigned to the Company all of its right and interest in and to a Letter of Intent between American Gold and Gonzalez
 and an Option to Purchase Agreement between American Gold and Gonzalez dated January 11
 2011 (the &#8220;Option Agreement&#8221;)
 (b) the Company accepted the assignment of all of the rights and interest of American Gold in and to the Letter of Intent and the Option Agreement
 and (c) the Company assumed all of the duties and obligations of American Gold under the Letter of Intent and the Option Agreement with Gonzalez.&#160;&#160;In connection with the execution of the Assignment Agreement
 American Gold released any claims against the Company
 Metales or Gonzalez in connection with the (i) $125
000 payment it made to Gonzalez
 (ii) the Letter of Intent or the Option Agreement
 or (iii) the Assignment Agreement.















Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement
 the Company has taken or has agreed to take the following actions that are required under the Option Agreement and the Letter of Intent
 in connection with transfer of the Concessions to Metales:












The Company has issued 125
000 shares of its Common Stock to North American Gold Corp
 a company organized under the laws of the Marshall Islands (&#8220;North American&#8221;)
 as repayment of the $125
000 that American Gold paid Gonzalez in connection with the Option Agreement.&#160;&#160;The shares were issued to North American in satisfaction of the Company&#8217;s obligations under the Assignment Agreement
 at the direction of American Gold.















The Company has issued 300
000 shares of its Common Stock to Gonzalez.















The Company has paid Gonzalez an additional $125
000.















The Company
 either alone or through Metales
 is obligated to fund $150
000 per year of development costs for three years
 for a total of $450
000 (the &#8220;Work Plan&#8221;).&#160;&#160;Pursuant to a verbal agreement
 Work Plan payments further have been put on hold until such time as the Company has sufficient capital to continue the project.





Gonzalez retains a 2% Net Smelter Returns Royalty on the Concessions.&#160;&#160;In addition
 the Company is obligated to issue 1
000
000 shares of its Common Stock to Gonzalez upon the discovery of a 1 million-ounce equivalent gold deposit
 as defined by industry standards as set forth by a recognized exchange in North America.&#160;&#160;Metales is obligated to undertake work necessary to bring the existing geological survey on the property up to NI 43-101 standards.&#160;&#160;Finally
 the Company has granted anti-dilution rights to Gonzalez
 such that the Company must allow Gonzalez the opportunity to maintain his percentage stock ownership in the Company until the date on which the Company has complied fully with its obligations under the Option Agreement or January 11
 2014
 whichever comes first.&#160;&#160;Gonzalez has waived the exercise of his anti-dilution rights with respect to issuances of Common Stock to North American under an investment agreement we entered into with North American on August 29

Non-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to the Company
These financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the recoverability of long-lived assets and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts
 historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company&#146;s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results
. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at rates of exchange in effect at the date of the transaction. Average monthly rates are used to translate revenues and expenses. Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of income. The Company has not

The Company&#146;s financial instruments consist principally of cash and accounts payable. Pursuant to ASC 820
 and ASC 825
 the fair value of cash equivalents is determined based on &#147;Level 1&#148; inputs
The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260
 which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (&#147;EPS&#148;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS
The Company has been in the exploration stage since its formation on November 26
 2007 and has not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations. It is primarily engaged in the acquisition
 exploration and development of mineral properties. Mineral properties includes the cost of advance minimum royalty payments
 the cost of capitalized mineral property leases
 and the cost of property acquired either by cash payment
 the issuance of term debt or common shares. Expenditures for exploration on specific properties with no proven reserves are written off as incurred. Mineral property costs will be amortized against future revenues or charged to operations at the time the related property is determined to have an impairment in value. Capitalized acquisition costs are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the mineral property has no future economic value. Capitalized amounts may also be written down if future cash flows
 including potential sales proceeds related to the property
 are estimated to be less than the carrying value of the property. The Company reviews the carrying value of mineral property interests periodically
 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable
 reductions in the carrying value of each property would be recorded to the extent the carrying value of the investment exceeds the property&#146;s estimated fair value. In the event that a mineral property is acquired through the issuance of the Company&#146;s shares
 the mineral property will be recorded at the fair value of the respective property or the fair value of the common shares
When mineral properties are acquired under option agreements with future acquisition payments to be made at the sole discretion of the Company
 those future payments
 whether in cash or shares
 are recorded only when the Company has made or is obliged to make the payment or issue the shares. When it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves and bankable feasibility
 the costs incurred to develop such property are capitalized.

 but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset
Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use

 two to three years; buildings and improvements
 five to 15 years; leasehold improvements
 two to 10 years; and furniture and equipment

In May 2011
 the FASB issued guidance to amend the accounting and disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. &nbsp;The new guidance limits the highest-and-best-use measure to nonfinancial assets
 permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis
 and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts. Additionally
 the new guidance expands the disclosures on Level 3 inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions
 as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs. The new guidance was effective for us beginning January 1
 2012. &nbsp;Other than requiring additional disclosures
In January 2010

 2012.&nbsp; The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

 excluding items classified as marketable securities
 include short-term
 highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash
 and so near their maturity that they present minimal risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally
 only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example
 both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However
 a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months. Compensating balance arrangements that do not legally restrict the withdrawal or usage of cash amounts may be reported as Cash and Cash Equivalents
 while legally restricted deposits held as compensating balances against borrowing arrangements
 contracts entered into with others
 or company statements of intention with regard to particular deposits are not generally reported as cash and cash equivalents. Includes cash and cash equivalents associated with the entity's continuing operations. Excludes cash and cash equivalents associated with the disposal group (and discontinued operation).

 Metales HBG
 S.A. de C.V. (&#147;Metales&#148;)
 a company organized under the laws of Mexico
 was formed
 with the Company owning 70% of the issued and outstanding capital stock.&nbsp; The remaining 30% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Metales was issued to Homero Bustillos Gonzalez (&#147;Gonzalez&#148;)

These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis
 which implies the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated any revenue since inception and has never paid any dividends and is unlikely to pay dividends or generate earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders and other investors
 the ability of the Company to obtain any necessary financing to continue operations
 and the attainment of profitable operations. As of December 31
 2012
 the Company has accumulated losses of $3
671
447 since inception. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

 including costs of drilling exploratory wells and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells. Exploration costs may be incurred both before acquiring the related property (sometimes referred to in part as prospecting costs) and after acquiring the property. Principal types of exploration costs
 which include depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of exploration activities
 are: costs of topographical
 geographical and geophysical studies
 rights of access to properties to conduct those studies
 and salaries and other expenses of geologists
 geophysical crews
 and others conducting those studies. Collectively
 these are sometimes referred to as geological and geophysical or G&amp;G costs. Exploration costs also include costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties
 such as delay rentals
 ad valorem taxes on properties
 legal costs for title defense
 the maintenance of land and lease records
 dry hole contributions and bottom hole contributions
 costs of drilling and equipping exploratory wells and costs of drilling exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells.

On August 29
 2011
 the Company and North American Gold Corp.
 a company organized under the laws of the Marshall Islands (&#147;North American&#148;)
 executed an Investment Agreement (the &#147;North American Investment Agreement&#148;). Under the North American Investment Agreement
 North American agreed to invest up to $15
000
000 to purchase shares of the Common Stock in increments of $100
000 or an integral multiple thereof
 at the Company&#146;s option at any time through August 31
 2013 (the &#147;Open Period&#148;). &nbsp;During the Open Period
 the Company has the option to deliver a put notice (a &#147;Put Notice&#148;) to North American that states the number of shares of Common Stock the Company proposes to sell to North American (the &#147;Put Shares&#148;)
The original North American Investment Agreement required the Company to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Put Shares to fund the exploration and development of gold and silver mining concessions in the La Candelaria project in Chihuahua
 Mexico. On November 9
 2011
 the Company and North American executed a First Amendment to the North American Investment Agreement
 which states that the Company shall use the net proceeds from the sale of Put Shares to fund operating expenses
 working capital and general corporate activities related to the exploration and development of gold and silver mining concessions held by the Company and/or a subsidiary in relation to the La Candelaria property
 the Ocampo property
The sales of Put Shares will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933
 but will be issued under an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. Any Put Shares issued and sold to North American will be &#147;restricted securities&#148; and will be subject to applicable restrictions on resale.&nbsp; However
On April 30
 2012
 the Company entered into an Investment Agreement with Fairhills Capital Offshore Ltd.
 a Cayman Islands exempted company (&#147;Fairhills&#148;)
 as amended by Amendments No. 1 and No. 2 to Investment Agreement dated June 25
 2012 and September 21
 2012
 respectively (as amended
 the Deer Valley Investment Agreement)
 pursuant to which Fairhills has agreed to purchase shares of Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of up to $15
000
The Deer Valley Investment Agreement provides that the Company may
 from time to time during the Open Period (defined below)
 in its sole discretion
 deliver a put notice to Fairhills which states the dollar amount that the Company intends to sell to Fairhills on a date specified in the put notice. The maximum investment amount per notice shall be no more than two hundred percent (200%) of the average daily volume of the Common Stock for the ten consecutive trading days immediately prior to date of the applicable put notice. The purchase price per share to be paid by Fairhills will be calculated at a twenty-four and a half percent (24.5%) discount to the lowest trading price of the Common Stock reported by Bloomberg
 L.P. during the ten (10) consecutive trading days immediately prior to Fairhills receipt of the put notice. The Open Period begins on the trading day after a registration statement is declared effective as to the Common Stock to be subject to the put
 and ends thirty-six (36) months after such date
 unless earlier terminated in accordance with the Deer Valley Investment Agreement. The Company has reserved 30
000
The Company will use the proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock under the Deer Valley Investment Agreement for general corporate and working capital purposes and acquisitions or assets
 businesses or operations or for other purposes that the Board of Directors
 in its good faith
On October 16
 2012
 the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 covering the resale of 19
000
000 shares of Common Stock subject to the Deer Valley Investment Agreement (Note 11).&nbsp; Fairhills assigned their interest to Deer Valley Management on November 12
 2012.&nbsp; The registration statement was declared effective in December 2012.

Non-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to the Company
 and in represented in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of stockholders&#146; equity.&nbsp; Non-controlling interests in the results of operations of the Company are presented in the face of the consolidated statement of operations as an allocation of the total profit or loss between non-controlling interests and the shareholders of the Company.


        
These financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
 and are expressed in US dollars. The Company&#146;s fiscal year-end is December 31.


        
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the recoverability of long-lived assets and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts
 historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company&#146;s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results
 future results of operations will be affected.


        
        


        
. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at rates of exchange in effect at the date of the transaction. Average monthly rates are used to translate revenues and expenses. Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of income. The Company has not
 to the date of these financial statements
 entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.


        
The Company&#146;s financial instruments consist principally of cash and accounts payable. Pursuant to ASC 820
 and ASC 825
 the fair value of cash equivalents is determined based on &#147;Level 1&#148; inputs
 which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company believes that the recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and relatively short maturity dates or durations.


        
The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260
 which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (&#147;EPS&#148;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS
 the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti dilutive.


        
The Company has been in the exploration stage since its formation on November 26
 2007 and has not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations. It is primarily engaged in the acquisition
 exploration and development of mineral properties. Mineral properties includes the cost of advance minimum royalty payments
 the cost of capitalized mineral property leases
 and the cost of property acquired either by cash payment
 the issuance of term debt or common shares. Expenditures for exploration on specific properties with no proven reserves are written off as incurred. Mineral property costs will be amortized against future revenues or charged to operations at the time the related property is determined to have an impairment in value. Capitalized acquisition costs are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the mineral property has no future economic value. Capitalized amounts may also be written down if future cash flows
 including potential sales proceeds related to the property
 are estimated to be less than the carrying value of the property. The Company reviews the carrying value of mineral property interests periodically
 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable
 reductions in the carrying value of each property would be recorded to the extent the carrying value of the investment exceeds the property&#146;s estimated fair value. In the event that a mineral property is acquired through the issuance of the Company&#146;s shares
 the mineral property will be recorded at the fair value of the respective property or the fair value of the common shares
When mineral properties are acquired under option agreements with future acquisition payments to be made at the sole discretion of the Company
 those future payments
 whether in cash or shares
 are recorded only when the Company has made or is obliged to make the payment or issue the shares. When it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves and bankable feasibility
 the costs incurred to develop such property are capitalized.


        
        
 Property Plant and Equipment
 but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset
Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use
 three years; computer equipment
 two to three years; buildings and improvements
 five to 15 years; leasehold improvements
 two to 10 years; and furniture and equipment
 one to five years. Land is not depreciated.


        
 Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations

 abandonment or other disposal of long-lived tangible assets arising from the acquisition
 construction or development and for normal operations of such assets. As at December 31
 2012 and 2011
 the Company has not recognized any asset retirement obligations.


        
Potential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The Company has adopted ASC 740



        
In accordance with ASC 718

 the Company accounts for share-based payments using the fair value method. The Company has not issued any stock options since its inception. Common shares issued to third parties for non-cash consideration are valued based on the fair market value of the services provided or the fair market value of the Common Stock on the measurement date
 whichever is more readily determinable.

 the Company has no items that represent a comprehensive loss and
 therefore
 has not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the financial statements.


        
In June 2011
 the FASB issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income. The new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity. Instead
 an entity will be required to present either a continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The new guidance was effective for us beginning July 1
In May 2011
 the FASB issued guidance to amend the accounting and disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. &nbsp;The new guidance limits the highest-and-best-use measure to nonfinancial assets
 permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis
 and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts. Additionally
 the new guidance expands the disclosures on Level 3 inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions
 as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs. The new guidance was effective for us beginning January 1
 2012. &nbsp;Other than requiring additional disclosures
In January 2010
 the FASB issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements.&nbsp; The guidance requires the disclosure of roll forward activities on purchases
 sales
 issuance
 and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value measurements).&nbsp; The guidance was effective for us as of January 1
 2012.&nbsp; The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

000.&nbsp; The Securities Purchase Agreement

 (the &#147;Fairhills SPA&#148;) entered into between the Company and Fairhills provides that in the event that the value of the Shares is less than $50
000 at the earlier of (a) the effective date of a registration statement or (b) such time as the Shares can be sold pursuant to Rule 144 (the &#147;Triggering Date&#148;)

The Price Protection Clause gives rise to a derivative.&nbsp; We have measured this derivative at fair value and recognize the derivative value as a current liability and recorded the derivative value on our consolidated balance sheet. The derivative is valued primarily using models based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little to no market activity.&nbsp; These inputs represent management&#146;s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the liability at the measurement date and thus are classified as Level 3. Changes in the fair values of the derivative are recognized in earnings in the current period.&nbsp; During the year ended December 31
 2012
 the Company recorded a derivative liability of $20
980 related to the Price Protection Clause.&nbsp;&nbsp; At December 21
 2012
 the effective date of the registration statement
 the price protection feature was triggered and additional shares were valued at approximately $30
000.&nbsp; These additional shares have not been issued.

 excluding items classified as marketable securities
 include short-term
 highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash
 and so near their maturity that they present minimal risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally
 only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example
 both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However
 a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months. Compensating balance arrangements that do not legally restrict the withdrawal or usage of cash amounts may be reported as Cash and Cash Equivalents
 while legally restricted deposits held as compensating balances against borrowing arrangements
 contracts entered into with others
 or company statements of intention with regard to particular deposits are not generally reported as cash and cash equivalents. Includes cash and cash equivalents associated with the entity's continuing operations. Excludes cash and cash equivalents associated with the disposal group (and discontinued operation).
