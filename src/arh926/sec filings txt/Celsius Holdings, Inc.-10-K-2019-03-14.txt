 grape
 kiwi-guava and watermelon
(which are carbonated)
 and non-carbonated green tea raspberry/acai
 and green tea/peach mango. Celsius&reg; is packaged in a
distinctive 12 ounce sleek can that uses vivid colors in abstract patterns to create a strong on-shelf impact. The cans are sold
as singles or in four-packs. We have recently redesigned our packaging to provide a cleaner
 crisper and more modern look. We
also sell a powdered form of the active ingredients in our beverages in individual On-The-Go packets as well as multiple serving
canisters. In addition to being sugar free
 our original ready-to -drink product line is non-GMO
 kosher and vegan certified and
soy and gluten free.

In
2018
 Celsius introduced its first product line extension focused on broadening the reach of Celsius&reg; into the natural channel.
The natural line extension is available in refreshing flavors: three sparkling - grapefruit
 cucumber lime
 orange pomegranate
and three non-carbonated - pineapple coconut
 watermelon berry and strawberries &amp; cream. The natural line extension boasts
a clean ingredient panel featuring 100% natural caffeine-from-green-coffee bean extract
 and an all-natural sweetener. Like the
original Celsius&reg; products
 our new natural ready-to -drink beverages are non-GMO
 kosher and vegan certified and soy and
gluten free.

During
2018
 we also introduced the second line in our product portfolio
 trainer&rsquo;s grade Celsius Heat&trade;. Celsius Heat&trade;
is also a dietary supplement
 that uses the same proprietary thermogenic MetaPlus&reg; formula as Celsius&reg;
 which is proven
to accelerate metabolism
 boost energy and accelerate calorie and fat burn when combined with exercise. Celsius Heat&trade;
 which
is packed with 2
000mg of L-citrulline and 300mg of caffeine. Comes in seven carbonated flavors: Apple Jack&rsquo;d
 Orangesicle
Inferno Punch
 Cherry Lime
 Blueberry Pomegranate
 Strawberry Dragonfruit
 and Tangerine Grapefruit.

We
target a niche in the functional beverage segment of the beverage industry consisting of consumers seeking calorie-burning beverages
to help them manage their weight and enhance their exercise regimen. Our target consumers are generally individuals that exercise
two to five times a week and are concerned about their health.



    
    


Clinical
Studies

It
is our belief that clinical studies substantiating product claims will become more important as more and more beverages are marketed
 was one of the first functional beverages to be launched along with a clinical study.
 is also one of very few functional beverages that has clinical research on the actual product itself.
Some beverage companies that do mention studies backing their claims are referencing independent studies conducted on one or more
of the ingredients in the product. We believe that it is important and will become more important to have studies on the actual
product.

We
. Each was conducted by a research organization and each
 formula. The first study was conducted by the Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science
&amp; Sports Nutrition. The remaining studies were conducted by the Applied Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Physiology Laboratory
of the University of Oklahoma. We funded all of the studies and provided Celsius&reg; beverage for the studies. However
 none
of our directors
 executive officers or principal shareholders is in any way affiliated with either of the two research organizations
which conducted the studies.

The
.
The Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science &amp; Sports Nutrition is a multidisciplinary clinical research team dedicated to
exploring the relationship between exercise
 nutrition
 dietary supplements and health. This placebo-controlled
 double-blind
 and the placebo on metabolic rate. Twenty-two participants were
 and on a separate day a serving of twelve ounces of
. All subjects completed both trials using a randomized
 counterbalanced design. Randomized means that
subjects were selected for each group randomly to ensure that the different treatments were statistically equivalent. Counterbalancing
 on the second day. The
other group did the opposite. Counterbalancing is a design method that is used to control &ldquo;order effects.&rdquo; In other
words
 this was done to make sure that the order that subjects were served does not impact the results and analysis.

Metabolic
rate (via indirect calorimetry
 measurements taken from breaths into and out of calorimeter) and substrate oxidation (via respiratory
exchange ratios) were measured at baseline (pre-ingestion) and for ten minutes at the end of each hour for three hours post-ingestion.
The results showed an average increase of metabolism of twelve percent over the three-hour period
 compared to a statistically
insignificant change for the control group. Metabolic rate
 or metabolism
 is the rate at which the body expends energy. This
is also referred to as the &ldquo;caloric burn rate.&rdquo; Indirect calorimetry calculates heat that living organisms produce
from their production of carbon dioxide. It is called &ldquo;indirect&rdquo; because the caloric burn rate is calculated from
a measurement of oxygen uptake. Direct calorimetry would involve the subject being placed inside the calorimeter for the measurement
to determine the heat being produced. Respiratory Exchange Ratio is the ratio oxygen taken in a breath compared to the carbon
dioxide breathed out in one breath or exchange. Measuring this ratio can be used for estimating which substrate (fuel such as
carbohydrate or fat) is being metabolized or &lsquo;oxidized&rsquo; to supply the body with energy.

The
second study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2007.
This blinded
 placebo-controlled study was conducted on a total of 60 men and women of normal weight. An equal number of participants
 to a placebo of the same
amount. According to the study
 burned significantly more calories versus those
consuming the placebo
 over a three-hour period. The study confirmed that over the three-hour period
 subjects consuming a single
 burned 65% more calories than those consuming the placebo beverage and burned an average of
more than 100 to 140 calories compared to the placebo. These results were statistically significant.

The
third study
 conducted by the Applied Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2007
 extended
our second study with the same group of 60 individuals and protocol for 28 days and showed the same statistical significance of
increased calorie burn (minimal attenuation). While the University of Oklahoma study did extend for 28 days
 more testing would
 calorie-burning effects. Also
 although these studies were on
relatively small numbers of subjects
 they have statistically significant results. Additional studies on a larger number and wider
range of body compositions can be considered to further the analysis.

Our
fourth study
 conducted by the Applied Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009
 combined
 use with exercise. This ten-week placebo-controlled
 randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total


 and Group 2 consumed one serving of an identically flavored and labeled placebo beverage. Both groups participated
in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training
 following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training
 prior to exercising
may enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition
 cardio-respiratory fitness and endurance performance. According
to the preliminary findings
 lost significantly more fat mass and
gained significantly more muscle mass than those subjects consuming the placebo &mdash; a 93.75% greater loss in fat and 50% greater
gain in muscle mass
 respectively. The study also confirmed that subjects consuming Celsius&reg; significantly improved measures
of cardio-respiratory fitness and the ability to delay the onset of fatigue when exercising to exhaustion.



    
    


Our
fifth study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009.
This ten-week placebo-controlled
 randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 27 previously sedentary overweight
and obese female subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into groups that consumed identically tasting treatment beverages
with exercise or without exercise. All participants consumed one drink
 either placebo or Celsius
 per day for
10 weeks. The exercise groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training
 following the American College
of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. No changes were made to their diet. The results showed
 prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and
enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition. According to the preliminary findings
 subjects consuming a
 lost significantly more fat mass and gained significantly more muscle mass when compared
to exercise alone &mdash; a 46% greater loss in fat
 27% greater gain in muscle mass
 respectively. The study also confirmed that
 significantly improved measures of cardio-respiratory fitness &mdash; 35% greater endurance
performance with significant improvements to lipid profiles &mdash; total cholesterol decreases of 5 to 13% and bad LDL cholesterol
12 to 18%. Exercise alone had no effect on blood lipid levels.

Our
sixth study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009.
This ten-week placebo-controlled
 randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 37 previously sedentary male subjects.
Participants were randomly assigned into groups that consumed identically tasting treatment beverages with exercise or without
exercise. All participants consumed one drink
 either placebo or Celsius
 per day for 10 weeks. The exercise groups
participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training
 following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines
of training for previously sedentary adults. No changes were made to their diet. The results showed that consuming a single serving
 prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the positive adaptations

 before exercise versus those that consumed the placebo
before exercise. Mood was not affected. Clinical markers for hepatic
 renal
 cardiovascular and immune function
 as determined
by pre-and post-blood work revealed no adverse effects.

Our
seventh study was conducted by Miami Research Institute in 2010 and demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the powders and the
shots. This study allows the Company to make the same structure/function claims as the ready to drink beverages.

Manufacture
and Supply of Our Products

Our
beverages are produced by established third party beverage co-packers. A co-packer is a manufacturing plant that provides the
service of filling bottles or cans for the brand owner. We believe one benefit of using co-packers is that we do not have to invest
in the production facility and can focus our resources on brand development
 sales and marketing. It also allows us produce in
multiple locations strategically placed throughout the country. We purchase most of the ingredients and all packaging materials.
 is specified
as 15 to 18 months.

Substantially
all of the raw materials used in the preparation
 bottling and packaging of our products are purchased by us or by our co-packers
in accordance with our specifications. Generally
 we obtain the ingredients used in our products from domestic suppliers and some
 include green tea (EGCG)
 ginger (from
the root)
 caffeine
 B vitamins
 vitamin C
 taurine
 guarana
 chromium
 calcium
 glucuronolactone
 sucralose
 natural flavors
 is labeled with a supplements facts panel. We have no major supply contracts with
any of our suppliers. We single-source all our ingredients for purchasing efficiency; however
 we have identified a second source
for our critical ingredients and there are many suppliers of flavors
 colorings and sucralose. In case of a supply restriction
or interruption from any of the flavor and coloring suppliers
 we would have to test and qualify other suppliers that may disrupt
our production schedules.

Packaging
materials
 except for our distinctive sleek aluminum cans
 are easily available from multiple sources in the United States; however
due to efficiencies we utilize single source vendor relationships.

We
believe that our co-packing arrangement and supply sources are adequate for our present needs.






is sold across many retail
segments. They include supermarkets
 convenience stores
 drug stores
 nutritional stores
 and mass merchants. We also sell to health
clubs
 spas
 gyms
 the military
 e-commerce websites and a limited number of international markets.




    
    


We
distribute our products domestically through a hybrid of direct-store delivery (DSD) distributors and as well as sales direct
to retailers (DTR).






 we distribute our products
through regional and country-specific distribution partners. During 2018
 we focused a significant part of our marketing efforts
on expanding our global reach into the Asian market
 which is one of the most dynamic and fastest-growing
 making it an important
target in our pursuit of global growth. Having a diverse
 established and expanding product line
 we increased our investment in
this key market with the launch and expansion of two important relationships and the formation of an experienced
 focused regional
team. In September 2017
 we entered China with our partner
 Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co.
&rdquo;).
With exciting success
 brand. The initial
distribution covered select channels across three Tier-1 cities - Beijing
 Guangzhou and Shenzhen
 as well as in over 30 other
cities across 14 provinces. Consumer response has been overwhelmingly positive and signals that our plan for broader product distribution
in China is in-line with market opportunities. At the same time
 we are also accelerating our distribution in Hong Kong through
our partnership with A.S. Watson Industries. The foundation of our business in Asia is with strong
 capable partners
 and we are
committed to building on our success to further grow our brand and increase placements of our products.


 2019
 we have restructured our China distribution efforts by entering into a license
and repayment of investment agreement with Qifeng
 thereby creating a risk-mitigated method of capturing market share in China.
Under the agreement
 Qifeng has been granted the exclusive license rights to manufacture
 market and commercialize Celsius&reg;
brand products in China. Qifeng pay a fixed royalty fee of $6.9 million for the five years
 transitioning to a volume-based royalty
fee
 thereafter. In addition
 Qifeng Food will repay all capital Celsius has invested into the China market to date
 over a five-year
period.

Sales
to one customer
 a foreign distributor of our products
 accounted for 16% and 30% of our revenues for the years ended December
31
 2018 and December 31
 2017
 respectively. Accordingly
 if sales to this customer were to significantly decline or cease entirely
our business
 results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.

Seasonality
of Sales 

As
is typical in the beverage industry
 sales of our beverages are seasonal
 with the highest sales volumes generally occurring in
the second and third fiscal quarters
 which correspond to the warmer months of the year in our major markets.



We
believe that we are one of the few calorie-burning fitness beverages whose effectiveness is supported by clinical studies
 which
gives us a unique position in the beverage market. However
 our products do compete broadly with all categories of consumer beverages.
The beverage market is highly competitive
 and includes international
 national
 regional and local producers and distributors
most of whom have greater financial
 management and other resources than us. Our direct competitors in the functional beverage
market include
 but are not limited to The Coca-Cola Company
 Dr. Pepper Snapple Group
 PepsiCo
 Inc.
 Nestl&eacute;
 Waters North
America
 Inc.
 Hansen Natural Corp.
 Monster Energy
 and Red Bull.

Proprietary
Rights

We
trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark
Office
 as well as a number of additional trademarks.

We
have and will continue to take appropriate measures
 such as entering into confidentiality agreements with our contract packers
and ingredient suppliers
 formulation and product
formulas.

We
 formulation and product formulas as trade secrets. We believe that trade secrecy is a preferable
method of protection for our formulas as patenting them might require their disclosure. Other than a company that is our outsourced
production manager
 no single member of the raw material supply chain or our co-packers has access to the complete formula.

We
consider our trademarks and trade secrets to be of considerable value and importance to our business. No successful challenges
to our registered trademarks have arisen and we have no reason to believe that any such challenges will arise in the future.

Government
Regulation

The
production

 Drug and Cosmetic Act
the 
 the 
 various environmental
statutes and various other federal
 state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production

safety
 advertising
 labeling and ingredients of such products. California law requires that a specific warning appear on any
product that contains a component listed by California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. The law exposes
all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products because the law recognizes
no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required. Consequently
 even trace amounts of listed
components can expose affected products to the prospect of warning labels. Products containing listed substances that occur naturally
in the product or that are contributed to the product solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning
requirement. While none of our products are required to display warnings under this law
 we cannot predict whether an important
component of any of our products might be added to the California list in the future. We also are unable to predict whether or
to what extent a warning under this law would have an impact on costs or sales of our products.


    
    


Measures
have been enacted in various localities and states that require that a deposit be charged for certain non-refillable beverage
containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other deposit
 recycling or product stewardship proposals
have been introduced in certain states and localities and in Congress
 and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations
may be proposed in the future at the local
 state and federal levels
 both in the United States and elsewhere.

Our
facilities in the United States are subject to federal
 state and local environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these
provisions has not had
 and we do not expect such compliance to have
 any material adverse effect upon our business
 financial
condition and results of operations.



As
of the date of this Report
 the Company employs 50 persons
 including its executive officers.



    
    


Our
business faces certain risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet
know of
 or that we currently think as immaterial
 may also impair our business. If any of the events anticipated by the risks
described below or elsewhere in this report occur
 our results of operations and financial conditions could be adversely affected.

Risk
Factors Relating to Our Business

We
have a history of losses and we may experience additional losses in the futures.

The
Company has a history of losses
 including net losses available to common shareholders of $11
419
781 and $8
606
578 for the years
ended December 31
 2018 and December 31
 2017
 respectively. Our future operating results will depend on many factors
 both in
and out of our control
 including the ability to increase and sustain demand for and acceptance of our products
 the level of
our competition
 and our ability to attract and maintain key management and key employees. Accordingly
 there can be no assurance
that we can attain consistent profitability.

We
rely on third party co-packers to manufacture our products. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our co-packers
and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us
 our business could suffer.

We
do not directly manufacture our products
 but instead outsource such manufacturing to established third party co-packers. These
third-party co-packers may not be able to fulfill our demand as it arises
 could begin to charge rates that make using their services
cost inefficient or may simply not be able to or willing to provide their services to us on a timely basis or at all. In the event
of any disruption or delay
 whether caused by a rift in our relationship or the inability of our co-packers to manufacture our
products as required
 we would need to secure the services of alternative co-packers. We may be unable to procure alternative
packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period and any such transition could
be costly. In such case
 our business
 financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.

We
rely on distributors to distribute our products in the DSD sales channel and in international markets. If we are unable to secure
such distributors and/or we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing distributors
 our business could suffer.

We
 in the DSD sales channel by entering into agreements with direct-to-store delivery distributors
having established sales
 marketing and distribution organizations. We similarly are seeking to expand our international distribution
particularly in the Far East and elsewhere in Asia by entering into agreements with large established distributors who service
those markets. Many of our distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other beverage products. In many
cases
 such products compete directly with our products. The marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success.
 proves to be less attractive to our distributors and/or if we fail to attract distributors
 and/or
our distributors do not market and promote our products with greater focus in preference to the products of our competitors
 our
business
 financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.



    
    


Our
customers are material to our success. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers
 our business
could suffer.

Unilateral
decisions could be taken by our distributors
 grocery chains
 convenience chains
 drug stores
 nutrition stores
 mass merchants
club warehouses and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at any time
 which
could cause our business to suffer.

One
customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues. If sales to this customer were to significantly decline or cease


Sales
to a foreign customer of our products accounted for 16% and 30% of our revenues for the years ended December 31
 2018 and December
31
 2017
 respectively. Accordingly
 if sales to this customer were to significantly decline or cease entirely
 our business
results of operations and financial condition may be significantly harmed.

Increases
in cost or shortages of raw materials or increases in costs of co-packing could harm our business

The
principal raw materials used by us are flavors and ingredient blends as well as aluminum cans
 the prices of which are subject
to fluctuations. We are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients we utilize
will rise in the future and whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. We do not use hedging agreements
or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. In addition
some of these raw materials
 such as our distinctive sleek 12 ounce can
 are available from a single or a limited number of suppliers.
As alternative sources of supply may not be available
 any interruption in the supply of such raw materials might materially harm
us.

Our
failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results.

We
may not correctly estimate demand for our products. If we materially underestimate demand for our products and are unable to secure
sufficient ingredients or raw materials
 we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis
 in which case our business
financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We
depend upon our trademarks and proprietary rights
 and any failure to protect our intellectual property rights or any claims that
we are infringing upon the rights of others may adversely affect our competitive position.

Our
success depends
 in large part
 on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual
property rights. We cannot be sure that trademarks will be issued with respect to any future trademark applications or that our
competitors will not challenge
 invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to
 or licensed by
 us.

Our
products are manufactured using our proprietary blends of ingredients. These blends are created by third-party suppliers to our
specifications and then supplied to our co-packers. Although all of the third parties in our supply and manufacture chain execute
confidentiality agreements
 there can be no assurance that our trade secrets
 including our proprietary ingredient blends will
not become known to competitors.

We
believe that our competitors
 many of whom are more established and have greater financial and personnel resources than we do
may be able to replicate or reverse engineer our processes
 brands
 flavors
 or our products in a manner that could circumvent
our protective safeguards. Therefore
 we cannot give you any assurance that our confidential business information will remain
proprietary. Any such loss of confidentiality could diminish or eliminate any competitive advantage provided by our proprietary
information.

We
may incur material losses as a result of product recall and product liability

We
may be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury
 illness or death. We also may be required to recall some
of our products if they become contaminated or are damaged or mislabeled. A significant product liability judgment against us
or a widespread product recall
 could have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations.
The amount of the insurance we carry is limited
 and that insurance is subject to certain exclusions and may or may not be adequate.

Our
lack of product diversification and inability to timely introduce new or alternative products could cause us to cease operations.

Our
 and our recent product line extensions
 including Celsius Heat&trade;. The risks
associated with focusing on a limited product line are substantial. Even though we recently announced our first product line extension
if consumers do not accept our products or if there is a general decline in market demand for
 or any significant decrease in
the consumption of functional beverages
 we are not financially or operationally capable of introducing alternative products within
a short time frame. As a result
 such lack of acceptance or market demand decline could cause us to cease operations.



    
    


We
are dependent on our key executives and employees and the loss of any of their services could materially adversely affect us which
may have a material adverse effect on our Company.

Our
future success will depend substantially upon the abilities of
 and personal relationships developed by our key executives and
employees. The sudden loss of the services of any key executive or employee could materially adversely affect our business and
our prospects for the future. We do not have key person insurance on the lives of such individuals.

We
are dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical
 sales and managerial personnel

Our
future success depends in part on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical
 sales and managerial
personnel. Competition for such personnel in the beverage industry is intense and we may not be able to retain our key managerial
sales and technical employees or attract and retain additional highly qualified technical
 sales and managerial personnel in the
future. Any inability to attract and retain the necessary technical
 sales and managerial personnel could materially adversely
affect us.

The
FDA has not passed on the efficacy of our products or the accuracy of any claim we make related to our products.

Although
six independent clinical studies have been conducted relating to the calorie-burning and related effects of our products
 the
results of these studies have not been submitted to or reviewed by the FDA. Further
 the FDA has not passed on the efficacy of
any of our products nor has it reviewed or passed on any claims we make related to our products
 including the claim that our
products aid consumers in burning calories or enhancing their metabolism.

Risk
Factors Relating to Our Industry

We
are subject to significant competition in the beverage industry

The
beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing
 packaging
 distribution channel penetration
development of new products and flavors and marketing campaigns. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by
a relatively large number of manufacturers
 most of which have substantially greater financial
 marketing and distribution resources
and name recognition than we do.

Important
factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products
 trade and consumer promotions
rapid and effective development of new
 unique cutting-edge products
 attractive and different packaging
 branded product advertising
and pricing. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially better financed
competitors
 including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers
 such as The Coca Cola Company
Dr. Pepper Snapple Group
 PepsiCo
 Inc.
 Nestle
 Waters North America
 Inc.
 Hansen Natural Corp. and Red Bull. We also compete
with companies that are smaller or primarily local in operation. Our products also compete with private label brands such as those
carried by supermarket chains
 convenience store chains
 drug store chains
 mass merchants and club warehouses.

There
can be no assurance that we will compete successfully in the functional beverage industry. The failure to do so would materially
adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.

We
compete in an industry that is brand-conscious
 so brand name recognition and acceptance of our products are critical to our success
and significant marketing and advertising could be needed to achieve and sustain brand recognition.

Our
business is substantially dependent upon awareness and market acceptance of our products and brands by our targeted consumers.
Our business depends on acceptance by our independent distributors of our brand as one that has the potential to provide incremental
sales growth rather than reduce distributors&rsquo; existing beverage sales. The development of brand awareness and market acceptance
is likely to require significant marketing and advertising expenditures. There can be no assurance that Celsius
will achieve and maintain satisfactory levels of acceptance by independent distributors and retail consumers. Any failure of the
 brand to maintain or increase acceptance or market penetration would likely have a material adverse effect
on business
 financial condition and results of operations.

Our
sales are affected by seasonality.

As
is typical in the beverage industry
 our sales are seasonal. Our highest sales volumes generally occur in the second and third
quarters
 which correspond to the warmer months of the year in our major markets. Consumer demand for our products is also affected
by weather conditions. Cool
 wet spring or summer weather could result in decreased sales of our beverages and could have an adverse
effect on our results of operations.

Our
business is subject to many regulations and noncompliance is costly

The
production
 marketing and sale of our beverage products are subject to the rules and regulations of various federal
 state and
local health agencies. If a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance
with any of these regulations
 we may be fined
 or production may be stopped
 thus adversely affecting our business
 financial
condition and results of operations. Similarly
 any adverse publicity associated with any noncompliance may damage our reputation
and our ability to successfully market our products. Furthermore
 the rules and regulations are subject to change from time to
time and while we closely monitor developments in this area
 we have no way of anticipating whether changes in these rules and
regulations will impact our business adversely. Additional or revised regulatory requirements
 whether labeling
 environmental
tax or otherwise
 could have an adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations.



    
    


Risk
Factors Relating to our Status as a Fully Reporting Public Company


We are subject to the periodic
reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;) that require us to incur audit fees
and legal fees in connection with the preparation of such reports. These additional costs could reduce or eliminate our ability
to earn a profit.


the Exchange Act and as a result
 we are now required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
&rdquo;) pursuant to the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. In order to comply
with these requirements
 our independent registered public accounting firm has to review our financial statements on a quarterly
basis and audit our financial statements on an annual basis. Moreover
 our legal counsel has to review and assist in the preparation
of such reports. The costs charged by these professionals for such services cannot be accurately predicted at this time because
factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports cannot be determined at
this time and will have a major effect on the amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys. However
 the incurrence
of such costs will obviously be an expense to our operations and thus have a negative effect on our ability to meet our overhead
requirements and earn a profit. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud
 our business and operating results
could be harmed
 investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information
 and the trading price of our common stock
if a market ever develops
 could drop significantly.


If
we do not maintain an effective internal control environment as well as adequate control procedures over our financial reporting
investor confidence may be adversely affected thereby affecting the value of our stock price

We
are required to maintain proper internal control over our financial reporting and adequate controls related to our disclosures.
As defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act
 internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by
 or under
the supervision of
 the principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the board of directors
 management
and other personnel
 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. If we fail to maintain adequate
controls
 our business
 the results of operations
 financial condition and/or the value of our stock may be adversely impacted.



    
    


Risk
Factors Related to our Common Stock

We
cannot guarantee the continued existence of an active established public trading market for our common stock.

Our
common stock currently is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Trading in stock quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market
may often experience wide fluctuations in trading prices
 due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or
business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance.


    
    


Market
prices for our common stock may also be influenced by a number of other factors
 including:



    
    
the
    issuance of new equity securities pursuant to a public or private offering;




    
    
changes
    in interest rates;




    
    
competitive
    developments
 including announcements by competitors of new products or services or significant contracts
 acquisitions
 strategic
    partnerships
 joint ventures or capital commitments;




    
    
variations
    in quarterly operating results;




    
    
change
    in financial estimates by securities analysts;




    
    
the
    depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;




    
    
investor
    perceptions of Celsius and the functional beverage industry generally; and




    
    
general
    economic and other national conditions.


Our
board of directors has the authority
 without shareholder approval
 to issue preferred stock with terms that may not be beneficial
to common shareholders and with the ability to affect adversely shareholder voting power and perpetuate their control over us.

Our
Articles of Incorporation allows our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action
by our shareholders. Our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred
stock. As a result
 our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders
the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation
 the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to
the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares
 together with a premium
 prior to the redemption of
our common stock.

The
ability of our principal shareholders to control our business may limit or eliminate minority shareholders&rsquo; ability to influence
corporate affairs.

Our
principal shareholders own common stock and/or preferred stock which holds a majority of the voting power of our issued and outstanding
capital. Accordingly
 they will be able to effectively control the election of directors
 as well as all other matters requiring
shareholder approval. The interests of our principal shareholders may differ from the interests of other shareholders with respect
to the issuance of shares
 business transactions with or sales to other companies
 selection of other directors and other business
decisions. The minority shareholders have no way of overriding decisions made by our principal shareholders. This level of control
may also have an adverse impact on the market value of our shares because our principal shareholders may institute or undertake
transactions
 policies or programs that result in losses
 may not take any steps to increase our visibility in the financial community
and / or may sell sufficient numbers of shares to significantly decrease our price per share.

We
do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future

We
have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock at any time in
the foreseeable future. The future payment of dividends directly depends upon our future earnings
 capital requirements
 financial
requirements and other factors that our board of directors will consider. Since we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on
our common stock
 return on your investment
 if any
 will depend solely on an increase
 if any
 in the market value of our common
stock.

The
&ldquo;market overhang&rdquo; from our outstanding options
 warrants and convertible securities could adversely impact the market
price of our common stock

As
of the date of this Report
 we have 4
808
347 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants
&rdquo; could adversely impact the market
price of our common stock as a result of the dilution which would result if such securities were exercised for or converted into
shares of common stock.

 we were served with a summons and complaint with respect to a breach of contract action filed in Superior Court
of the State of California
 Los Angeles County
 by Statewide Beverage Company
 Inc. (&ldquo;Statewide&rdquo;)
 a former distributor
of the Company&rsquo;s products
 whose distribution agreement
 with the Company had terminated effective November 2016 for &ldquo;cause&rdquo;
(non-payment of invoices within the applicable grace period provided in the distribution agreement). The complaint alleged that
the distribution agreement was terminated without &ldquo;cause&rdquo; and sought unspecified damages consisting of termination
payments and fees which would be due upon a termination without &ldquo;cause
&rdquo; but not on a termination for &ldquo;cause&rdquo;
as well as certain invasion fees allegedly due under the terms of the distribution agreement. The Company settled this case as
of July 31
 2018 for three cash payments over a five (5) month period through January 1
 2019 totaling $750
000 and the issuance
of 60

Results
of Operations

Year
ended December 31
 2018 compared to year ended December 31
 2017



For
the year ended December 31
 2018
 revenue was approximately $52.6 million
 an increase of $16.4 million or 45% from $36.2 million
for the year ended December 31
 2017. This revenue growth was mainly associated with the results of the North American region
which delivered an increase of $14.8 million over last year or 62% increase. The Asia region contributed growth of $3.5 million
in revenues when compared to 2017. Our revenue performance was partially offset by a contraction in our European revenue of $1.8
million due to normalization of inventory levels
 changes in flavors as well as the impact of restructuring changes in our Nordics
distributor. The overall increase in revenue from 2017 to 2018 was primarily attributable to an increase in sales volume
 as opposed
to increases in product pricing.


    
    



The
following table sets forth the amount of revenues by category and changes therein for the years ended December 31
 2018 and December

Gross
profit

For
the year ended December 31
 2018
 gross profit increased by approximately $5.6 million or 36% to $21.0 million from $15.4 million
for the year ended December 31
 2017. Gross profit margins totaled 40% and 43% in the years ended December 31
 2018 and December
31
 2017
 respectively. The reduction in gross margin profitability is mainly related to increases in promotional allowances
product repackaging and increase in freight costs. The increase in gross profit dollars from 2017 to 2018 is primarily attributable
to the increases in revenue.

Sales
and marketing expenses

Sales
and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31
 2018
 were approximately $21.2 million
 an increase of $4.6 million
 or
28% from $16.6 million for the year ended December 31
 2017. The increase is due primarily to incremental in investments in sales
and marketing programs which totaled $14.6 million in 2018
 with focus on expansion and the launch of products into China and
Hong Kong which accounted for approximately $7.1 million. The increase in sales and marketing expenses from 2017 to 2018 also
reflected increased warehouse costs of $394
000
 broker costs of $422
000 and increases in human resource investments of $1.1
million respectively. As a result of the royalty license and repayment of investment agreement entered into effective January
1
 2019 with Qifeng
 our distribution partner in China.
 we anticipate that selling in marketing expenses in China will decrease
in subsequent periods.

General
and administrative expenses

General
and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31
 2018 were approximately $10.5 million
 an increase of $3.6 million
or 52%
 from $6.9 million for the year ended December 31
 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation
of $2.1 million and other general administration expenses of $1.5 million
 mainly related the settlement of a lawsuit with a former
distributor of approximately $1.0 million.

Other
expense

Total
other expense increased by approximately $405
000 for year ended December 31
 2018 to $566
000 from $161
000 for the year ended
December 31
 2017
 mainly related to the recognition of a loss on debt extinguishment of $377
000 and amortization of discounts
on notes payable of $28
000.

Net
Loss

As
a result of all the above
 for the year ended December 31
 2018
 Celsius had a net loss of $11.2 million and after giving effect
to preferred stock dividends of $213
133
 a net loss of $11.4 million or $0.23 per share based on a weighted average of 50
050
696
shares outstanding. In comparison
 for the year ended December 31
 2017 we had a net loss of $8.2 million
 and after giving effect
to preferred stock dividends of $366
000
 a net loss of $8.6 million or $0.19 per share based on a weighted average of 44
419
162
shares outstanding. A significant portion of the increase in net loss was attributable to increased expenses incurred in connection
with entering and commencing distribution of our products in the Asian market and stock-based compensation expense.


    
    



Liquidity
and Capital Resources

As
of December 31
 2018
 and December 31
 2017
 we had cash of approximately $7.7 million and $14.2 million
 respectively and working
capital of approximately $20.2 million and $20.6 million
 respectively. Cash used in operations during the years ended December
31
 2018 and 2017
 totaled approximately $12.1 million and $8.4 million
 respectively
 reflecting increases in inventories on

Controls
    and Procedures.


Disclosure
controls and procedures

Our
President and Chief Executive Officer as well as our Chief Financial Officer
 conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act
 as of December 31
 2018
 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us
under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the rules and forms
adopted by the SEC
 including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our President and Chief Executive Officer
(our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial and accounting officer)
 or persons
performing similar functions
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Based on that evaluation
our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 31
 2018
 our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective in that (a) we maintain records that in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (b) our records provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that
our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and board of directors;
and (c) our records provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or
disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Our
President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls
will prevent all error and all fraud. Although our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance
of achieving their objectives and our principal executive officer and our Chief Financial Officer have determined that our disclosure
controls and procedures are effective at doing so
 a control system
 no matter how well conceived and operated
 can provide only
reasonable
 not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further
 the design of a control system must reflect
the fact that there are resource constraints
 and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud
 if any
 within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
that judgments in decision-making can be faulty
 and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally
controls can be circumvented if there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

Management&rsquo;s
report on internal control over financial reporting



for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act. Our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
 conducted an evaluation of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2018
 based on the framework set forth in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013). Internal control
over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by
or under the supervision of
 the Company&rsquo;s principal executive and financial officers and effected by the Company&rsquo;s
board of directors
 management and other personnel
 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
and includes those policies and procedures that:



    
    
Pertain
    to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
    the assets of the Company&#894;




    
    
Provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
    with authorizations of management and directors of the Company&#894; and



Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of the Company&rsquo;s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



    
    


Based
on the evaluation conducted under the above-referenced framework
 our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer concluded that as of December 31
 2018
 our internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Because
of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Item 308 (b) of Regulation
S-K.

Changes
in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting

There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of the year ended December
31
 2018
 that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Celsius Holdings
 Inc.

Opinions
on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Celsius Holdings
 Inc. (the Company) as of December 31
 2018 and
2017
 and the related consolidated statements of operations
 comprehensive income
 stockholders&rsquo; equity
 and cash flows
for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31
 2018
 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated
financial statements). We also have audited the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2018
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In
our opinion
 the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position
of the Company as of December 31
 2018 and 2017 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in
the two-year period ended December 31
 2018
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also
 in our opinion
 the Company maintained
 in all material respects
 effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31
 2018
 based on criteria established in 
issued by COSO.

Basis
for Opinion

The
Company&rsquo;s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements
 for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting
 and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in
the accompanying Management&rsquo;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether
due to error or fraud
 and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our
audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of
the consolidated financial statements
 whether due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our
audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
 assessing the risk that a material weakness exists
 and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinions.

Definition
and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A
company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
 or disposition of the company&rsquo;s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Concentrations
of Risk

The
Company uses single supplier relationships for its raw materials purchases and filling capacity
 which potentially subjects the
Company to a concentration of business risk. If these suppliers had operational problems or ceased making product available to
the Company
 operations could be adversely affected.

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents
and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high-quality financial institutions. At times
balances in the Company&rsquo;s cash accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit. At December 31
 2018
the Company had approximately $6.76 million in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit.

For
the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 the Company had the following 10 percent or greater concentrations of revenue with
its customers:

Inventories

using the FIFO method. Inventories consist of raw materials and finished products. The Company establishes an inventory reserve
to reduce the value of the inventory during the period in which such materials and products are no longer usable or marketable.
Specifically
 the Company reviews inventory utilization during the past twelve months and also customer orders for subsequent
months. If there has been no utilization during the last 12 months and there are no orders in-place in future months which will
require the use of inventory item
 then inventory item will be included as part of the reserve during the period being evaluated.
Management will then specifically evaluate whether these items may be utilized within a reasonable time frame (e.g.
 3 to 6 months).
In 2018 and 2017
 the Company recorded inventory reserves in the amount of $74
650 and $36
300
 respectively. The inventory reserve
is included in cost of revenue. Free Samples are recorded as cost of sales.

Property
and Equipment
of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset generally ranging
from three to seven years.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets
 &ldquo;Property
 Plant
 and Equipment&rdquo; the Company reviews
the carrying value of intangibles and other long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured
by comparison of its carrying amount to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If
such assets are considered to be impaired
 the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount
of the property
 if any
 exceeds its fair value.

Revenue
Recognition
 2018
 the Company adopted Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (&ldquo;ASC
606&rdquo;). The new guidance sets forth a new five-step revenue recognition model which replaces the prior revenue recognition
guidance in its entirety and is intended to eliminate numerous industry-specific pieces of revenue recognition guidance that have
historically existed in U.S. GAAP. The underlying principle of the new standard is that a business or other organization will
recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects
to receive in exchange for the goods or services. The standard also requires more detailed disclosures and provides additional
guidance for transactions that were not addressed completely in the prior accounting guidance. The Company adopted the standard
using the modified retrospective method and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

The
Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Product
sales occur once control is transferred upon delivery to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the
Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods. The amount of consideration the Company receives and revenue the
Company recognizes varies with changes in customer incentives the Company offers to its customers and their customers. Sales taxes
and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue.

Customer
Advance 
Such amounts are initially recorded as customer advances liability. The Company recognizes such revenue as it is earned in accordance
with revenue recognition policies.

Advertising
Costs
 local sampling events
 sponsorships
endorsements
 and digital advertising. The Company incurred advertising expense of approximately $13.8 million and $6.8 million
during year ending December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.

Research
and Development
consist primarily of consulting fees
 raw material usage and test productions of beverages. The Company incurred expenses of $572
000
and $360
000 during year ending December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.

Foreign
Currency Translation &mdash; 
 foreign subsidiaries&rsquo; functional currency is the local currency of operations
and the net assets of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. The U.S. dollar results
that arise from such translation
 as well as exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances of long-term investment nature
are included in Comprehensive Income. The Company incurred foreign currency translation gains during the year ending in December
31
 2018 of approximately $12
400 and a loss of approximately $39
978 during the twelve months ending December 31
 2017.

Observable inputs

and December 31
 2017.

Income
Taxes &mdash; 
 &ldquo;Accounting for Income
Taxes
&rdquo; which requires
 among other things
 an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset
and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences
of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided
to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will
not be realized. The Company follows the provisions of the ASC 740 -10 related to


 it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing
authorities
 while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that
would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10
 the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the
financial statements in the period during which
 based on all available evidence
 management believes it is more likely than not
that the position will be sustained upon examination
 including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes
 if any.

Income
Taxes (continued) &mdash;
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely
of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions
taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the
accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon
examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such
 the Company
has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits.

The


a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a
tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished.
For tax positions considered effectively settled
 an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit
 even if the tax position
is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations
remains open.

The
Company&rsquo;s tax returns for tax years in 2015 through 2018 remain subject to potential examination by the taxing authorities.

Earnings
per Share 
number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number
of common and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the period. Dilutive common share equivalents consist of shares
issuable upon conversion of convertible debt
 exercise of stock options and warrants (calculated using the reverse treasury stock
method). As of December 31
 2018
 the convertible debt may be converted into additional shares of common stock amounting to 2

There
were no other dilutive common shares equivalents
 including convertible notes and warrants

Leases
 We have completed our initial assessment of the requirements of ASU No. 2016-02. We plan to adopt ASU No. 2016-02
as amended
 effective January 1
 2019. The adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of right to use assets and
lease liabilities that have not been previously recorded. Based on our initial assessment
 we do not expect that the adoption
of the ASU will have a material impact to our financial statements and disclosures. The company is continuing to monitor potential
changes that have been proposed by the FASB and will assess any necessary changes to the implementation process as the guidance
is actualized.

In
August 2017
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-15
 Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2017-15 clarifies
the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective
for public business entities for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those years
 beginning after December 15
 2018. Early
adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2017-15 on its financial statements and
related disclosures.

In
October 2017
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-16&mdash;Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.
This ASU improves the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This
ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this ASU to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial
statements.

In
November 2017
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-18 (ASU 2017-18)
 Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash. This
ASU provides guidance on the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU are
effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in the
ASU should be adopted on a retrospective basis. The Company does not expect that adoption of this ASU to have a material effect
on its consolidated financial statements.


    
    



In

guidance on the types of changes to the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards an entity is required to apply modification
accounting under ASC 718. The amendments in this ASU are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15
2018. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material effect on our consolidated financial
statements.

In
June 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13
 Financial Instruments &ndash; Credit Losses (Topic 326) (&ldquo;ASU 2016-13&rdquo;)
which requires the immediate recognition of management&rsquo;s estimates of current and expected credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is
effective for fiscal years and interim reporting periods within those years beginning after December 15
 2019. Early adoption
is permitted after fiscal years beginning December 15
 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting
this guidance on our financial statements.

In
August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13
 Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework

Changes
to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The amendments in this update modify the disclosure requirements on
fair value measurements in Topic 820. The ASU is effective for the Registrants for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this standard on their
Financial Statements.

In
July 2018
 FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-11; Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity
(Topic 480): Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features
(Part II) Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Non public Entities
and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Non controlling Interests with a Scope Exception. The guidance is intended to reduce the complexity
associated with issuers&rsquo; accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. Specifically
a down round feature (as defined) would no longer cause a freestanding equity-linked financial instrument (or an embedded conversion
option) to be accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in current earnings.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted.
We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

    for the line of credit. The note matures in January 2020

The
Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with CDS Ventures of South Florida
 LLC (&ldquo;CDS&rdquo;) and CD Financial
LLC (&ldquo;CD&rdquo;). CDS and CD are limited liability companies which are affiliates of Carl DeSantis
 the Company&rsquo;s
principal shareholder. The Company issued 2
200 shares of its Series C Preferred Stock (the &ldquo;Preferred C Shares&rdquo;)
in exchange for the conversion of a $550
000 short term loan from CDS and the conversion of $1
650
000 in indebtedness under the
Company&rsquo;s line of credit with CD (the &ldquo;CD Line of Credit&rdquo;). The Preferred C Shares are convertible into our
common stock at the option of the holder thereof at a conversion price of $0.52 per share at any time until December 31
 2018
at which time they will automatically convert into shares of our common stock determined by dividing the liquidation preference
of $1
000 per Preferred C Share by the conversion price then in effect. The conversion price is subject to adjustment in the event
of stock dividends
 stock splits and similar events. The Preferred C Shares accrue cumulative annual dividends at the rate of
6% per annum
 payable by the issuance of additional Preferred C Shares. The holder of Preferred C Shares votes on an &ldquo;as
converted&rdquo; basis
 together with holders of common stock as a single class on all matters presented to shareholders for a
vote
 except as required by law. In April 2015
 the Company issued 180 Preferred C Shares valued at $180
000 in settlement of
$180
000 in accrued preferred C dividends. In October 2017
 the Company issued 383 Preferred C Shares valued at $383
000 in settlement
of $383
000 in accrued preferred C dividends. As of December 31
 2018
 $255
903 of dividends has been accrued and converted into
256 of additional Preferred C. The Preferred C Shares matured on December 31
 2018 and were exchanged for shares of Company common
stock in the amount of 5
806
022.

On
April 16
 2015
 the Company entered into an amendment to its existing Loan and Security Agreement (the &ldquo;Amendment&rdquo;)
with CD an affiliate of CDS Ventures and Mr. DeSantis. Pursuant to the Amendment
 the outstanding principal amount of the CD note
payable was reduced by $4.0 million
 which amount was converted into 4
000 shares of a newly-designated Series D Preferred Stock
(the &ldquo;Preferred D Shares&rdquo;). This related party was given a conversion price of $0.86 per common share
 whereas other
investors purchased common shares at $0.89 in the private placement
 as discussed in note 12. The difference of $0.03 per share
which resulted in $139
535
 was recorded as a dividend in accordance with ASC 470-20-35
 subsequent measurement for debt with
conversion and other options. The Preferred D Shares are convertible into our common stock at the option of the holder thereof
at a conversion price of $0.86 per share until the earlier of the January 2
 2021 due date of our note payable with CD Financial
or such earlier date as the note payable is satisfied (the &ldquo;Maturity Date&rdquo;). The conversion price is subject to adjustment
in the event of stock dividends
 stock splits and similar events. The Preferred D Shares accrue cumulative annual cash dividends
at the rate of 5% per annum
 payable quarterly in cash and have a liquidation preference of $1
000 per share. On the Maturity
Date
 the Preferred D Shares automatically convert into shares of our common stock in a number determined by dividing the $1
000
per Preferred D Share liquidation preference plus any accrued but unpaid dividends
 by the conversion price then in effect. The
Holder shall have the right
 at its election
 to require the Company to redeem all or any portion of the shares held by the holder
in exchange for cash or common stock upon the occurrence of certain events which management believes are under the control of
the Company. As of March 31
 2018
 none of the contingent events have occurred and in accordance with ASC-480-10-25 &ldquo;Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity&rdquo; and Regulation S-X-Rule 5-02-27
 the Company has classified these shares as permanent equity. The
Preferred D Shares may also be redeemed by us at any time on or after December 31
 2017
 at a redemption price equal to 104% of
the liquidation preference. The holder of the Preferred D Shares votes on an &ldquo;as converted&rdquo; basis
 together with holders
of common stock as a single class on all matters presented to shareholders for a vote
 except as required by law. In March 2018
the Preferred D shares were converted into 4
651
163 shares of common stock.

loss carry forwards at December 31
 2018 were approximately $47.7 million

 will expire through
2037 and $1.7 million attributable to the current year may be carried forward indefinitely. China has corporate tax rate of 25%
with net operating loss carry forwards expiring after 5 years. The Company had $11.2 million of net operating loss carry forwards
in China as of December 31

expire. The Company had $1.87million of net operating loss carry forwards in Hong Kong as of December 31
 2018. The Company&rsquo;s

December 22
 2018 a new tax bill was signed into law that reduced the federal income tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21%.
The new bill reduced the blended tax rate for the Company from 38.5% to 25.35%. The change in blended tax rate reduced the 2017
US net operating loss carry forward deferred tax assets by approximately $5.5 million.



    
    


The
Company adopted an Incentive Stock Plan on January 18
 2007. This plan is intended to provide incentives which will attract
and retain highly competent persons at all levels as employees of the Company
 as well as independent contractors providing
consulting or advisory services to the Company
 by providing them opportunities to acquire the Company&rsquo;s common stock
or to receive monetary payments based on the value of such shares pursuant to Awards issued. While the plan terminates 10
years after the adoption date
 issued options have their own schedule of termination. During 2013
 the majority of the
shareholders approved to increase the total available shares in the plan from 2.5 million to 3.5 million shares of common
stock. During May 2014
 the majority of the shareholders approved to increase the total available shares in the plan from 3.5
million to 4.25 million shares of common stock
 during February 2015
 the majority of the shareholders approved to increase
the total available shares in the plan from 4.25 million to 4.6 million shares of common stock and during April 2015
 the
majority of the shareholders approved to increase the total available shares in the plan from 4.6 million to 5.1 million
shares of common stock. Until 2018
 options to acquire shares of common stock may be granted at no less than fair market
value on the date of grant. Upon exercise
 shares of new common stock are issued by the Company.

The
Company adopted the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan on April 30
 2015. This plan is intended to provide incentives which will attract
and retain highly competent persons at all levels as employees of the Company
 as well as independent contractors providing consulting
or advisory services to the Company
 by providing them opportunities to acquire the Company&rsquo;s common stock or to receive
monetary payments based on the value of such shares pursuant to Awards issued. The 2015 Plan permits the grant of options and
shares for up to 5
000
000 shares. In addition
 there is a provision for an annual increase of 15% to the shares included under
the plan
 with the shares to be added on the first day of each calendar year
 beginning on January 1
 2017.

Under
the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan
 the Company has issued options to purchase approximately 4.47 million shares at an average price
of $3.80 with a fair value of $5.34 million. For the year ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 the Company issued options to purchase
1.83 million and 1.2 million shares. For the year ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 the Company recognized an expense of approximately
$4.3 million and $2.2 million
 respectively
 of non-cash compensation expense (included in General and Administrative expense
in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations) determined by application of a Black Scholes option pricing model with
the following inputs: exercise price
 dividend yields
 risk-free interest rate
 and expected annual volatility. As of December
31
 2018
 the Company had approximately $7
334
000 of unrecognized pre-tax non-cash compensation expense
 which the Company expects
to recognize
 based on a weighted-average period of 3 years. The Company used straight-line amortization of compensation expense
over the two to three-year requisite service or vesting period of the grant. There are options to purchase approximately 3.06
million shares that have vested as of December 31
 2018.

The
Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of its stock option awards and warrant issuances.
The calculation of the fair value of the awards using the Black - Scholes option-pricing model is affected by the Company&rsquo;s
stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following:

The
expected volatility was determined with reference to the historical volatility of the Company&rsquo;s stock. The Company uses
historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model. The expected term of options
granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate for periods
within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the time of grant.

A
summary of the status of the Company&rsquo;s outstanding stock options as of December 31
 2018 and 2017 and changes during the
period ending on that date is as follows:

Celsius
Holdings
 Inc.
Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements
December
31
 2018



    
    


On
February 22
 2017
 we were served with a summons and complaint with respect to a breach of contract action filed in Superior Court
of the State of California
 Los Angeles County
 by Statewide Beverage Company
 Inc. (&ldquo;Statewide&rdquo;)
 a former distributor
of the Company&rsquo;s products
 whose distribution agreement
 with the Company had terminated effective November 2016 for &ldquo;cause&rdquo;
(non-payment of invoices within the applicable grace period provided in the distribution agreement). The complaint alleged that
the distribution agreement was terminated without &ldquo;cause&rdquo; and sought unspecified damages consisting of termination
payments and fees which would be due upon a termination without &ldquo;cause
&rdquo; but not on a termination for &ldquo;cause&rdquo;
as well as certain invasion fees allegedly due under the terms of the distribution agreement. The Company settled this case as
of July 19
 2018 for three cash payments over a five (5) month period through January 1
 2019 totaling $750
000 and the issuance
of 60
000 restricted shares of our common stock
 valued at $4.66 per share. Accordingly
 the total impact of this settlement amounted
to $1
029
600.

In
addition to the foregoing
 from time to time
 we may become party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to
be a part of the ordinary course of our business.

The
Company has entered into distribution agreements with liquidated damages in case the Company cancels the distribution agreements
without cause. Cause has been defined in various ways. It is management&rsquo;s belief that no such agreement has created any
liability as of December 31
 2018.

The
Company entered into an office lease with a related party (see note 11) effective October 2015. The monthly rent amounts to $12
452
per month until October 2019 and then increases to $12
826 per month until the termination of the lease in October 2020. Future
annual minimum payments required under operating lease obligations at December 31
 2018 are as follows:

In
January 2019
 the Company entered into a license and repayment of investment agreement with Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co.
Ltd (&ldquo;Qifeng&rdquo;). Under the agreement
 Qifeng was granted the exclusive license rights to manufacture
 market and commercialize
Celsius branded products in China. Qifeng agreed to provide a return of a fixed $6.9 million as a license fee covering the first
five years
 then transitioning to a volume-based royalty fee. In addition
 Qifeng will repay the capital Celsius has invested
into the China market to date
 over a five-year term.

Between
January 1
 2018 and March 8
 2018
 the Company issued an aggregate of 195
857 shares of its common stock pursuant to the exercise
of stock options granted under the Company&rsquo;s 2015 Stock Incentive Plan. The Company cash in the amount of $24
760 for options
exercised.

 the Company entered into a line of credit note payable with a related party and major shareholder which carries interest of five percent per annum paid quarterly. The Company can borrow up to $9
500
000. The Company has pledged all its assets as security for the line of credit. The note matures in January 2020
 at which time the principal amount is due. During April 2015
 the Company issued $4
000
000 of convertible series D preferred series in exchange for cancellation of $4
000
000 of this line
 reducing the amount to $4
500

 the Company issued $1
000
000 of common stock in exchange for cancellation of $1
000
000 of this line
 reducing the amount to $3
500
000. In December 2018
 the company amended and restated the note payable into a convertible loan agreement continuing to carry a five percent per annum interest but payable semi-annually. As a result
 of this substantial modification which was treated as a debt extinguishment
 a new liability was established and a loss of $377
0418 on the extinguishment of debt was recognized. The Company can now borrow up to $5.0 million. The note matures in December 2020. The balance at December 31

 LLC (&amp;#8220;CDS&amp;#8221;) and CD Financial
 LLC (&amp;#8220;CD&amp;#8221;). CDS and&#13;CD are limited liability companies which are affiliates of Carl DeSantis
 the Company&amp;#8217;s principal shareholder. The Company&#13;issued 2
200 shares of its Series C Preferred Stock (the &amp;#8220;Preferred C Shares&amp;#8221;) in exchange for the conversion of a&#13;$550
000 short term loan from CDS and the conversion of $1
650
000 in indebtedness under the Company&amp;#8217;s line of credit with&#13;CD (the &amp;#8220;CD Line of Credit&amp;#8221;). The Preferred C Shares are convertible into our common stock at the option of the holder&#13;thereof at a conversion price of $0.52 per share at any time until December 31
 2018
 at which time they will automatically convert&#13;into shares of our common stock determined by dividing the liquidation preference of $1
000 per Preferred C Share by the conversion&#13;price then in effect. The conversion price is subject to adjustment in the event of stock dividends
 stock splits and similar events.&#13;The Preferred C Shares accrue cumulative annual dividends at the rate of 6% per annum
 payable by the issuance of additional Preferred&#13;C Shares. The holder of Preferred C Shares votes on an &amp;#8220;as converted&amp;#8221; basis
 together with holders of common stock&#13;as a single class on all matters presented to shareholders for a vote
 except as required by law. In April 2015
 the Company issued&#13;180 Preferred C Shares valued at $180
000 in settlement of $180
000 in accrued preferred C dividends. In October 2017
 the Company&#13;issued 383 Preferred C Shares valued at $383
000 in settlement of $383
000 in accrued preferred C dividends. As of December 31
&#13;2018
 $255
903 of dividends has been accrued and converted into 256 of additional Preferred C. The Preferred C Shares matured on&#13;December 31
 2018 and were exchanged for shares of Company common stock in the amount of 5

 2015
 the Company entered&#13;into an amendment to its existing Loan and Security Agreement (the &amp;#8220;Amendment&amp;#8221;) with CD an affiliate of CDS Ventures&#13;and Mr. DeSantis. Pursuant to the Amendment
 the outstanding principal amount of the CD note payable was reduced by $4.0 million
&#13;which amount was converted into 4
000 shares of a newly-designated Series D Preferred Stock (the &amp;#8220;Preferred D Shares&amp;#8221;).&#13;This related party was given a conversion price of $0.86 per common share
 whereas other investors purchased common shares at $0.89&#13;in the private placement
 as discussed in note 12. The difference of $0.03 per share
 which resulted in $139
535
 was recorded&#13;as a dividend in accordance with ASC 470-20-35
 subsequent measurement for debt with conversion and other options. The Preferred&#13;D Shares are convertible into our common stock at the option of the holder thereof at a conversion price of $0.86 per share until&#13;the earlier of the January 2
 2021 due date of our note payable with CD Financial or such earlier date as the note payable is satisfied&#13;(the &amp;#8220;Maturity Date&amp;#8221;). The conversion price is subject to adjustment in the event of stock dividends
 stock splits&#13;and similar events. The Preferred D Shares accrue cumulative annual cash dividends at the rate of 5% per annum
 payable quarterly&#13;in cash and have a liquidation preference of $1
000 per share. On the Maturity Date
 the Preferred D Shares automatically convert&#13;into shares of our common stock in a number determined by dividing the $1
000 per Preferred D Share liquidation preference plus&#13;any accrued but unpaid dividends
 by the conversion price then in effect. The Holder shall have the right
 at its election
 to&#13;require the Company to redeem all or any portion of the shares held by the holder in exchange for cash or common stock upon the&#13;occurrence of certain events which management believes are under the control of the Company. As of March 31
 2018
 none of the&#13;contingent events have occurred and in accordance with ASC-480-10-25 &amp;#8220;Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity&amp;#8221; and Regulation&#13;S-X-Rule 5-02-27
 the Company has classified these shares as permanent equity. The Preferred D Shares may also be redeemed by us&#13;at any time on or after December 31
 2017
 at a redemption price equal to 104% of the liquidation preference. The holder of the&#13;Preferred D Shares votes on an &amp;#8220;as converted&amp;#8221; basis
 together with holders of common stock as a single class on all&#13;matters presented to shareholders for a vote
 except as required by law. In March 2018
 the Preferred D shares were converted into&#13;4

 2017
 we were served&#13;with a summons and complaint with respect to a breach of contract action filed in Superior Court of the State of California
 Los&#13;Angeles County
 by Statewide Beverage Company
 Inc. (&amp;#8220;Statewide&amp;#8221;)
 a former distributor of the Company&amp;#8217;s products
&#13;whose distribution agreement
 with the Company had terminated effective November 2016 for &amp;#8220;cause&amp;#8221; (non-payment of invoices&#13;within the applicable grace period provided in the distribution agreement). The complaint alleged that the distribution agreement&#13;was terminated without &amp;#8220;cause&amp;#8221; and sought unspecified damages consisting of termination payments and fees which would&#13;be due upon a termination without &amp;#8220;cause
&amp;#8221; but not on a termination for &amp;#8220;cause&amp;#8221; as well as certain invasion&#13;fees allegedly due under the terms of the distribution agreement. The Company settled this case as of July 19
 2018 for three cash&#13;payments over a five (5) month period through January 1
 2019 totaling $750
000 and the issuance of 60
000 restricted shares of&#13;our common stock
 valued at $4.66 per share. Accordingly
 the total impact of this settlement amounted to $1
029

 from&#13;time to time


452 per month until October 2019&#13;and then increases to $12
826 per month until the termination of the lease in October 2020. Future annual minimum payments required&#13;under operating lease obligations at December 31

 then inventory item will be included as part of the reserve during the period being evaluated. Management will&#13;then specifically evaluate whether these items may be utilized within a reasonable time frame (e.g.

 &amp;#8220;Accounting for Income Taxes
&amp;#8221; which requires
&#13;among other things
 an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires&#13;the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between&#13;the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred&#13;tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized. The Company&#13;follows the provisions of the ASC 740 -10 related to
 &lt;i&gt;Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions. &lt;/i&gt;When tax returns are&#13;filed
 it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities
 while others&#13;are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.&#13;In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10
 the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the&#13;period during which
 based on all available evidence
 management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be&#13;sustained upon examination
 including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes


&lt;/i&gt; which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively&#13;settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively&#13;settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered&#13;effectively settled
 an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit

The guidance is intended to reduce the complexity associated with issuers&amp;#8217;&#13;accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. Specifically
 a down round feature&#13;(as defined) would no longer cause a freestanding equity-linked financial instrument (or an embedded conversion option) to be accounted&#13;for as a derivative liability at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in current earnings. The amendments in this ASU&#13;are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15

 then inventory item will be included as part of the reserve during the period being evaluated. Management will&#13;then specifically evaluate whether these items may be utilized within a reasonable time frame (e.g.

 &amp;#8220;Accounting for Income Taxes
&amp;#8221; which requires
&#13;among other things
 an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires&#13;the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between&#13;the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred&#13;tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized. The Company&#13;follows the provisions of the ASC 740 -10 related to
 &lt;i&gt;Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions. &lt;/i&gt;When tax returns are&#13;filed
 it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities
 while others&#13;are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.&#13;In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10
 the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period&#13;during which
 based on all available evidence
 management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained&#13;upon examination
 including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes


&lt;/i&gt; which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively&#13;settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively&#13;settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered&#13;effectively settled
 an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit

Sum of the carrying values as of the balance sheet date of obligations incurred through that date and due within one year (or the operating cycle
 if longer)
 including liabilities incurred (and for which invoices have typically been received) and payable to vendors for goods and services received
 taxes
 interest
 rent and utilities
 accrued salaries and bonuses
 payroll taxes and fringe benefits.
 -Subparagraph (SX 210.5-02.19
20)



























Amount due from customers or clients
 within one year of the balance sheet date (or the normal operating cycle
 whichever is longer)
 for goods or services (including trade receivables) that have been delivered or sold in the normal course of business
 reduced to the estimated net realizable fair value by an allowance established by the entity of the amount it deems uncertain of collection.




























Accumulated change in equity from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources
 net of tax effect
 at period end. Excludes Net Income (Loss)
 and accumulated changes in equity from transactions resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Includes foreign currency translation items
 certain pension adjustments
 unrealized gains and losses on certain investments in debt and equity securities
 other than temporary impairment (OTTI) losses related to factors other than credit losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities that an entity does not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell before recovery of the amortized cost basis
 as well as changes in the fair value of derivatives related to the effective portion of a designated cash flow hedge.




























Excess of issue price over par or stated value of the entity's capital stock and amounts received from other transactions involving the entity's stock or stockholders. Includes adjustments to additional paid in capital. Some examples of such adjustments include recording the issuance of debt with a beneficial conversion feature and certain tax consequences of equity instruments awarded to employees. Use this element for the aggregate amount of additional paid-in capital associated with common and preferred stock. For additional paid-in capital associated with only common stock
 use the element additional paid in capital
 common stock. For additional paid-in capital associated with only preferred stock
 use the element additional paid in capital
 preferred stock.

























































Sum of the carrying amounts as of the balance sheet date of all assets that are expected to be realized in cash
 sold
 or consumed within one year (or the normal operating cycle
 if longer). Assets are probable future economic benefits obtained or controlled by an entity as a result of past transactions or events.
























































Cash includes currency on hand as well as demand deposits with banks or financial institutions. It also includes other kinds of accounts that have the general characteristics of demand deposits in that the customer may deposit additional funds at any time and effectively may withdraw funds at any time without prior notice or penalty. Cash equivalents
 excluding items classified as marketable securities
 include short-term
 highly liquid Investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash
 and so near their maturity that they present minimal risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally
 only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example
 both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However
 a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months. Short-term investments
 exclusive of cash equivalents
 generally consist of marketable securities intended to be sold within one year (or the normal operating cycle if longer) and may include trading securities
 available-for-sale securities
 or held-to-maturity securities (if maturing within one year)
 as applicable.




























Aggregate par or stated value of issued nonredeemable common stock (or common stock redeemable solely at the option of the issuer). This item includes treasury stock repurchased by the entity. Note: elements for number of nonredeemable common shares
 par value and other disclosure concepts are in another section within stockholders' equity.




























Carrying value as of the balance sheet date of long-term debt (with maturities initially due after one year or beyond the operating cycle if longer) identified as Convertible Notes Payable
 excluding current portion. Convertible Notes Payable is a written promise to pay a note which can be exchanged for a specified amount of another
 related security
 at the option of the issuer and the holder.

























































Amount after valuation and LIFO reserves of inventory expected to be sold
 or consumed within one year or operating cycle
 if longer.

























































Amount of liabilities and equity items
 including the portion of equity attributable to noncontrolling interests
 if any.




























Total obligations incurred as part of normal operations that are expected to be paid during the following twelve months or within one business cycle
 if longer.




















































































The amount for notes payable (written promise to pay)
 payable to related parties
 which are due after one year (or one business cycle).




























Amount of liabilities classified as other
 due within one year or the normal operating cycle
 if longer.




























Aggregate par or stated value of issued nonredeemable preferred stock (or preferred stock redeemable solely at the option of the issuer). This item includes treasury stock repurchased by the entity. Note: elements for number of nonredeemable preferred shares
 par value and other disclosure concepts are in another section within stockholders' equity.




























Amount of asset related to consideration paid in advance for costs that provide economic benefits in future periods
 and amount of other assets.




























Amount after accumulated depreciation
 depletion and amortization of physical assets used in the normal conduct of business to produce goods and services and not intended for resale. Examples include
 but are not limited to
 land
 buildings
 machinery and equipment
 office equipment
 and furniture and fixtures.

























































Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items
 net of receivables from officers
 directors
 owners
 and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent. The amount of the economic entity's stockholders' equity attributable to the parent excludes the amount of stockholders' equity which is allocable to that ownership interest in subsidiary equity which is not attributable to the parent (noncontrolling interest
 minority interest). This excludes temporary equity and is sometimes called permanent equity.

have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;US GAAP&#8221;).

 &#8212;
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Celsius Holdings
 Inc. and its subsidiaries. All material
inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

 &#8212;
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
 liabilities
revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts
 reserves for inventory obsolescence
the useful lives and values of property
 fixtures and equipment
 valuation of stock based compensation
 and deferred tax asset
valuation allowance.

&#8212;
Although the Company has a number of operating divisions
 separate segment data has not been presented
 as they meet the criteria
for aggregation as permitted by ASC Topic 280
 Segment Reporting
 (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 131
 


is considered to be our Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The CEO reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis
for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. The financial information reviewed by the CEO is
identical to the information presented in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Therefore
 the Company has determined
that it operates in a single operating segment. For the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017 all material assets and revenues
of the Company were in the United States except as disclosed in Note 2.

 &#8212;
Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s revenue derives from the sale of Celsius &#174; beverages.


relationships for its raw materials purchases and filling capacity
 which potentially subjects the Company to a concentration of
business risk. If these suppliers had operational problems or ceased making product available to the Company
 operations could
be adversely affected.


subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The
Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high-quality financial institutions. At times
 balances in the Company&#8217;s
cash accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit. At December 31
 2018
 the Company had approximately $6.76
million in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit.


2018 and 2017
 the Company had the following 10 percent or greater concentrations of revenue with its customers:



    
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    



 2018 and 2017
 the
Company had the following 10 percent or greater concentrations of accounts receivable with its customers:



    
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    



from a customer located in Sweden. Revenues from all other customers were mainly derived from the United States. Receivables from
customer B are obtained from a customer located in China.

 &#8212;
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
At December 31
 2018 and December 31
 2017
 the Company did not have any investments with maturities of three months or less.

 &#8212;
Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon
factors pertaining to the credit risk of specific customers
 historical trends
 and other information. Delinquent accounts are
written-off when it is determined that the amounts are uncollectible. At December 31
 2018 and December 31
 2017
 there was an
allowance for doubtful accounts of $183
000 and $33
100
 respectively.

&#8212; Inventories
include only the purchase cost and are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the FIFO
method. Inventories consist of raw materials and finished products. The Company establishes an inventory reserve to reduce the
value of the inventory during the period in which such materials and products are no longer usable or marketable. Specifically
the Company reviews inventory utilization during the past twelve months and also customer orders for subsequent months. If there
has been no utilization during the last 12 months and there are no orders in-place in future months which will require the use
of inventory item
 then inventory item will be included as part of the reserve during the period being evaluated. Management will
then specifically evaluate whether these items may be utilized within a reasonable time frame (e.g.
 3 to 6 months). In 2018 and
2017
 the Company recorded inventory reserves in the amount of $74
650 and $36
300
 respectively. The inventory reserve is included
in cost of revenue. Free Samples are recorded as cost of sales.

 &#8212;
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of property and equipment
is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset generally ranging from three to seven
years.


&#8212; In accordance with ASC Topic 360
 &#8220;Property
 Plant
 and Equipment&#8221; the Company reviews the carrying value of
intangibles and other long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparison of its
carrying amount to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If such assets are considered
to be impaired
 the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property
 if any
exceeds its fair value.

 &#8212;
As of January 1
 2018
 the Company adopted Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (&#8220;ASC 606&#8221;). The new guidance
sets forth a new five-step revenue recognition model which replaces the prior revenue recognition guidance in its entirety and
is intended to eliminate numerous industry-specific pieces of revenue recognition guidance that have historically existed in U.S.
GAAP. The underlying principle of the new standard is that a business or other organization will recognize revenue to depict the
transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects to receive in exchange for the goods
or services. The standard also requires more detailed disclosures and provides additional guidance for transactions that were not
addressed completely in the prior accounting guidance. The Company adopted the standard using the modified retrospective method
and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.


performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Product sales occur once control is transferred
upon delivery to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for
transferring goods. The amount of consideration the Company receives and revenue the Company recognizes varies with changes in
customer incentives the Company offers to its customers and their customers. Sales taxes and other similar taxes are excluded from
revenue.

&#8212;
From time to time the Company requires deposits in advance of delivery of products and/or production runs. Such amounts are initially
recorded as customer advances liability. The Company recognizes such revenue as it is earned in accordance with revenue recognition
policies.

 &#8212;
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company uses mainly radio
 local sampling events
 sponsorships
 endorsements
 and
digital advertising. The Company incurred advertising expense of approximately $13.8 million and $6.8 million
 during year ending
December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.


&#8212; Research and development costs are charged to general and administrative expenses as incurred and consist primarily of
consulting fees
 raw material usage and test productions of beverages. The Company incurred expenses of $572
000 and $360
000 during
year ending December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.

Foreign Currency Translation
&#8212; 
 foreign subsidiaries&#8217; functional currency is the local currency of operations and the net assets of
foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. The U.S. dollar results that arise from such
translation
 as well as exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances of long-term investment nature
 are included in Comprehensive
Income. The Company incurred foreign currency translation gains during the year ending in December 31
 2018 of approximately $12
400
and a loss of approximately $39
978 during the twelve months ending December 31
 2017.


&#8212; The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable
 accrued expenses
 and notes payable
approximates fair value due to their relative short-term maturity and market interest rates.

 -
ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally
 ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:



    
    

    
    

    
    

    
    

    
Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data
 which require the use of the reporting entity&#8217;s own assumptions.



the Company did not have any other assets or liabilities measured at fair value at December 31
 2018 and December 31
 2017.

The
Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740-10
 &#8220;Accounting for Income Taxes
&#8221; which requires
among other things
 an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires
the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred
tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized. The Company
follows the provisions of the ASC 740 -10 related to
When tax returns are
filed
 it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities
 while others
are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10
 the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period
during which
 based on all available evidence
 management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained
upon examination
 including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes
 if any.

Tax
positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition
threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement
with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured
as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any
associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax
positions are all highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such
 the Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain
tax benefits.




settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively
settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered
effectively settled
 an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit
 even if the tax position is not considered more
likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open.


for tax years in 2015 through 2018 remain subject to potential examination by the taxing authorities.

&#8212;
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income (loss) available to stockholders by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common
and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the period. Dilutive common share equivalents consist of shares issuable
upon conversion of convertible debt
 exercise of stock options and warrants (calculated using the reverse treasury stock method).
As of December 31
 2018
 the convertible debt may be converted into additional shares of common stock amounting to 2
681
400.


shares equivalents
 including convertible notes and warrants
 as no common share equivalents had an exercise price below the ending
closing price of the year. The effects of dilutive instruments have not been presented as the effects would be anti-dilutive.

&#8212;The
Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 718 &#8220;Compensation &#8212; Stock Compensation&#8221; and related interpretations.
As such
 compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at the fair value of the share-based payments. Such compensation amounts
if any
 are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the grants. On April 30
 2015
 the Company adopted the 2015 Stock
Incentive Plan. This plan is intended to provide incentives which will attract and retain highly competent persons at all levels
as employees of the Company
 as well as independent contractors providing consulting or advisory services to the Company
 by providing
them opportunities to acquire the Company&#8217;s common stock or to receive monetary payments based on the value of such shares
pursuant to Awards issued. The 2015 Plan permits the grant of options and shares for up to 5
000
000 shares. In addition
 there
is a provision for an annual increase of 15% to the shares included under the plan
 with the shares to be added on the first day
of each calendar year
 beginning on January 1
 2017.

&#8212; Cost
of sales consists of the cost of concentrates and or beverage bases
 the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of
products
 co-packing fees
 repacking fees
 in-bound &#38; out-bound freight charges
 as well as certain internal transfer costs
warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the Company&#8217;s finished products and certain quality control costs.
Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans
 bottles
 other containers
 flavors
ingredients and packaging materials.

&#8212;
Operating expenses include selling expenses such as warehousing expenses after manufacture
 as well as expenses for advertising
samplings and in-store demonstrations costs
 costs for merchandise displays
 point-of-sale materials and premium items
 sponsorship
expenses
 other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs
 travel costs
professional service fees (including legal fees)
 depreciation and other general and administrative costs.

&#8212;
Shipping and handling costs for freight-out expense on goods shipped are included in cost of sales expenses in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income. Freight-out expense on goods shipped for year ended December 31
 2018 and 2017 was approximately
$5.5 million and $3.3 million
 respectively.

-In July 2010
 the Company entered into a line of credit note payable with a related party and major shareholder which carries interest of five percent per annum paid quarterly. The Company can borrow up to $9
500
000. The Company has pledged all its assets as security for the line of credit. The note matures in January 2020
 at which time the principal amount is due. During April 2015
 the Company issued $4
000
000 of convertible series D preferred series in exchange for cancellation of $4
000
000 of this line
 reducing the amount to $4
500
000. During March 2018
 the Company issued $1
000
000 of common stock in exchange for cancellation of $1
000
000 of this line
 reducing the amount to $3
500
000. In December 2018
 the company amended and restated the note payable into a convertible loan agreement continuing to carry a five percent per annum interest but payable semi-annually. As a result
 of this substantial modification which was treated as a debt extinguishment
 a new liability was established and a loss of $377
0418 on the extinguishment of debt was recognized. The Company can now borrow up to $5.0 million. The note matures in December 2020. The balance at December 31
 2018 is convertible into 1
032
162 shares at a fixed conversion price of $3.40 per share which was determined based on the average of the closing price for the shares during the ten (10) business days prior to the Advance Date

purchase agreement with CDS Ventures of South Florida
 LLC (&#8220;CDS&#8221;) and CD Financial
 LLC (&#8220;CD&#8221;). CDS and
CD are limited liability companies which are affiliates of Carl DeSantis
 the Company&#8217;s principal shareholder. The Company
issued 2
200 shares of its Series C Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Preferred C Shares&#8221;) in exchange for the conversion of a
$550
000 short term loan from CDS and the conversion of $1
650
000 in indebtedness under the Company&#8217;s line of credit with
CD (the &#8220;CD Line of Credit&#8221;). The Preferred C Shares are convertible into our common stock at the option of the holder
thereof at a conversion price of $0.52 per share at any time until December 31
 2018
 at which time they will automatically convert
into shares of our common stock determined by dividing the liquidation preference of $1
000 per Preferred C Share by the conversion
price then in effect. The conversion price is subject to adjustment in the event of stock dividends
 stock splits and similar events.
The Preferred C Shares accrue cumulative annual dividends at the rate of 6% per annum
 payable by the issuance of additional Preferred
C Shares. The holder of Preferred C Shares votes on an &#8220;as converted&#8221; basis
 together with holders of common stock
as a single class on all matters presented to shareholders for a vote
 except as required by law. In April 2015
 the Company issued
180 Preferred C Shares valued at $180
000 in settlement of $180
000 in accrued preferred C dividends. In October 2017
 the Company
issued 383 Preferred C Shares valued at $383
000 in settlement of $383
000 in accrued preferred C dividends. As of December 31
2018
 $255
903 of dividends has been accrued and converted into 256 of additional Preferred C. The Preferred C Shares matured on
December 31
 2018 and were exchanged for shares of Company common stock in the amount of 5
806
022.


 2015
 the Company entered
into an amendment to its existing Loan and Security Agreement (the &#8220;Amendment&#8221;) with CD an affiliate of CDS Ventures
and Mr. DeSantis. Pursuant to the Amendment
 the outstanding principal amount of the CD note payable was reduced by $4.0 million
which amount was converted into 4
000 shares of a newly-designated Series D Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Preferred D Shares&#8221;).
This related party was given a conversion price of $0.86 per common share
 whereas other investors purchased common shares at $0.89
in the private placement
 as discussed in note 12. The difference of $0.03 per share
 which resulted in $139
535
 was recorded
as a dividend in accordance with ASC 470-20-35
 subsequent measurement for debt with conversion and other options. The Preferred
D Shares are convertible into our common stock at the option of the holder thereof at a conversion price of $0.86 per share until
the earlier of the January 2
 2021 due date of our note payable with CD Financial or such earlier date as the note payable is satisfied
(the &#8220;Maturity Date&#8221;). The conversion price is subject to adjustment in the event of stock dividends
 stock splits
and similar events. The Preferred D Shares accrue cumulative annual cash dividends at the rate of 5% per annum
 payable quarterly
in cash and have a liquidation preference of $1
000 per share. On the Maturity Date
 the Preferred D Shares automatically convert
into shares of our common stock in a number determined by dividing the $1
000 per Preferred D Share liquidation preference plus
any accrued but unpaid dividends
 by the conversion price then in effect. The Holder shall have the right
 at its election
 to
require the Company to redeem all or any portion of the shares held by the holder in exchange for cash or common stock upon the
occurrence of certain events which management believes are under the control of the Company. As of March 31
 2018
 none of the
contingent events have occurred and in accordance with ASC-480-10-25 &#8220;Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity&#8221; and Regulation
S-X-Rule 5-02-27
 the Company has classified these shares as permanent equity. The Preferred D Shares may also be redeemed by us
at any time on or after December 31
 2017
 at a redemption price equal to 104% of the liquidation preference. The holder of the
Preferred D Shares votes on an &#8220;as converted&#8221; basis
 together with holders of common stock as a single class on all
matters presented to shareholders for a vote
 except as required by law. In March 2018
 the Preferred D shares were converted into
4
651
163 shares of common stock.

 2017
 we were served
with a summons and complaint with respect to a breach of contract action filed in Superior Court of the State of California
 Los
Angeles County
 by Statewide Beverage Company
 Inc. (&#8220;Statewide&#8221;)
 a former distributor of the Company&#8217;s products
whose distribution agreement
 with the Company had terminated effective November 2016 for &#8220;cause&#8221; (non-payment of invoices
within the applicable grace period provided in the distribution agreement). The complaint alleged that the distribution agreement
was terminated without &#8220;cause&#8221; and sought unspecified damages consisting of termination payments and fees which would
be due upon a termination without &#8220;cause
&#8221; but not on a termination for &#8220;cause&#8221; as well as certain invasion
fees allegedly due under the terms of the distribution agreement. The Company settled this case as of July 19
 2018 for three cash
payments over a five (5) month period through January 1
 2019 totaling $750
000 and the issuance of 60
000 restricted shares of

 &#8212;
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Celsius Holdings
 Inc. and its subsidiaries. All material
inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.




 &#8212;
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
 liabilities
revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts
 reserves for inventory obsolescence
the useful lives and values of property
 fixtures and equipment
 valuation of stock based compensation
 and deferred tax asset
valuation allowance.




&#8212;
Although the Company has a number of operating divisions
 separate segment data has not been presented
 as they meet the criteria
for aggregation as permitted by ASC Topic 280
 Segment Reporting
 (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 131
 


is considered to be our Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The CEO reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis
for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. The financial information reviewed by the CEO is
identical to the information presented in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Therefore
 the Company has determined
that it operates in a single operating segment. For the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017 all material assets and revenues
of the Company were in the United States except as disclosed in Note 2.




 &#8212;
Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s revenue derives from the sale of Celsius &#174; beverages.


relationships for its raw materials purchases and filling capacity
 which potentially subjects the Company to a concentration of
business risk. If these suppliers had operational problems or ceased making product available to the Company
 operations could
be adversely affected.


subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The
Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high-quality financial institutions. At times
 balances in the Company&#8217;s
cash accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit. At December 31
 2018
 the Company had approximately $6.76
million in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit.


2018 and 2017
 the Company had the following 10 percent or greater concentrations of revenue with its customers:



    
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    



 2018 and 2017

from a customer located in Sweden. Revenues from all other customers were mainly derived from the United States. Receivables from
customer B are obtained from a customer located in China.




 &#8212;
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
At December 31
 2018 and December 31
 2017
 the Company did not have any investments with maturities of three months or less.




 &#8212;
Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon
factors pertaining to the credit risk of specific customers
 historical trends
 and other information. Delinquent accounts are
written-off when it is determined that the amounts are uncollectible. At December 31
 2018 and December 31
 2017
 there was an
allowance for doubtful accounts of $183
000 and $33
100
 respectively.




&#8212; Inventories
include only the purchase cost and are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the FIFO
method. Inventories consist of raw materials and finished products. The Company establishes an inventory reserve to reduce the
value of the inventory during the period in which such materials and products are no longer usable or marketable. Specifically
the Company reviews inventory utilization during the past twelve months and also customer orders for subsequent months. If there
has been no utilization during the last 12 months and there are no orders in-place in future months which will require the use
of inventory item
 then inventory item will be included as part of the reserve during the period being evaluated. Management will
then specifically evaluate whether these items may be utilized within a reasonable time frame (e.g.
 3 to 6 months). In 2018 and
2017
 the Company recorded inventory reserves in the amount of $74
650 and $36
300
 respectively. The inventory reserve is included
in cost of revenue. Free Samples are recorded as cost of sales.




 &#8212;
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of property and equipment
is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset generally ranging from three to seven
years.





&#8212; In accordance with ASC Topic 360
 &#8220;Property
 Plant
 and Equipment&#8221; the Company reviews the carrying value of
intangibles and other long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparison of its
carrying amount to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If such assets are considered
to be impaired
 the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property
 if any
exceeds its fair value.




 &#8212;
As of January 1
 2018
 the Company adopted Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (&#8220;ASC 606&#8221;). The new guidance
sets forth a new five-step revenue recognition model which replaces the prior revenue recognition guidance in its entirety and
is intended to eliminate numerous industry-specific pieces of revenue recognition guidance that have historically existed in U.S.
GAAP. The underlying principle of the new standard is that a business or other organization will recognize revenue to depict the
transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects to receive in exchange for the goods
or services. The standard also requires more detailed disclosures and provides additional guidance for transactions that were not
addressed completely in the prior accounting guidance. The Company adopted the standard using the modified retrospective method
and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.


performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Product sales occur once control is transferred
upon delivery to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for
transferring goods. The amount of consideration the Company receives and revenue the Company recognizes varies with changes in
customer incentives the Company offers to its customers and their customers. Sales taxes and other similar taxes are excluded from
revenue.




&#8212;
From time to time the Company requires deposits in advance of delivery of products and/or production runs. Such amounts are initially
recorded as customer advances liability. The Company recognizes such revenue as it is earned in accordance with revenue recognition
policies.




 &#8212;
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company uses mainly radio
 local sampling events
 sponsorships
 endorsements
 and
digital advertising. The Company incurred advertising expense of approximately $13.8 million and $6.8 million
 during year ending
December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.





&#8212; Research and development costs are charged to general and administrative expenses as incurred and consist primarily of
consulting fees
 raw material usage and test productions of beverages. The Company incurred expenses of $572
000 and $360
000 during
year ending December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.




Foreign Currency Translation
&#8212; 
 foreign subsidiaries&#8217; functional currency is the local currency of operations and the net assets of
foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. The U.S. dollar results that arise from such
translation
 as well as exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances of long-term investment nature
 are included in Comprehensive
Income. The Company incurred foreign currency translation gains during the year ending in December 31
 2018 of approximately $12
400
and a loss of approximately $39
978 during the twelve months ending December 31
 2017.





&#8212; The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable
 accrued expenses
 and notes payable
approximates fair value due to their relative short-term maturity and market interest rates.




 -
ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally
 ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:



    
    

    
    

    
    

    
    

    
Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data
 which require the use of the reporting entity&#8217;s own assumptions.



the Company did not have any other assets or liabilities measured at fair value at December 31
 2018 and December 31
 2017.




The
Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740-10
 &#8220;Accounting for Income Taxes
&#8221; which requires
among other things
 an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires
the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred
tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized. The Company
follows the provisions of the ASC 740 -10 related to
When tax returns are
filed
 it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities
 while others
are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10
 the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the
period during which
 based on all available evidence
 management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained upon examination
 including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes
 if any.

Tax
positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition
threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement
with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount
measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along
with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes
its tax positions are all highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such
 the Company has not recorded a liability for
uncertain tax benefits.




settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively
settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered
effectively settled
 an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit
 even if the tax position is not considered more
likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open.


for tax years in 2015 through 2018 remain subject to potential examination by the taxing authorities.




&#8212;
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income (loss) available to stockholders by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common
and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the period. Dilutive common share equivalents consist of shares issuable
upon conversion of convertible debt
 exercise of stock options and warrants (calculated using the reverse treasury stock method).
As of December 31
 2018
 the convertible debt may be converted into additional shares of common stock amounting to 2
681
400.


shares equivalents
 including convertible notes and warrants
 as no common share equivalents had an exercise price below the ending
closing price of the year. The effects of dilutive instruments have not been presented as the effects would be anti-dilutive.




&#8212;The
Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 718 &#8220;Compensation &#8212; Stock Compensation&#8221; and related interpretations.
As such
 compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at the fair value of the share-based payments. Such compensation amounts
if any
 are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the grants. On April 30
 2015
 the Company adopted the 2015 Stock
Incentive Plan. This plan is intended to provide incentives which will attract and retain highly competent persons at all levels
as employees of the Company
 as well as independent contractors providing consulting or advisory services to the Company
 by providing
them opportunities to acquire the Company&#8217;s common stock or to receive monetary payments based on the value of such shares
pursuant to Awards issued. The 2015 Plan permits the grant of options and shares for up to 5
000
000 shares. In addition
 there
is a provision for an annual increase of 15% to the shares included under the plan
 with the shares to be added on the first day
of each calendar year
 beginning on January 1
 2017.




&#8212; Cost
of sales consists of the cost of concentrates and or beverage bases
 the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of
products
 co-packing fees
 repacking fees
 in-bound &#38; out-bound freight charges
 as well as certain internal transfer costs
warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the Company&#8217;s finished products and certain quality control costs.
Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans
 bottles
 other containers
 flavors
ingredients and packaging materials.




&#8212;
Operating expenses include selling expenses such as warehousing expenses after manufacture
 as well as expenses for advertising
samplings and in-store demonstrations costs
 costs for merchandise displays
 point-of-sale materials and premium items
 sponsorship
expenses
 other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs
 travel costs
professional service fees (including legal fees)
 depreciation and other general and administrative costs.




&#8212;
Shipping and handling costs for freight-out expense on goods shipped are included in cost of sales expenses in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income. Freight-out expense on goods shipped for year ended December 31
 2018 and 2017 was approximately
$5.5 million and $3.3 million
 respectively.







new accounting pronouncements as of the specified effective dates.

 We
have completed our initial assessment of the requirements of ASU No. 2016-02. We plan to adopt ASU No. 2016-02
 as amended
 effective
January 1
 2019. The adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of right to use assets and lease liabilities that
have not been previously recorded. Based on our initial assessment
 we do not expect that the adoption of the ASU will have a material
impact to our financial statements and disclosures. The company is continuing to monitor potential changes that have been proposed
by the FASB and will assess any necessary changes to the implementation process as the guidance is actualized.

The estimated measure of the percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.
