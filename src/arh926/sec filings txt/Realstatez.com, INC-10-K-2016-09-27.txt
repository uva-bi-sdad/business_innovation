We
are a bakery based company in California
 specializing in freshly-made cakes and cupcakes. On July 18
 2014
 we completed a share
exchange whereby we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Sweets &amp; Treats CA. Sweets &amp;
Treats CA became our wholly-owned subsidiary and we have operated our business through Sweets &amp; Treats CA since the Share
Exchange. On July 5
 2016
 the major shareholder and sole officer and director sold all of her shareholdings of the Company to
two new shareholders. The newly reformed Board of Directors believed it to be in the Company&rsquo;s best interest to pursue a
different business of the design and trading of touch screens. 

We
currently market our bakery products primarily through our website
 social media and personal referrals and market our touchscreen
related services via personal referrals. Our plan for the next twelve months calls for assessing the direction that should be
taken with the bakery business and development of the touchscreen business by marketing to further potential customers. The review
will consider whether the Company has been successful with its bakery business operations and whether to dispose of the bakery
business and focus solely on the touchscreen business. In July 2016
 we changed our Company name to &ldquo;Atlas Technology International
Inc.&rdquo; to indicate new ownership and a business under new leadership. 

Despite
our plan
 we currently have no commitments for any financing and cannot provide assurance that we will realize this goal.

Since
the period ending June 30
 2016
 we:


changed
                                         our name to &ldquo;Atlas Technology International
 Inc.&rdquo; effective upon approval
                                         from FINRA;


changed
                                         our fiscal year from July 31 to June 30;


elected
                                         Ming-Shu Tsai as a director and Ying-Chien Lin as a director and Chairman to the Board;


appointed
                                         Ming-Shu Tsai as a Co-CEO alongside Tiffany Aguayo;


filed
                                         a Certificate of Designation with the Secretary State of Delaware and amended the Articles
                                         of Incorporation by designating a total of 510
000 shares of the 1

created
                                         a wholly-owned Hong Kong limited company (&ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo;) under the name Atlas
                                         Tech Trading Limited on August 18
 2016


The
principal changes to our Certificate of Incorporation made in our State of Delaware Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of
Incorporation was the change of our name to Atlas Technology International
 Inc.


    
    



Our
Product &amp; Services

We
engage in the business of selling a wide variety of cupcakes and other baked goods under the brand name &ldquo;Sweets &amp; Treats&rdquo;.
We cater our products to customers in urban
 suburban
 commercial
 and residential markets.

Touchscreen
Services

We
design capacitive touchscreen based on our customer&rsquo;s requirements for rear view mirrors
 watches
 cell phones
 electronic
tablets
 GPS and other electronic products. A quality assured manufacturer with the technical know-how is then engaged for the
production of these newly designed products for our customers.



The
Company has yet to establish &ldquo;Atlas&rdquo; as a renowned brand but intends to develop it so that it too will stand for quality
innovation and service. The Company&rsquo;s services surround the design and selling of customized touchscreens. We operate in
a competitive market but we believe that our designs to customer requirements give us a competitive advantage over some of our
competitors. 

Marketing
and Promotion

Our
marketing efforts are comprised primarily of online social media and word of mouth advertising geared toward building brand recognition
and brand differentiation. We aim to build ourselves to be a leader in the gourmet cupcake market
 and attempt to reinforce on
a consistent basis that it should be a destination of choice for especially creative and delicious cupcakes. We also aim to be
a leader in the design and selling of touchscreens industry
 and attempt to establish
 expand and maintain customers for our touchscreen
services.



The
industry in which the Company conducts its bakery business is intensely competitive. We expect to compete with well-established
national
 regional and locally- owned traditional bakeries
 cupcake specific bakeries
 caf&eacute;s and other companies providing
baked goods and coffee. Additionally
 the Company expects to compete with certain quick-service restaurants
 delicatessens
 specialty
food stores
 take-out food service companies
 supermarkets and convenience stores. The principal factors on which the Company
competes are taste
 quality
 price of products offered
 customer service
 atmosphere
 convenience and overall customer experience.
Many competitors or potential competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources
 which may allow them to react
more quickly to changes in pricing
 marketing and other changing tastes of consumers. Because of relative low barriers of entry
of the industry
 we will continue to encounter additional competitors.

Company&rsquo;s principal executive office and mailing address is 8444 Reseda Blvd. Suite B
 Northridge
 California 91324. Our

has been provided the office space by Ms. Aguayo at no cost. Once our business grows and generates sufficient revenue

Market for Registrant&rsquo;s Common Equity
 Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

Our
common stock is currently quoted on OTC Markets under the symbol &ldquo;SWTS.&rdquo; There has been no established public trading
market for our common stock. The Company&rsquo;s shares of common stock are now listed with the OTCQB of the OTC Markets under
the symbol &ldquo;SWTS&rdquo;; however
 management does not expect any established trading market to develop in our shares of
common stock unless and until we have material operations. In any event
 no assurance can be given that any market for our common
stock will develop or be maintained. If a public market ever develops in the future
 the sale of shares of our common stock that
are deemed to be &ldquo;restricted securities&rdquo; pursuant to Rule 144 of the SEC by members of management or others may have
a substantial adverse impact on any such market. With the exception of the shares outlined below under the heading &ldquo;Recent
Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities
&rdquo; all current holders of shares of our common
stock have satisfied the six-month holding period requirement of Rule 144; these listed persons&rsquo; shares are subject to the
resale limitations outlined below under the heading &ldquo;Rule 144.&rdquo;

Our
common stock is quoted on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets Group under the symbol &ldquo;SWTS&rdquo;. The OTCQB is an inter-dealer
quotation and trading system and only market makers can apply to quote securities on the OTCQB. Trading in our common stock on
the OTCQB has been limited and sporadic and the quotations set forth below are not necessarily indicative of actual market conditions.


Holders
of Capital Stock

As
of the date of this Annual Report
 we had 38 holders of our common stock.
Stock
Option Grants

We
do not have a stock option plan in place and have not granted any stock options at this time.



To
date
 we have not declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. We currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends
in the foreseeable future on our common stock. Although we intend to retain our earnings
 if any
 to finance the exploration and
growth of our business
 our Board of Directors has the discretion to declare and pay dividends in the future.

Payment
of dividends in the future will depend upon our earnings
 capital requirements
 and any other factors that our Board of Directors
deems relevant.

You
should read the following discussion together with our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual
report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations
 estimates
and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and
expressed in such forward-looking statements.

Business
Overview

We
are a bakery based company in California
 specializing in freshly-made cakes and cupcakes and also offering other baked goods
as well as hot and cold beverages. The Company has entered the touchscreen industry through its Hong Kong subsidiary
 incorporated
on August 18
 2016
 specializing in the design and trading of touchscreen products and services. On July 18
 2014
 we completed
a share exchange whereby we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Sweets &amp; Treats CA. Sweets
&amp; Treats CA became our wholly-owned subsidiary and we have operated our business through Sweets &amp; Treats CA since the
Share Exchange.

We
currently market our baking products primarily through our website
 social media and personal referrals
 and the touchscreen products
primarily through personal referrals. Our plan for the next twelve months calls for reviewing the company&rsquo;s bakery business
and development of the touchscreen business. We anticipate that the cost for developing our touchscreen business will be approximately
$250
000. Despite our plan
 we currently have no commitments for any financing and cannot provide assurance that we will realize
this goal.


Plan
of Operations

Our
goal is to maintain the quality of our products and to build a sufficient customer base for the design and selling of touchscreen
products. We anticipate the cost for developing our touchscreen business will be approximately $500
000 within the next 12 months.
We have not commitments for any financing and cannot provide assurance that we will realize this goal.

If
we are unable to build a sustainable customer base
 we will cease our development and/or marketing operations until we raise money.
Attempting to raise capital after failing in any phase of our development plan could be difficult. As such
 if we cannot secure
additional proceeds we will have to cease operations and investors would lose their entire investment. We intend to raise additional
capital through private placements
 but there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve any capital-raising. If we need
additional cash but are unable to raise it
 we will either suspend marketing operations until we do raise the cash
 or cease operations
entirely. Other than as described in this paragraph
 we have no other financing plans.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

While
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our financial statements
 we believe that the following
accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion and analysis.


    
    



Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates may include those pertaining
to accruals and going concern assumption assessment. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.

Fair
value measurements and Fair value of Financial Instruments

We
follow paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial
instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;Paragraph 820-10-35-37&rdquo;) to
measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35- 37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value
in generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP)
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency
and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures
 Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy
which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy
gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest
priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described
below:




Level
    1
    
Quoted
    market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.

    
    
    

    
    
Pricing inputs other
    than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting

Pricing inputs that
    are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.


Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models
 discounted cash flow methodologies or
similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.

The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within
more than one level described above
 the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement of the instrument.

The
carrying amounts of our financial assets and liabilities
 such as cash
 prepaid professional fees
 and accrued expenses
 approximate
their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.

Transactions
involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis
 as the requisite conditions of competitive
free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties
 if made
 shall not imply that the
related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such
representations can be substantiated.


Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

From
time to time
 new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or other standard setting
bodies that are adopted by our company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed
 we believe that recently
issued accounting pronouncements adopted do not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

In
May 2014
 the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 &ldquo;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606)&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASU 2014-09&rdquo;).

This
guidance amends the existing FASB Accounting Standards Codification
 creating a new Topic 606
 Revenue from Contracts with Customer.
The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods
or services.

To
achieve that core principle
 an entity should apply the following steps:


Identify



Identify



Determine



Allocate



Recognize




    
    



The
ASU also provides guidance on disclosures that should be provided to enable financial statement users to understand the nature
amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue recognition and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Qualitative and quantitative
information is required about the following:


Contracts
                                         with customers &ndash; including revenue and impairments recognized
 disaggregation of
                                         revenue
 and information about contract balances and performance obligations (including
                                         the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations)

Significant
                                         judgments and changes in judgments &ndash; determining the timing of satisfaction of
                                         performance obligations (over time or at a point in time)
 and determining the transaction
                                         price and amounts allocated to performance obligations

Assets
                                         recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.

ASU
2014-09 is effective for periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim reporting periods within that reporting
period for all public entities. Early application is not permitted.

In
August 2014
 the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15 &ldquo;Presentation of Financial Statements&mdash;Going
Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&rsquo;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (&ldquo;ASU
2014-15&rdquo;).

In
connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period
 an entity&rsquo;s management should
evaluate whether there are conditions or events
 considered in the aggregate
 that raise substantial doubt about the entity&rsquo;s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one
year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). Management&rsquo;s evaluation should
be based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial statements are
issued (or at the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). Substantial doubt about an entity&rsquo;s
ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events
 considered in the aggregate
 indicate that
it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the
financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The term probable is used consistently with its use in Topic 450
Contingencies.

When
management identifies conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about an entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going
concern
 management should consider whether its plans that are intended to mitigate those relevant conditions or events will alleviate
the substantial doubt. The mitigating effect of management&rsquo;s plans should be considered only to the extent that (1) it is
probable that the plans will be effectively implemented and
 if so
 (2) it is probable that the plans will mitigate the conditions
or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern.

If
conditions or events raise substantial doubt about an entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern
 but the substantial
doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&rsquo;s plans
 the entity should disclose information that enables
users of the financial statements to understand all of the following (or refer to similar information disclosed elsewhere in the
footnotes):

a.&#9;Principal
conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern (before consideration
of management&rsquo;s 
b.
&#9;Management&rsquo;s evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entity&rsquo;s ability
to meet its obligations
c.&#9;Management&rsquo;s
plans that alleviated substantial doubt about the entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern.

If
conditions or events raise substantial doubt about an entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern
 and substantial doubt
is not alleviated after consideration of management&rsquo;s plans
 an entity should include a statement in the footnotes indicating
that there is substantial doubt about the entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date
that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). Additionally
 the entity should disclose information that
enables users of the financial statements to understand all of the following:

a.&#9;Principal
conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern
b.&#9;Management&rsquo;s
evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entity&rsquo;s ability to meet its obligations
c.&#9;Management&rsquo;s
plans that are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity&rsquo;s ability to
continue as a going concern.

The
amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15
 2016
 and for annual periods and interim
periods thereafter. Early application is permitted.

In
August 2015
 the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14 &ldquo;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606): Deferral of the Effective Date&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASU 2015-14&rdquo;).

The
amendments in this Update defer the effective date of Update 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities
 certain
not-for-profit entities
 and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15
 2017
 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted
only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim reporting periods within that reporting
period.

Management
does not believe that any recently issued
 but not yet effective accounting pronouncements
 when adopted
 will have a material
effect on the accompanying financial statements.


    
    



Results
of Operations

Eleven
Months Ended June 30
 2016 Compared to Twelve Months Ended July 31
 2015

We
generated revenue of $0 and $0 for the eleven months ended June 30
 2016 and twelve months ended July 31
 2015
 respectively.
We incurred operating expenses of $26
404 and $63
845 for the eleven months ended June 30
 2016 and twelve months July 31
 2015
respectively. The decrease of operating expenses is mainly attributable to the decrease in professional fees
 which decreased
from $61
538 for the twelve months ended July 31
 2015 to $15
633 for the eleven months ended June 30
 2016
 in addition to the
decrease of salary and wages to our officer. We had a net loss of
 $26
404 for the eleven months ended June 30
 2016 compared
to net income of $63
845 for the twelve months ended July 31
 2015.

Our
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis
 which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to recoverability
and classification of recorded amounts of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should our company be unable to continue
as a going concern.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

As
of June 30
 2016
 the Company had cash
 of $228. The Company&rsquo;s liabilities as of June 30
 2016 were $63
854
 which comprised
of $8
610 in accounts payable
 $444 in accrued liabilities
 and $54
800 as advances from a shareholder and a related party. As
of June 30
 2016
 the Company had a working capital deficit of $33
848.

As
of July 31
 2015
 the Company had cash
 of $531. The Company&rsquo;s liabilities as of July 31
 2015 were $33
048
 which comprised
of $22
525 in accounts payable
$371 in accrued liabilities
 and $10
152 as advances from a shareholder and a related party. As
of July 31
 2015
 the Company had a working capital deficit of $32
444.


The
following is a summary of the Company's cash flows provided by (used in) operating
 investing
 and financing activities for the
eleven months ended June 30
 2016:

For
the eleven months ended June 30
 2016
 the net cash used for operating activities was $44
951. The Company participated in no
investing activities for the eleven months ended June 30
 2016. The net cash provided by financing activities was $44
648 for
the eleven months ended June 30
 2016. The Company had a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $303 for the eleven months
ended June 30
 2016.

For
the twelve months ended July 31
 2015
 the net cash used for operating activities was $30
627. The Company participated in no
investing activities for the eleven months ended July 31
 2015. The net cash provided by financing activities was $30
202 for
the twelve months ended July 31
 2015. The Company had a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $425 for the twelve months
ended July 31
 2015.

We
have nominal assets and have generated little revenues since inception. We currently have no material commitments for capital
expenditures. We may be required to raise additional funds
 particularly if we are unable to continue generating positive cash
flow as a result of our operations. We estimate that based on current plans and assumptions
 that our available cash will not
be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements under our present operating expectations
 without further financing
 for up to
12 months. In addition
 our company may
 from time to time
 receive continued funding and capital resources from related parties.
However
 as of the date of this Annual Report
 such related parties do not have any existing obligation to advance funds or working
capital to support our business
 nor can our company rely on any advance funds from such related parties. Other than working capital
we presently have no other alternative source of working capital. We may not have sufficient working capital to fund the expansion
of our operations and to provide working capital necessary for our ongoing operations and obligations. We may need to raise significant
additional capital to fund our operating expenses
 pay our obligations
 and grow our company. We do not anticipate we will be
profitable in 2017. Therefore our future operations may be dependent on our ability to secure additional financing. Financing
transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities
 obtaining credit facilities
 or other financing mechanisms.
However
 a downturn in the U.S. equity and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance
of equity or debt securities. Even if we are able to raise the funds required
 it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs
and expenses
 fail to collect amounts owed to us
 or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative
financing. Furthermore
 if we issue additional equity or debt securities
 stockholders may experience additional dilution or the
new equity securities may have rights
 preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our Common Stock. The
inability to obtain additional capital will restrict our ability to grow and may reduce our ability to continue to conduct business
operations. If we are unable to obtain additional financing
 we will likely be required to curtail our marketing and development
plans and possibly cease our operations.


    
    



We
anticipate that depending on market conditions and our plan of operations
 we may incur operating losses in the foreseeable future.
Therefore
 our auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

Our
liquidity may be negatively impacted by the significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements
 costs
associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements
 including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
and other rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We expect all of these applicable rules and regulations
to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly.

Going
Concern

Our
financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates continuity of operations
realization of assets
 and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.

As
reflected in the financial statements
 we had an accumulated deficit at June 30
 2016
 a net loss and net cash used in operating
activities for the reporting period then ended. These factors raise substantial doubt from our auditor about our ability to continue
as a going concern.

We
are attempting to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue; however
 our cash position may not be sufficient to support
its daily operations. While we believe in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue
and in its ability to raise additional funds
 there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of our company to continue
as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to further implement our business plan and generate sufficient revenue and in
our ability to raise additional funds.


Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Contractual
Obligations

We
do not have any contractual obligations at this time.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Atlas
Technology International
 Inc.
Sylmar
CA

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Atlas Technology International
 Inc. and its subsidiaries (formerly
Sweets &amp; Treats
 Inc.) (collectively the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of June 30
 2016 and July 31
 2015
 and the related consolidated
statements of operations
 stockholders&rsquo; equity and cash flows for the 11month period ended June 30
 2016 and for the year
ended July 31
 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining
on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion
 the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position
of Atlas Technology International
 Inc. and its subsidiaries as of June 30
 2016 and July 31
 2015 and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for 11month period ended June 30
 2016 and for the year ended July 31
 2015
 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 3 to the financial statements
 the Company has accumulated losses from operations since inception and has a working capital
deficit as of June 30
 2016. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
Management's plans in this regard are described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 cupcakes
 desserts and special events catering.

Atlas
Technology International
 Inc. (fka Sweets &amp; Treats
 Inc.) (&ldquo;DE Corp&rdquo;)

Atlas
Technology International
 Inc. (fka Sweets &amp; Treats
 Inc.) (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) was incorporated on July 7
 2014 under

On
July 18
 2014
 the Company issued 5
000
000 shares of the newly formed corporation&rsquo;s common stock to the President of the
Predecessor for all of the Predecessor&rsquo;s issued and outstanding capital stock. No value was given to the common stock issued
by the newly formed corporation.&nbsp;Therefore
 the shares were recorded to reflect the $0.00001 par value and paid in capital
was recorded as a negative amount of ($50). The acquisition process utilizes the capital structure of the Company and the assets
and liabilities of Predecessor
 which are recorded at historical cost.

The
Company applied paragraph 505-10-S99-3 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (formerly Topic 4B of the Staff Accounting
Bulletins (&ldquo;SAB&rdquo;) (&ldquo;SAB Topic 4B&rdquo;) issued by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the

Note
2 - Significant and Critical Accounting Policies and Practices

The
Management of the Company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness
of accounting policies and their application. Critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important
to the portrayal of the Company&rsquo;s financial condition and results and require management&rsquo;s most difficult
 subjective
or complex judgments
 often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
The Company&rsquo;s significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted
accounting principles.

Fiscal
Year End

The
Company elected to amend its fiscal year ending date July 31

Basis
of Presentation 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (&ldquo;U.S. GAAP&rdquo;). Certain prior year amounts have been combined and reclassified
to conform to the current year presentation.



    
    


Use
of Estimates and Assumptions and Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date(s) of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period(s).

Critical
accounting estimates are estimates for which (a) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and
judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact
of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material. The Company&rsquo;s critical accounting estimates
and assumptions affecting the financial statements were:


Allowance
                                         for doubtful accounts
                                         accounts is based on historical sales
 historical loss levels
 and an analysis of the
                                         collectability of individual accounts; and general economic conditions that may affect
                                         a client&rsquo;s ability to pay. The Company evaluated the key factors and assumptions
                                         used to develop the allowance in determining that it is reasonable in relation to the
                                         financial statements taken as a whole.

Assumption
Management
                                         assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates continuity
                                         of operations
 realization of assets
 and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course
                                         of business

Valuation
Management
                                         assumes that the realization of the Company&rsquo;s net deferred tax assets resulting
                                         from its net operating loss (&ldquo;NOL&rdquo;) carry&ndash;forwards for Federal income
                                         tax purposes that may be offset against future taxable income was not considered more
                                         likely than not and accordingly
 the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards
                                         are offset by a full valuation allowance. Management made this assumption based on (a)
                                         the Company has incurred recurring losses
 (b) general economic conditions
 and (c) its
                                         ability to raise additional funds to support its daily operations by way of a public
                                         or private offering
 among other factors.

These
significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached
to these estimates or assumptions
 and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.

Management
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the
financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.

Management
regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information
 changes
in facts and circumstances
 historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations
 if deemed appropriate
 those
estimates are adjusted accordingly.

Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Principles
of Consolidation

The
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&quot;ASC&quot;)
Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 810-10-15-10

interest&mdash;shall be consolidated except (1) when control does not rest with the parent
 the majority owner; (2) if the parent
is a broker-dealer within the scope of Topic 940 and control is likely to be temporary; (3) consolidation by an investment company
the
usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority voting interest
 and
 therefore
 as a general
rule ownership by one reporting entity
 directly or indirectly
 of more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares of another
entity is a condition pointing toward consolidation. The power to control may also exist with a lesser percentage of ownership
for example
 by contract
 lease
 agreement with other stockholders
all
less-than-majority-owned subsidiaries
 if any
 in which the parent&rsquo;s power to control exists.

The
Company consolidates the following



Name
    of consolidated subsidiary or entity
State
    or other jurisdiction of incorporation or organization
Date
                                         of incorporation or formation

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The
Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial
instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;Paragraph 820-10-35-37&rdquo;) to
measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP)
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency
and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures
 Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy
which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy
gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest
priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described
below:



Level
    1
    
Quoted
    market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.

    
    
    

    
    
Pricing inputs other
    than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting
    date.

    
    
    

    
    
Pricing inputs that
    are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.


Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models
 discounted cash flow methodologies or
similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.

The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within
more than one level described above
 the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement of the instrument.

The
carrying amounts of the Company&rsquo;s financial assets and liabilities
 such as cash
 accounts receivable
 prepaid expenses
accounts payable
 accrued expenses
 customer deposits and sales tax payable approximate their fair values because of the short
maturity of these instruments.

Transactions
involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis
 as the requisite conditions of competitive
free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties
 if made
 shall not imply that the
related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such
representations can be substantiated.

Cash
Equivalents

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Related
Parties

The
Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure
of related party transactions.

Pursuant
to Section 850-10-20 the related parties include a.&nbsp;affiliates of the Company (&ldquo;Affiliate&rdquo; means
 with respect
to any specified Person
 any other Person that
 directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries
 controls
 is controlled
by or is under common control with such Person
 as such terms are used in and construed under Rule 405 under the Securities Act);
b.&nbsp;entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required
 absent the election of the fair value option
under the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section 825&ndash;10&ndash;15
 to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing
entity; c.&nbsp;trusts for the benefit of employees
 such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the
trusteeship of management; d. principal owners of the Company; e.&nbsp;management of the Company; f.&nbsp;other parties with which
the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to
an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g.&nbsp;other
parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership
interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting
parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.

The
financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions
 other than compensation arrangements
 expense
allowances
 and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However
 disclosure of transactions that are eliminated
in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall
include: a.&nbsp;the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b. a description of the transactions
 including transactions to which
no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed
 for each of the periods for which income statements are presented
 and such other
information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c.&nbsp;the dollar
amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the
method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and d.&nbsp;amounts due from or to related parties as
of the date of each balance sheet presented and
 if not otherwise apparent
 the terms and manner of settlement.


    
    



Commitment
and Contingencies

The
Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain
conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued
 which may result in a loss to the Company
but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities
and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings
that are pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings
 the Company evaluates the perceived
merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected
to be sought therein.

If
the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability
can be estimated
 then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements. If the
assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible
 or is probable but
cannot be estimated
 then the nature of the contingent liability
 and an estimate of the range of possible losses
 if determinable
and material
 would be disclosed.

Loss
contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees
 in which case the guarantees would
be disclosed.

Revenue
Recognition

The
Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes
revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all
of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 (ii) the product has been shipped or the
services have been rendered to the customer
 (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable
 and (iv) collectability is reasonably
assured.

Deferred
Tax Assets and Income Tax Provision

The
Company was a Subchapter S corporation
 until July 17
 2014 during which time the Company was treated as a pass through entity
for federal income tax purposes. Under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code stockholder of an S corporation are taxed separately
on their distributive share of the S corporation&rsquo;s income whether or not that income is actually distributed.

Effective
July 18
 2014
 the Company accounts for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred
income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets
and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected
to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than
not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that
includes the enactment date.

The
Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;Section 740-10-25&rdquo;). Section 740-10-25
addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the
financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25
 the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if
it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
 based on the technical
merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based
on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section
740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition
 classification
 interest and penalties on income taxes
 accounting in interim
periods and requires increased disclosures.

The
estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets
 as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability
of deferred tax assets recorded on its consolidated balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.
Management
makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous
estimates of tax liability. In addition
 the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in
these jurisdictions. In management&rsquo;s opinion
 adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual
taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates
 additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.


    
    



Earnings
per Share

Earnings
per share (&quot;EPS&quot;) is the amount of earnings attributable to each share of common stock. For convenience
 the term is
used to refer to either earnings or loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16 Basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available
to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the
period. Income available to common stockholders shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred
stock (whether or not paid) and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned)
from income from continuing operations (if that amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation
of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional
common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect
the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement
 stock options
or warrants.

Pursuant
to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-45-21 through 260-10-45-45-23 Diluted EPS shall be based on the most advantageous conversion rate
or exercise price from the standpoint of the security holder. The dilutive effect of outstanding call options and warrants (and
their equivalents) issued by the reporting entity shall be reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method
unless the provisions of paragraphs 260-10-45-35 through 45-36 and 260-10-55-8 through 55-11 require that another method be applied.
Equivalents of options and warrants include non-vested stock granted to employees
 stock purchase contracts
 and partially paid
stock subscriptions (see paragraph 260&ndash;10&ndash;55&ndash;23). Anti-dilutive contracts
 such as purchased put options and
purchased call options
 shall be excluded from diluted EPS. Under the treasury stock method: a.&nbsp;Exercise of options and warrants
shall be assumed at the beginning of the period (or at time of issuance
 if later) and common shares shall be assumed to be issued.
b.&nbsp;The proceeds from exercise shall be assumed to be used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the
period. (See paragraphs 260-10-45-29 and 260-10-55-4 through 55-5.) c.&nbsp;The incremental shares (the difference between the
number of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed purchased) shall be included in the denominator of the diluted
EPS computation.

There
were no potentially dilutive common shares outstanding for the reporting period ended June 30
 2016 and July 31
 2015.

Cash
Flows Reporting

The
Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting
 classifies cash
receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating
 investing
 or financing activities and provides definitions
of each category
 and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (&ldquo;Indirect method&rdquo;) as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile
it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and
payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income
that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments. The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency
cash flows
 using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held
in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents
and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the
period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.

Subsequent
Events

The
Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent
events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the&nbsp;financial statements were issued. Pursuant
to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
 the Company as an SEC filer considers its financial statements issued
when they are widely distributed to users
 such as through filing them on EDGAR.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Management
does not believe that any recently issued
 but not effective
 accounting standards
 if currently adopted
 would have a material
effect on the Company's financial statements.


    
    



Note
3 &ndash; Going Concern

The
Company has elected to adopt early application of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15

Statements&mdash;Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&rsquo;s Ability to Continue as a
Going Concern (&ldquo;ASU 2014-15&rdquo;)

The
Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern
 which
contemplates continuity of operations
 realization of assets
 and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.

As
reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
 the Company had an accumulated deficit at June 30
 2016
 a net
loss and net cash used in operating activities for the reporting period then ended. These factors raise substantial doubt about
the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern.

The
Company is attempting to generate sufficient revenue; however
 its cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations.
While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate sufficient revenues and in its ability to raise additional
funds
 there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon
the Company&rsquo;s ability to further implement its business plan
 generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional
funds.

The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded
asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern.

Business
Advisory Agreements

On
June 24
 2016
consulting agreements
with Bright Light Marketing (&ldquo;the Consultants&rdquo;) 



The
Consultants will provide consulting support and advisory services to include public relations
 advertising
 business advise
 crisis
communications and corporate publicity.



The
Agreement shall commence on the date above and shall continue for a period of twelve (12) months.



Upon
signing of the Agreements
 the Consultants will be granted 100
000 shares of the Company's common stock.

Accounting
Treatment of the Consideration

The
Company valued 100
000 common shares issued to the Consultants for obtaining services at $0.25 per share
 the most recent market
trading price
 or $25
000 in aggregate
 and booked the fair value of the equity instruments issued as prepaid consulting fees

Note
7 &ndash; Deferred Tax Assets and Income Tax Provision

Deferred
Tax Assets

At
June 30
 2016
 the Company had net operating loss (&ldquo;NOL&rdquo;) carry&ndash;forwards for Federal income tax purposes of
approximately $90
000 that may be offset against future taxable income through 2035. No tax benefit has been reported with respect
to these net operating loss carry-forwards because the Company believes that the realization of the Company&rsquo;s net deferred
tax assets of approximately $30
580 was not considered more likely than not and accordingly
 the potential tax benefits of the
net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance.


    
    



Deferred
tax&nbsp;assets consist primarily of the tax effect of NOL carry-forwards. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance
on the deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty regarding the probability of its realization.&nbsp;&nbsp;The valuation allowance
increased approximately $8
978 and $21
602 for the reporting period ended June 30
 2016 and July 31
 2015
 respectively.

Components
of deferred tax assets in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;)
 the Company carried out an evaluation
with the participation of the Company's management
 including the Company's Co-Chief Executive Officers (the Company's principal
executive officer and interim principal accounting officer)
 of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation
the Company's Co-Chief Executive Officers concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act
is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms
 and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management
 including Co-Chief Executive Officers
 as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management&rsquo;s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The
management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for
the Company. Our internal control system was designed to
 in general
 provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management
and board regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements
 but because of its inherent limitations
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30
 2016. The framework
used by management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled &ldquo;Internal Control &ndash;
Integrated Framework&rdquo; issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment
our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective
 as of June 30
 2016. This was due
to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal control over financial reporting that adversely affected
our internal controls and that amounted to material weaknesses.

The
matters involving internal control over financial reporting that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a
majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors
 resulting in ineffective
oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties
consistent with control objectives of having segregation of the initiation of transactions
 the recording of transactions and
the custody of assets; and (3) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned
material weaknesses were identified by our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer in connection with the review
of our financial statements as of June 30
 2016.

To
address the material weaknesses set forth in items (2) and (3) discussed above
 management performed additional analyses and other
procedures to ensure that the financial statements included herein fairly present
 in all material respects
 our financial position
results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.

Management's
Remediation Initiatives

In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls
 we plan to
initiate
 the following series of measures:

We
plan to increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available
to us. First
 we plan to create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives of having separate individuals
perform (i) the initiation of transactions
 (ii) the recording of transactions and (iii) the custody of assets. Second
 we will
create a senior position to focus on financial reporting and standardizing and documenting our accounting procedures with the
goal of increasing the effectiveness of the internal controls in preventing and detecting misstatements of accounting information.
Third
 we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee
resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required
internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available
to us.

Management
believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors
 who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee
will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board. We did not implement
the said remedial measures in eleven months ended June 30
 2016. We anticipate that these remedial measures will be implemented
when our financial conditions permit.


    
    



Changes
in Internal Controls over financial reporting

No
change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the eleven months ended June 30
 2016 that has materially
affected
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

Certain
Related Party Transactions

Advances

 CEO and Significant Stockholder

From
time to time
 the stockholder of the Company advances funds to the Company for working capital purpose. Those advances are unsecured
non-interest bearing and due on demand.

Tiffany
Aguayo
 the President
 CEO and majority shareholder of the Company advanced $44
648 and $152 during the twelve months ended June
30
 2016 and eleven months ended July 31
 2015
 respectively
 none of which has been repaid. Ms. Aguayo also advanced $5
000 and

Free
Office Space

We
have been provided office space by our Co-Chief Executive Officer Tiffany Aguayo at no cost. The management determined that such
cost is nominal and did not recognize the rent expense in its financial statement.


Indebtedness
of Management

No
officer
 director or security holder known to us to own of record or beneficially more than 5% of our common stock or any member
of the immediate family or sharing the household (other than a tenant or employee) of any of the foregoing persons is indebted
to us.

Transactions
with Promoters

We
did not expressly engage a promoter at the time of its formation. Due to Ms. Aguayo&rsquo;s initiative in founding and organizing
the business of the Company
 she may be deemed to be a promoter under Securities Act Rule 405.

Independence
of the Board of Directors

For
purposes of determining director independence
 we have applied the definitions set out in NASDAQ Rule 4200(a)(15). Under NASDAQ
Rule 4200(a)(15)
 a director is not considered to be independent if he or she is also an executive officer or employee of the
corporation or has been
 at any time during the past three years
 employed by the company. Accordingly
 we do not have any independent
director as of the date of this registration statement.

All
Other Fees

Pursuant
to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 the registrant has duly caused this report
to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

Effective
May 6
 2003
 the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules that require that before our auditor is engaged by us to render
any auditing or permitted non-audit related service
 the engagement be:


approved
by our audit committee; or


entered
into pursuant to pre-approval policies and procedures established by the audit committee
 provided the policies and procedures
are detailed as to the particular service
 the audit committee is informed of each service
 and such policies and procedures do
not include delegation of the audit committee's responsibilities to management.


We
do not have an audit committee. Our entire board of directors pre-approves all services provided by our independent auditors.

The
pre-approval process has just been implemented in response to the new rules. Therefore
 our board of directors does not have records
of what percentage of the above fees were pre-approved. However
 all of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved
by the entire board of directors either before or after the respective services were rendered.

 which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one&#13;or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities
 and such assessment inherently&#13;involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company&#13;or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings

 then the estimated&#13;liability would be accrued in the Company&amp;#146;s consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential&#13;material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible

&#13;the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position&#13;will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized&#13;in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty&#13;percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition
&#13;classification
 interest and penalties on income taxes

 as well&#13;as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded&#13;on its consolidated balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.&lt;br clear=all /&gt;&#13;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;Management makes judgments as to the interpretation&#13;of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In addition
 the&#13;Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. In management&amp;#146;s opinion
&#13;adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates

 the term is used to refer to either earnings or&#13;loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs&#13;260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16 Basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the numerator)&#13;by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Income available to common stockholders&#13;shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred stock (whether or not paid) and the dividends&#13;accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from income from continuing operations (if that&#13;amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation&#13;of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding&#13;if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from&#13;common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement

 and partially paid stock subscriptions (see paragraph 260&amp;#150;10&amp;#150;55&amp;#150;23).&#13;Anti-dilutive contracts

&#13;the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position&#13;will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized&#13;in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty&#13;percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

 the term is used to refer to either earnings or&#13;loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs&#13;260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16 Basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the numerator)&#13;by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Income available to common stockholders&#13;shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred stock (whether or not paid) and the dividends&#13;accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from income from continuing operations (if that&#13;amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation&#13;of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding&#13;if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from&#13;common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement

Note 2 - Significant and Critical Accounting
Policies and Practices

The Management
of the Company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of accounting
policies and their application. Critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important to the portrayal
of the Company&#146;s financial condition and results and require management&#146;s most difficult
 subjective
 or complex judgments
often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company&#146;s
significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted accounting principles.




ending date July 31




and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;). Certain prior year amounts have been combined and reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Use of Estimates and Assumptions and
Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions


conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date(s) of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period(s).

Critical
accounting estimates are estimates for which (a) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment
necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact of the estimate
on financial condition or operating performance is material. The Company&#146;s critical accounting estimates and assumptions
affecting the financial statements were:



    
    
: Management&#146;s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical sales

 the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance. Management made this assumption based on (a) the Company has incurred recurring losses

of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Paragraph 820-10-35-37&#148;) to measure the fair value of its financial
instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles
(U.S. GAAP)
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements
and related disclosures
 Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair
value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:

 the Company accounts
for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured
using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are
reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.


FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Section 740-10-25&#148;). Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether
tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25
the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position
will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized
in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty
percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition

amount of earnings attributable to each share of common stock. For convenience
 the term is used to refer to either earnings or
loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs
260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16 Basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the numerator)
by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Income available to common stockholders
shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred stock (whether or not paid) and the dividends
accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from income from continuing operations (if that
amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation
of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding
if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from
common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement
 stock options or warrants.


through 260-10-45-45-23 Diluted EPS shall be based on the most advantageous conversion rate or exercise price from the standpoint
of the security holder. The dilutive effect of outstanding call options and warrants (and their equivalents) issued by the reporting
entity shall be reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method unless the provisions of paragraphs 260-10-45-35
through 45-36 and 260-10-55-8 through 55-11 require that another method be applied. Equivalents of options and warrants include
non-vested stock granted to employees
 stock purchase contracts
 and partially paid stock subscriptions (see paragraph 260&#150;10&#150;55&#150;23).
Anti-dilutive contracts
 such as purchased put options and purchased call options
 shall be excluded from diluted EPS. Under the
treasury stock method: a.&#160;Exercise of options and warrants shall be assumed at the beginning of the period (or at time of
issuance
 if later) and common shares shall be assumed to be issued. b.&#160;The proceeds from exercise shall be assumed to be
used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. (See paragraphs 260-10-45-29 and 260-10-55-4 through
55-5.) c.&#160;The incremental shares (the difference between the number of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed
purchased) shall be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS computation.

Use of Estimates and Assumptions and
Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions


conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date(s) of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period(s).

Critical
accounting estimates are estimates for which (a) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment
necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact of the estimate
on financial condition or operating performance is material. The Company&#146;s critical accounting estimates and assumptions
affecting the financial statements were:



    
    
: Management&#146;s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical sales
 historical loss levels
 and an analysis of the collectability of individual accounts; and general economic conditions that may affect a client&#146;s ability to pay. The Company evaluated the key factors and assumptions used to develop the allowance in determining that it is reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.




    
    
Management assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates continuity of operations
 realization of assets
 and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business




    
    
Management assumes that the realization of the Company&#146;s net deferred tax assets resulting from its net operating loss (&#147;NOL&#148;) carry&#150;forwards for Federal income tax purposes that may be offset against future taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly
 the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance. Management made this assumption based on (a) the Company has incurred recurring losses
 (b) general economic conditions
 and (c) its ability to raise additional funds to support its daily operations by way of a public or private offering
 among other factors.



bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions
 and certain estimates
or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.


experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole
under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources.


and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information
 changes in facts and circumstances
 historical
experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations
 if deemed appropriate
 those estimates are adjusted accordingly.

the usual condition
for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority voting interest

 therefore
 as a general rule ownership by

pointing toward consolidation. The power to control may also exist with a lesser percentage of ownership

of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Paragraph 820-10-35-37&#148;) to measure the fair value of its financial
instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles
(U.S. GAAP)
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements
and related disclosures
 Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair
value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:



    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.

 discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one
significant model assumption or input is unobservable.


priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above
 the
categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.

FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the
consolidated financial statements are issued
 which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one
or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities
 and such assessment inherently
involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company
or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings
 the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings
or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.

material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible
 or is probable but cannot be estimated
 then the nature of
the contingent liability
 and an estimate of the range of possible losses
 if determinable and material
 would be disclosed.

of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable
and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists
 (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer
 (iii)
the sales price is fixed or determinable
 and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.









until July 17
 2014 during which time the Company was treated as a pass through entity for federal income tax purposes. Under Subchapter
S of the Internal Revenue Code stockholder of an S corporation are taxed separately on their distributive share of the S corporation&#146;s
income whether or not that income is actually distributed.


 2014
 the Company accounts
for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured
using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are
reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.


FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Section 740-10-25&#148;). Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether
tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25
the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position
will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized
in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty
percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition
classification
 interest and penalties on income taxes
 accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.


differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
 as well
as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded
on its consolidated balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.



of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In addition
 the
Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. In management&#146;s opinion
adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates
additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.









amount of earnings attributable to each share of common stock. For convenience
 the term is used to refer to either earnings or
loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs
260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16 Basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the numerator)
by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Income available to common stockholders
shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred stock (whether or not paid) and the dividends
accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from income from continuing operations (if that
amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation
of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding
if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from
common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement
 stock options or warrants.


through 260-10-45-45-23 Diluted EPS shall be based on the most advantageous conversion rate or exercise price from the standpoint
of the security holder. The dilutive effect of outstanding call options and warrants (and their equivalents) issued by the reporting
entity shall be reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method unless the provisions of paragraphs 260-10-45-35
through 45-36 and 260-10-55-8 through 55-11 require that another method be applied. Equivalents of options and warrants include
non-vested stock granted to employees
 stock purchase contracts
 and partially paid stock subscriptions (see paragraph 260&#150;10&#150;55&#150;23).
Anti-dilutive contracts
 such as purchased put options and purchased call options
 shall be excluded from diluted EPS. Under the
treasury stock method: a.&#160;Exercise of options and warrants shall be assumed at the beginning of the period (or at time of
issuance
 if later) and common shares shall be assumed to be issued. b.&#160;The proceeds from exercise shall be assumed to be
used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. (See paragraphs 260-10-45-29 and 260-10-55-4 through
55-5.) c.&#160;The incremental shares (the difference between the number of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed
purchased) shall be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS computation.

of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting
 classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether
they stem from operating
 investing
 or financing activities and provides definitions of each category
 and uses the indirect or
reconciliation method (&#147;Indirect method&#148;) as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities
by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating
cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments.
The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows
 using the current exchange rate at the time
of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in
the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing
and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1 of the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification.









855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent
events through the date when the&#160;financial statements were issued. Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards
