ITEM
1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS



Curative
Biosciences
 Inc.
 formerly Amaize Beverage Corporation
 (&ldquo;the Company&rdquo;
 &ldquo;the Registrant&rdquo;
 &ldquo;we&rdquo;
&ldquo;us&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) is a life sciences company focused on developing and commercializing novel therapeutics
using hemp-derived CBD. Our consumer product segment is focused on manufacturing
 marketing and selling plant-based CBD products
to a range of market sectors.

Through
our consumer products business
 we plan to manufacture
 market and sell consumer products containing plant-based CBD under our
. All of our products are non-psychoactive allowing for the global distribution of our hemp oil
into international markets that have a zero tolerance for any levels of THC.

We
expect to realize revenue from our consumer products business segment to fund a portion of our working capital needs
 however
we will need to raise additional capital either through the issuance of equity and/or the issuance of debt. Given the small size
of our company and the development stage of the Company
 we may find it difficult to raise sufficient capital to meet our needs.
We do not have any firm commitments for all of our capital needs
 and there are no assurances they will be available to us. We
made no sales during the twelve months ended June 30
 2017 or 2016.

Our
principal executive office address is 2 South Biscayne Boulevard
 #3760
 Miami
 Florida 33131 and our telephone number is (949)
287-3164.



Curative
Biosciences
 Inc.
 formerly Amaize Beverage Corporation is organized under the laws of the state of Nevada. The Board of Directors
and the majority shareholders of the Company constituting a total of 9
180
143 shares of common stock (58.44%) approved as of
August 29
 2017
 in a written consent of the Board of Directors and the majority of the shareholders of the Company as of the
same date
 a name change from &ldquo;Amaize Beverage Corporation&rdquo; to &ldquo;Curative Biosciences
 Inc.&rdquo; The Company
believes that its new name will better reflect the new direction of the Company&rsquo;s business
 that of developing and commercializing
novel therapeutics using hemp-derived CBD. The Company seeks to manufacture
 market and sell consumer products containing plant-based
. On October 6
 2017
 the Company filed an amendment to its articles of incorporation
(the &ldquo;Amendment&rdquo;) with the Secretary of State of the state of Nevada. The Amendment provided for the change of the
Company&rsquo;s name from Amaize Beverage Corporation to its current name
 Curative Biosciences
 Inc. The Company submitted to
FINRA an Issuer Company Related Action Notification for the name change and request for a new trading symbol and is waiting to
be declared effective by FINRA. The Company will announce the name and symbol change once it has been declared effective. 

BUSINESS
OVERVIEW

In
November 2013
 Richard Damion joined our Company as the acting Chief Executive Officer. He was then approved by the Board of Directors
as the Company&rsquo;s President and Chief Executive Officer in January 2014. On February 15
 2015
 the Board of Directors of
the Company appointed A.R. Grandsaert as the Company&rsquo;s new President. Richard Damion resigned as the Company&rsquo;s President
as of that date; however
 he remains the Company&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer and Director.

We
determined during the first quarter of 2015 that we would transition out of our lower margin
 perishable snack food product lines.
The Company intends to manufacture and market natural health products and operate within the medical cannabis industry. We are
brand. The demand for hemp-derived CBD
products has grown at an estimated 22% CAGR over the last three years and is expected to increase substantially over the next
five years. Curative Biosciences aims to be a significant player in the industry.

We
are a virtual company with distributed employees. We focus on staying lean through the employment of cloud based technologies
maintaining low overhead
 subcontracting services
 creating sales through commissioned brokers
 developing products through reputable
co-packers and keeping minimum inventory to ensure freshness and shelf life for our customers and distribution partners.

OUR
PRODUCTS 

Our
product formulas are derived from natural genetic strains of phytocannabinoid-rich hemp and are grown using 100% organic farming
practices. The plants are registered with the Colorado State Department of Agriculture and tested to ensure the THC levels are
All of our products are non-psychoactive
allowing for global distribution into international markets that have a zero tolerance for any levels of THC. The extraction and
purification processing technology used in the manufacturing of our products preserves all the phytocannabinoids
 terpenes
 and
plant lipids
 while eliminating any remaining THC and chlorophyll.

Our
Curative brand Softgels have been developed with a patent pending water-soluble liquid with CBD
 and other phytocannabinoids including
CBG
 CBN
 CBC
 and over 40 naturally present terpenes. We plan to offer the Curative brand of softgels in 30 and 60 count bottles
of &ldquo;body ready&rdquo; potencies designed to deliver 10mg CBD and 25mg of CBD per serving. We designed the Curative Softgels

formula utilizes proprietary water-soluble hemp oil
 increasing bioavailability by an order of magnitude compared with an oil
form.

Our
Curative brand of Tinctures have been developed with cannabidiol (CBD) oil in varying concentrations and formulated using our
full spectrum hemp oil blended with hemp seed oil
 grape seed oil
 or MCT derived from coconut oil. Our Tinctures contain no THC.


    
    



DISTRIBUTION


We
intend to employ several distribution methods to ensure maximum growth
 market share and profitability. Initially
 we plan to
focus our distribution efforts on ecommerce and targeted specialty retail shops.

Our
marketing efforts will be focused on online consumers and retail distribution channels in the United States. We believe this approach
is ideal for our products market as it provides an opportunity to focus our marketing efforts on educating targeted customers
about the potential health benefits of CBD and other key ingredients in our products.

INDUSTRY
OUTLOOK

Hemp
Business Journal&rsquo;s data demonstrates the hemp industry is growing with a 22% CAGR
 and they estimate that the hemp industry
will grow to $1.8 billion USD in sales by 2020
 led by food
 body care

2 

The
report estimated $130 million USD in hemp-derived CBD sales in 2016. This category is being driven by channel sales in the natural
products industry
 smoke shops and online verticals
 with pharmaceutical players quickly moving into position to capture market
share.

The
US medical cannabis market is a rapidly growing market with estimated retail cannabis sales rising from an estimated $2.2-$2.6
 A 2016 Bloomberg report predicted the US cannabis market to reach
$50 billion USD by 2026.

THE
LAW AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS 

For
the first time since 1937
 industrial hemp has been decriminalized at the federal level and can be grown legally in the United
States
 but on a limited basis. A landmark provision passed in the Agricultural Act of 2014 recognizes hemp as distinct from its
genetic cousin
 marijuana. Federal law now exempts industrial hemp from U.S. drug laws to allow for crop research by universities
colleges and state agriculture departments. The new Federal law allows for agricultural pilot programs for industrial hemp &ldquo;in
states that permit the growth or cultivation of hemp.&rdquo;

COMPETITION


The
hemp derived CBD sector of the cannabis industry is in its infancy. Competition is highly fragmented with no dominant player.
Curative&rsquo;s competition will include CW Hemp
 Medical Marijuana
 Inc.
 CV Sciences
 Bluebird Botanicals
 and Elixinol
 among
others. There are also large nutritional companies that currently do not offer hemp derived CBD products but may in the future.
We expect this and new entrants in the marketplace in the coming years.

We
expect Curative to be competitive in the marketplace as we intend to focus our efforts on social media
 education and awareness
beautifully designed eco-friendly packaging
 competitive pricing
 quality and potency in product formulation and a superior customer
experience.

We
expect to realize revenue from our consumer products business segment to fund a portion of our working capital needs
 however
we will need to raise additional capital either through the issuance of equity and/or the issuance of debt. Given the small size
of our company and the development stage of the Company
 we may find it difficult to raise sufficient capital to meet our needs.
We do not have any firm commitments for all of our capital needs
 and there are no assurances they will be available to us.

at $25
000 (25
000 shares) resulting in a non-cash loss on settlement of liabilities of $16
125. The significant decrease in our
general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30
 2017 was due to the reduction in professional fees
 technology
and independent contractor expenses.

Settlement
of Liabilities with Equity

During
the year ended June 30
 2017 the Company issued 150
000 shares of common stock to a related party valued at $37
500 in settlement
of accounts payable of $16
500 and services valued at $21
000.

During
the year ended June 30
 2016 the Company issued 25
000 shares of common stock valued at $25
000 in settlement of liabilities to
a related party of $8
575 resulting in a non-cash loss on settlement of liabilities $16
125.

Provision
for Income Taxes

We
incurred taxable losses
 consequently
 no liability for taxation was incurred during the years ended June 30
 2017 or 2016.

Net
Loss

The
net loss for the year ended June 30
 2017 was $53
195 as compared to $1
657
286 for the year ended June 30
 2016. The variances
between the periods primarily arose due to the non-cash loss on settlement of liabilities described above.

Liquidity
and Ca

The
Company had no cash balance as of June 30
 2017 and a working capital deficit as follows:



Total
    Current Assets
    

Total
    Current Liabilities
(633
065

Working
    Capital Deficit
(633
065


The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company&rsquo;s ability to raise additional capital
and to successfully implement its business plan. Management believes that the actions presently being taken and the success of
future operations may be sufficient to enable the Company to continue as a going concern
 however
 there can be no assurance that
the raising of equity will be successful. Failure to achieve the needed equity funding could have a material adverse effect on
the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board
of Directors
Curative
Biosciences
 Inc.
(Formerly
known as Amaize Beverage Corporation)
Los
Angeles
 California

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Curative Biosciences
 Inc.
 formerly Amaize Beverage Corporation as of June 30
2017 and the related statements of operations
 stockholders&rsquo; deficit and cash flows for the year then ended. Curative Biosciences&rsquo;
management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining
 on a test
basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
 assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion
 the financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of Curative
Biosciences
 Inc. as of June 30
 2017 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended
 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 3 to the financial statements
 the Company has suffered losses and has not yet established a reliable
 consistent and
proven source of revenue to meet its operating costs on an ongoing basis and currently does not have sufficient available funding
to fully implement its business plan. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
Management&rsquo;s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 Inc. (formerly Amaize Beverage Corporation)
NOTES
TO AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For
the years ended June 30
 2017 and 2016

Note
1. The Company

On
August 13
 2015
 Amaize Beverage Corporation
 previously known as SnackHealthy
 Inc.
 a Nevada corporation filed an amendment
to its articles of incorporation (the &ldquo;Amendment&rdquo;) with the Secretary of State of the state of Nevada. The Amendment
provided for the change of the Company&rsquo;s name from SnackHealthy
 Inc.
 to Amaize Beverage Corporation. The name change and
the change of the Company&rsquo;s trading symbol were subsequently declared effective by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(FINRA) as of August 19
 2015.

The
Board of Directors and the majority shareholders of the Company constituting a total of 9
180
143 shares of common stock (58.44%)
approved as of August 29
 2017
 in a written consent of the Board of Directors and the majority of the shareholders of the Company
as of the same date
 a name change from &ldquo;Amaize Beverage Corporation&rdquo; to &ldquo;Curative Biosciences
 Inc.&rdquo;
The Company believes that its new name will better reflect the new direction of the Company&rsquo;s business
 that of developing
and commercializing novel therapeutics using hemp-derived CBD. On October 6
 2017
 the Company filed an amendment to its articles
of incorporation (the &ldquo;Amendment&rdquo;) with the Secretary of State of the state of Nevada. The Amendment provided for
the change of the Company&rsquo;s name from Amaize Beverage Corporation to its current name
 Curative Biosciences
 Inc. The Company
submitted to FINRA an Issuer Company Related Action Notification for the name change and request for a new trading symbol and
is waiting to be declared effective by FINRA.

Basis
of Presentation

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America and are presented in US dollars. The Company&rsquo;s year-end is June 30.



The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
 the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.

Financial
Instruments

The
carrying value of the Company&rsquo;s financial instruments
 including cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 accrued
expenses
 accounts payable
 and amounts due to related parties
 as reported in the accompanying balance sheets
 approximates fair
value due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments.

y


Property
and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated life of the asset
 which is three
to seven years.

Website
Development Costs

The
Costs
incurred in the planning state of websites are expensed
 while costs incurred in the development stage are capitalized and amortized
over the estimated three-year life of the asset. All website development costs have been fully amortized at June 30
 2017.

Other
Assets

Our
drink license was amortized over three years and is fully amortized at June 30
 2017.


    
    



-Lived
Assets

In
accordance with ASC 350
 the Company regularly reviews the carrying value of intangible and other long-lived assets for the existence
of facts or circumstances
 both internally and externally
 that may suggest impairment. If impairment testing indicates a lack
of recoverability
 an impairment loss is recognized by the Company if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair
value.

Income
Taxes

The
Company accounts for income taxes under FASB Codification Topic 740-10-25 (&ldquo;ASC 740-10-25&rdquo;) Income Taxes. Under ASC
740-10-25
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740-10-25
 the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of
a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Revenue
Reco

Revenue
is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable
 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 products are shipped
which is when title and risk of loss pass to the customer and collectability of the amount is reasonably assured. Specifically
revenue is recognized when products are shipped
 which is when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The Company classifies
selling discounts and rebates
 if any
 as a reduction of revenue.

g


The
Company&rsquo;s policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company incurred no advertising expenses
during the years ended June 30
 2017 and 2016.

Stock-Based
                                         Compensation

We
account for stock based compensation pursuant to FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718

Compensation
 companies are required to measure the compensation costs
of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements
over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options
restricted share plans
 performance-based awards
 share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. As such
 compensation
cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value. Such compensation amounts
 if any
 are amortized over the respective
vesting periods of the option grant.

Equity
instruments (&ldquo;instruments&rdquo;) issued to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments
as required by FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718. FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 505

Payments to Non-Employees 
 the measurement
date is when either a (a) performance commitment
 as defined
 is reached or (b) the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance
is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period based
on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.

Basic
and Diluted Net Loss per Common Share

Net
loss per common share is computed pursuant to FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 260
. Basic
net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during
the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed in the same way as for basic net loss. There were no dilutive securities outstanding
as of June 30
 2017.


    
    





Certain
amounts previously presented for prior year have been reclassified. The reclassifications had no effect on net loss
 total assets
or stockholders&rsquo; deficit.

Recent
Accountin

The
Company has reviewed all recently issued
 but not yet effective
 accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption
of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.

Note
3. Goin

The
financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern which assumes the Company will be
able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company
incurred a net loss of $53
195 for the year ended June 30
 2017 and accumulated losses of $53
162
390 since inception to June
30
 2017. Cash used in operations for the year ended June 30
 2017 approximated $12
797 and as of June 30
 2017
 we had a working
capital deficit of $633
065. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the
Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company&rsquo;s ability to raise additional capital and implement
its business plan.

Management
believes that the actions presently being taken and the success of future operations will be sufficient to enable the Company
to continue as a going concern
 however
 there can be no assurance that the raising of equity will be successful or that the Company
will be able to achieve profitability. Failure to achieve the needed equity funding or establish profitable operations would have
a material adverse effect on the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Note

The
Company started the construction of several websites all of which have been completed and are being amortized over three years.
Computers and furniture are being depreciated over three to seven years.

5. Commitments and Contin

Lease
Commitments

The
Company has no current lease commitments. Our existing arrangement is month-to-month provided by an office center which is highly
cost effective and adequately satisfies our current requirements. The Company plans to seek leased or additional office space
when needed.

The
Company has not invested in
 nor do we own any real property at this time. The Company has no formal policy with respect to investments
in real estate or investments with persons primarily engaged in real estate activities.



In
June of 2013
 a former officer of the Company filed a lawsuit against the Company. As of March 31
 2015
 the Company had accrued
in full for this liability of $200
761 in its financial statements.

In
January 2014
 the Company terminated its Florida office space lease. A liability of $181
968 has been recorded in the Company&rsquo;s
financial statements for the early termination of the lease and remainder of the monthly lease payments through June 2016.


    
    



Note
6. Stockholders&rsquo; Deficit

The
Company has authorized 200
000
000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 and 25
000
000 shares of preferred stock
with a par value of $0.001.

During
the year ended June 30
 2016 the Company issued 3
683
039 shares of common stock valued at $1
438
483 for services rendered by
related parties
 112
500 shares of common for services valued at $112
500
 476
461 shares of common stock in payment of Directors&rsquo;
fees valued at $162
000 and 25
000 shares of common stock in payment of account payables to a related party of $25
000 resulting
in a non-cash loss on settlement of liabilities of $16
125.

During
the year ended June 30
 2017 the Company issued 150
000 shares of common stock valued at $37
500 to a related party for services
valued at $21
000 and accounts payable in the amount of $16
500.

ee
Stock Options and Warrants

The
Company accounts for non-employee stock options and warrants under ASC 718
 whereby option and warrant costs are recorded based
on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued
 whichever is more reliably
measurable. Unless otherwise provided for
 the Company covers option and warrant exercises by issuing new shares.

There
were no warrants or stock options issued or outstanding during the years ended June 30
 2017 or 2016. All warrants issued in prior
periods expired without being exercised.

Note
8. Loans from Directors and Shareholders

During
the year ended June 30
 2016 a related party advanced the Company loans in the amount of $20
506. During the year ended June 30
2017
 a related party advanced the Company loans in the amount of $12
797. As of June 30
 2017
 the balance of loans outstanding
was $62
825. The loans are non-interest bearing and due on demand.

Note
9. Income Taxes 

Deferred
taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences
are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced
by a valuation allowance when
 in the opinion of management
 it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates
on the date of enactment. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22
 2017 which reduced the U.S. corporate statutory
rate from 35% to 21% beginning on January 1
 2018. We used 25% as an effective rate.

Net
deferred tax liabilities consist of the following components as of June 30
 2017 and 2016:

The
income tax provision differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the U.S. Federal Income Tax Rate to pretax income
from continuing operations for the years ended June 30
 2017 and 2016 due to the following:

At
June 30
 2017
 the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $5
077
000.00 that may be offset against future
taxable income up through 2036. Filing of tax returns will have to be done to establish this amount and date. No tax benefits
have been reported in the June 30
 2017 consolidated financial statements since the potential tax benefit is offset by a valuation
allowance of the same amount. Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986
 net operating loss carryforwards
for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur
 net operating
loss carryforwards may be limited as to use in future years.

Reconciliation
of the differences between the statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate is as follows at June 30
 2017 and June 30
2016 respectively:

Note
10. Subsequent Events

The
Board of Directors and the majority shareholders of Amaize Beverage Corporation approved as of August 29
 2017
 in a written consent
of the Board of Directors and the majority of the shareholders as of the same date

Company&rsquo;s business which will focus on the research
 development
 and sale of high-quality
 hemp derived CBD products. The
Company&rsquo;s new web address is www.CurativeBio.com. Following the required regulatory approval and filing of the amended articles

866
665 shares of common stock for services valued at $290

ITEM
9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE



ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

A
system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-l5(e)) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934
as amended [the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;]) are controls and other procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance
that the information that the Company is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&rsquo;s rules and forms
 and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Company&rsquo;s management
 including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to the
effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures
 including the possibility of human error and the circumvention
or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly
 even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide
reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives
 and management necessarily is required to use its judgment in evaluating
the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition
 the design of any system of controls is based
in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
 and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed
in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Moreover
 over time
 controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions
 or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations
in a control system
 misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. The Company&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures for the Company
and have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report
 based on their evaluation of these controls and procedures
required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15 (f)
 due to certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting as discussed below.

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting

The
Company&rsquo;s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting
for the Company. Due to limited resources
 Management conducted an evaluation of internal controls based on criteria established
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&ldquo;COSO&rdquo;).
The results of this evaluation determined that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of June 30
 2017
due to material weaknesses. A material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is defined as a deficiency
 or a
combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such that there is a reasonable possibility that a
material misstatement of the Company&rsquo;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
that is less severe than a material weakness
 yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of our
financial reporting. Management&rsquo;s assessment identified the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial
reporting:



    
    
The
    small size of our Company limits our ability to achieve the desired level of separation of internal controls and financial
    reporting. We currently do not have independent directors on our Board of Directors to review and oversee the financial policies
    and procedures of the Company.

    
    
    

    
    
We
    do not have a functional audit committee since our Board of Directors acts as the audit committee.

    
    
    

    
    
We
    have not achieved the desired level of documentation of our internal controls and procedures. When the Company obtains sufficient
    funding
 this documentation will be strengthened through utilizing a third-party consulting firm to assist management with
    its internal control documentation and further help to limit the possibility of any lapse in controls occurring.


As
a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described above
 the Company&rsquo;s management
has concluded that
 as of June 30
 2017
 the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting was not effective based
on the criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. To date
 the Company has not been able to establish
an Audit Committee with an independent director due its limited financial resources. When the Company obtains sufficient funding
Management intends to add establish its Audit Committee and charge them with assisting the Company in addressing the material
weaknesses noted above. The Company&rsquo;s lack of current financial resources makes it impossible for the Company to hire the
appropriate personnel needed to overcome these weaknesses and ensure that appropriate controls and separation of responsibilities
of a larger organization exist. We also will continue to follow the standards for the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) for internal control over financial reporting to include procedures that:



    
    
Pertain
    to the maintenance of records in reasonable detail accurately that fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
    Company&rsquo;s assets;

    
    
    

    
    
Provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
    of management and the Board of Directors; and

    
    
    

    
    
Provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
 or disposition of the Company&rsquo;s
    assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



    
    



Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our
management determined that there were no changes made in our internal controls over financial reporting during the fiscal year
ended June 30
 2017 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial
reporting. This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company&rsquo;s registered public accounting firm
regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management&rsquo;s report was not subject to attestation by the Company&rsquo;s
registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide
only management&rsquo;s report in this annual report.

LIMITATION
ON DIRECTORS&rsquo; LIABILITIES

Our
certificate of incorporation limits
 to the maximum extent permitted under Nevada law
 the personal liability of directors and
officers for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duties as directors and officers
 except in circumstances involving
wrongful acts
 such as a breach of the director&rsquo;s duty of loyalty or acts of omission which involve intentional misconduct
or a knowing violation of law.

Nevada
Law permits us to indemnify officers
 directors or employees against expenses
 including attorney&rsquo;s fees
 judgments
 fines
and amounts paid in settlement in connection with legal proceedings if the officer
 director or employee acted in good faith and
in a manner in which they reasonably believed to be in
 or not opposed to
 our best interest
 and
 with respect to any criminal
act or proceeding
 they had no reasonable cause to believe their conduct was unlawful. Indemnification is not permitted as to
any matter as to which the person is adjudged to be liable unless
 and only to the extent that
 the court in which such action
or suit was brought upon application that
 despite the adjudication of liability
 but in view of all the circumstances of the
case
 the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court deems proper. Individuals who successfully
defend this type of action are entitled to indemnification against expenses reasonably incurred in connection therewith. Our by-laws
require us to indemnify directors and officers against
 to the fullest extent permitted by law
 liabilities which they may incur
under the circumstances described in the preceding paragraph.

 the Company&#13;regularly reviews the carrying value of intangible and other long-lived assets for the existence of facts or circumstances
 both&#13;internally and externally
 that may suggest impairment. If impairment testing indicates a lack of recoverability

 deferred tax assets and&#13;liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying&#13;amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using&#13;enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered&#13;or settled.

 &lt;i&gt;Compensation &amp;#8211; Stock Compensation&lt;/i&gt;. Under FASB Accounting&#13;Standards Codification No. 718
 companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements&#13;based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are&#13;required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options
 restricted share plans
 performance-based&#13;awards
 share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. As such
 compensation cost is measured on the date of grant&#13;at their fair value. Such compensation amounts

 as required by FASB Accounting Standards&#13;Codification No. 718. FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 505
 &lt;i&gt;Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees &lt;/i&gt;defines the&#13;measurement date and recognition period for such instruments. In general
 the measurement date is when either a (a) performance&#13;commitment

 a related party advanced&#13;the Company loans in the amount of $12

&#13;in the opinion of management
 it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.&#13;Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The&#13;Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22
 2017 which reduced the U.S. corporate statutory rate from 35% to 21% beginning&#13;on January 1

 the Company had net&#13;operating loss carryforwards of approximately $5

 2017&#13;consolidated financial statements since the potential tax benefit is offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount. Due to&#13;the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986
 net operating loss carryforwards for Federal income tax reporting&#13;purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur
