 following an event of default or a qualifying event
















 our greatest opportunities are in the functional food








 nutritional supplement retailers and direct sales companies.&#160; In August 2013
 we entered into a multi-year agreement to sell certain of our Stage II products to a rapidly growing direct marketing company.&#160; Pursuant to that agreement
 that company is obligated to purchase a minimum of $7.7 million in products during the term of the agreement which expires in December 2016.&#160; We will seek additional long-term supply agreements with similar companies in the future.&#160; As part of this strategy







 DRB
 RBO and derivatives are nutritional
 functional and beneficial food products that contain a unique combination of oil
 protein
 carbohydrates
 vitamins
 minerals
 fibers
 and antioxidants that enhance the nutritional value of popular consumer products.&#160; Foods that are ideally suited for the addition of our SRB and DRB to their products include processed meats
 cereals
 baked goods
 breading and batters.&#160; The inclusion of DRB in breading and batters can result in a reduction in oil uptake
 higher moisture retention
 improved nutritional profiles




 we received USDA/FSIS approval to market rice bran as an ingredient to be used as a filler in comminuted meat products
 such as meat and poultry sausages that contain binders
 nugget-shaped patties
 meatballs
 meatloaf
 and meat and poultry patties.&#160; Our products replace functional ingredients like soy protein isolate
 soy protein concentrate
 modified food starch
 pea protein and mustard flour at a significantly reduced cost.&#160; With strong application benefits such as reduced cost per unit
 increased product yield and reduced purge







 we also sell DRB as an ingredient for inclusion in a variety of feed formulations targeted to animal species such as horses
 beef cattle
 dairy cows

 Brazil and the United States rank 9th and 12th
 respectively
 in production of rice

 individual rice kernels are stored in common receiving locations such as farm silos for future delivery to grain dryers or area rice mills.&#160; At this stage
 large quantities of individual rice kernels are collectively called &#8220;paddy rice
&#8221; or &#8220;rough&#8221; rice.&#160; In this form
 the rice kernel is fully enveloped by the rice hull
 which serves as a protective cover




 if necessary
 paddy rice is cleaned of foreign material (scalping
 de-stoning and aspiration) just before it enters the first stage of milling
 or paddy husking.&#160; In the paddy husker
 the hull is removed from rough rice by differential speed rubber rollers.&#160; Loosened hulls are carried off by aspiration.&#160; After husking




 the outer brown layers of bran are removed from the inner white starch endosperm by an abrasive or frictional milling process which produces a milled
 white rice kernel.&#160; After milling
 white rice is typically sorted by size to remove broken pieces of rice kernels from whole kernels













 testa
 nucellus and aleurone) surrounding the white starchy endosperm.&#160; Commercial rice bran makes up approximately 10% of rough rice by weight.&#160; Rice germ
 an especially nutrient rich material




 the oils present in raw rice bran come into contact with native lipase enzymes that are naturally present in the rice kernel.&#160; These lipase enzymes initiate a rapid enzymatic hydrolysis of the oil
 converting oils (triglycerides) into monoglycerides
 diglycerides and free fatty acids (FFA).&#160; As the FFA content builds in raw rice bran
 the bran becomes unpalatable and off flavors (rancidity) develop.&#160; If left unchecked
 enzymatic degradation at normal room temperatures can increase the FFA levels to 5-8% within 24 hours and can continue at a rate of approximately 4-5% per day thereafter.&#160; Enzymatic degradation is the most serious form of degradation of raw rice bran.&#160; Rice bran stabilization is the process of carefully deactivating native enzymes to prevent the increase of FFA otherwise caused by lipase enzyme activity.&#160; Proper stabilization is critical in the preservation of the nutritional value of the bran




 including the use of chemicals
 microwave heating










 pressure and other conditions necessary to thoroughly deactivate enzymes without significantly damaging the structure or nutrient content of raw rice bran.&#160; This means that higher value compounds in bran
 such as oils




 on the premises of or in near proximity to any conventional rice mill so that freshly milled raw rice bran can be quickly delivered to our proprietary stabilizers.&#160; Process logic controllers maintain exact process conditions within the prescribed pressure/temperature regime.&#160; In case of power failure or interruption of the flow of fresh bran into the system








000 pounds of bran per hour and has a capacity of over 7
200 tons per year.&#160; Stabilization production capacity can be doubled
 tripled or further multiplied by installing additional units sharing a common conveyor and stage system
 which we believe can handle the output of the world&#8217;s largest rice mills.&#160; We have also developed and tested a smaller production unit
 with a maximum production capacity of 840 tons per year




 including proteins
 fibers
 lipids and micronutrients such as vitamins
 minerals and phytosterols
 among others.&#160; In these processes SRB or DRB

 raw rice bran is obtained from a number of rice mills and transported to a facility within which it is first stabilized via extrusion and then solvent extracted to produce crude RBO and DRB.&#160; Crude RBO is subsequently processed in a number of steps designed to sequentially capture constituents of value and to remove and discard impurities.&#160; The final outcome of these steps is a highly refined
 edible RBO that has superior flavor and functional properties.&#160; In addition
 the various co-products of crude RBO processing
 distilled fatty acids for example
 are refined and sold as products in their own right.&#160; DRB is finely ground and packaged for use as a versatile food ingredient in many applications.&#160; DRB may also be compounded with other ingredients such as a vegetable proteins
 carbohydrates




 except that the oil has been removed.&#160; This is important for several ingredient applications where SRB&#8217;s oil content could present food formulation challenges.&#160; By removing oil from SRB
 nutritionists have greater options to formulate DRB into breakfast bars
 low-calorie foods
 low-fat baking applications and batter and breading for frying applications.&#160; Additionally
 DRB is ideally suited for downstream enzymatic processing




 RBO becomes high quality cooking oil possessing beneficial high temperature frying characteristics.&#160; RBO has a unique fatty acid content that imparts improved oxidative stability as compared to other vegetable oils such as soy or cottonseed giving it advantages when used in food applications.&#160; The RBO extraction process utilized at our Brazilian facility uses a conventional solvent extraction process to separate oil from raw bran
 resulting in crude RBO available for sale to industrial markets or other processors.&#160; Additional refining processes done in Brazil can involve degumming
 neutralization
 bleaching















Emphasis on Natural

 the U.S. market for natural
 organic and functional foods grew in excess of 10% and exceeded $110 billion in 2014 making that category 15% of total U.S. food sales
 with natural and organic sub-sectors of that market growing 12% and 13% respectively &#8211; the fastest growing segments in the U.S. market for foods.&#160; These sales levels and growth rates are much higher than previously forecast confirming that the trend to healthy eating as part of an overall wellness regimen is not a fad.&#160; Our portfolio of functional ingredients includes rice bran extracts that demonstrate beneficial properties in areas of cardiovascular health
 weight management
 glucose balance
 inflammatory response and gastrointestinal health.&#160; Premium ingredient manufacturers are in high demand and we are strategically positioned to take advantage of this growing and sustainable market opportunity.&#160; We will continue marketing our proprietary and patented ingredients directly to formulators and co-packers who manufacture turnkey finished products for direct to consumer marketing companies (i.e.
 multi-level marketing (MLM)
 web
 radio
 retail) and to active ingredient distributors to reduce new product development cycles and drive sales of our functional ingredients.&#160; We believe that focusing our marketing efforts on distributors to reduce new product development cycles and drive sales of our functional ingredients.&#160; We believe that focusing our marketing efforts on distributors











Acquisition of formulating and packaging company that serves the Natural

 we expect to drive sales of our Stage II products into multiple natural
 organic and functional food channels allowing us to capture not only single ingredient sales but also sales of blended finished products consisting predominantly of our ingredients blended with other products and sold as a finished product on a business to business basis.&#160; In 2014 and 2015 we used capital raised from the market to double the capacity of HN.&#160; As a part of our strategy to grow our natural organic and functional food business
 we will continue to develop functional ingredients and packaged




















&#160; During 2014
 we doubled our capacity to produce certain Stage II products at our Dillon
 Montana facility in response to projected increased demand for natural
 organic and functional food products.&#160; We completed the expansion project near the end of 2014.&#160; We co-developed proprietary and provisionally patented technologies with DSM Innovation Center
 a subsidiary of Royal DSM N.V. that enables the extraction of protein from DRB and SRB.&#160; In early 2015 we launched new protein products from our U.S. operations and plan to produce protein from DRB in our Brazil segment in the future based on the technologies developed with DSM.&#160; In addition
 we entered into a series of agreements with various affiliates of Wilmar International limited (collectively
 Wilmar) to develop and commercialize rice bran products
 including protein











&#160; Our Brazil segment currently sells all of the rice bran oil it can produce in our oil extraction and bio-refining plant in Pelotas
 Brazil.&#160; Following the capital expansion project at this plant











Demand for minimally processed
 natural

 organic and functional foods is rapidly expanding in the U.S.
 Europe and other global markets with increasing demand for healthy
 natural and minimally processed ingredients that are hypoallergenic
 non-genetically modified and produced in a sustainable fashion. The regulatory need to add front-of-label warnings on food items is driving food companies to replace standard food ingredients like soy and wheat with &#8220;cleaner&#8221; ingredients such as rice bran which is non-allergenic
 non-genetically modified











The value of proprietary

 consumers are becoming more proactive in adopting and maintaining healthier lifestyles through exercise
 balanced nutrition and increased consumption of functional foods and nutraceuticals.&#160; Associated with this trend is higher demand by marketers of nutraceuticals and functional foods for novel functional ingredients and particularly for proprietary and patented ingredients that provide barriers to competition in the marketplace

 we formed Rice Science
 LLC (Rice Science)
 and a Delaware limited liability company
 with Herbal Science Singapore Pte. Ltd. (Herbal Science) to develop nutraceutical extracts and pharmaceutical chemistries from our SRB.&#160; Herbal Science utilized sophisticated methodologies in the identification and isolation of specific biologically active compounds that have been tested for effectiveness against specific disease conditions.&#160; In March 2011
 our partnership with Herbal Science ended with us acquiring the membership interest formerly owned by Herbal Science
 leaving Rice Science as our wholly owned subsidiary.&#160; We are hopeful that the research performed by Herbal Science will result in biologically active SRB extracts for use in the nutraceutical and functional food industry.In 2008
 Rice Science conducted research regarding the development of extracts from SRB that would be effective in addressing inflammation and pain.&#160; A number of SRB extracts have been tested with two identified as having significant in vitro activities.&#160; A blend of these two extracts was created to produce a third extract that exhibits a high level of in vitro inhibition of Cox 1

 selling all or substantially all of our assets or raising additional capital through equity or debt financings.&#160; Because of our recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations




 and losses in the future could cause the trading price of our stock to decline or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition




 we have incurred an accumulated deficit in excess of $250 million.&#160; We may not be able to achieve or maintain profitable operations if achieved.&#160; If our losses continue
 our liquidity may continue to be severely impaired
 our stock price may fall and our shareholders may lose all or a significant portion of their investment.&#160; If we are not able to attain profitability in the near future our financial condition could deteriorate further which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects and result in a significant or complete loss of your investment.&#160; Further
 we may be unable to pay our debt obligations as they become due



















 strengthen our financial position or to make acquisitions.&#160; Our board of directors has the ability
 without seeking shareholder approval
 to issue convertible debt and additional shares of common stock or preferred stock that is convertible into common stock for such consideration as the board of directors may consider sufficient
 which may be at a discount to the market price.&#160; Any sales of additional equity or convertible debt securities would result in dilution of the equity interests of our existing shareholders
 which could be substantial.&#160; Additionally
 if we issue shares of preferred stock or convertible debt to raise funds
 the holders of those securities might be entitled to various preferential rights over the holders of our common stock
 including repayment of their investment
 and possibly additional amounts
 before any payments could be made to holders of our common stock in connection with an acquisition of us.&#160; Such preferred shares
 if authorized
 might be granted rights and preferences that would be senior to
 or otherwise adversely affect
 the rights and the value of our common stock.&#160; Also








 or difficulties encountered in the implementation of such controls
 could harm our operating results
 cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements.&#160; Any such failure could
 in turn
 affect the future ability of our management to certify that internal control over our financial reporting is effective.&#160; Inferior internal control over financial reporting could also subject us to the scrutiny of the SEC and other regulatory bodies which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or shareholder litigation




 if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting
 the disclosure of that fact
 even if quickly remedied
 could reduce the market&#8217;s confidence in our financial statements and harm our share price.&#160; Furthermore
 deficiencies could result in future non-compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.&#160; Such non-compliance could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions











 our anticipated share of this market
 the estimated price and acceptance of our products and other factors.&#160; These assumptions are based on our best estimates
 however our assessments may not prove to be correct.&#160; Any future success may depend upon factors including changes in the dietary supplement industry
 governmental regulation
 increased levels of competition
 including the entry of additional competitors and increased success by existing competitors
 changes in general economic conditions
 increases in operating costs including costs of rice bran
 production
 supplies
 personnel
 equipment










 we expect to review opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies
 such as the acquisition of HN that was completed on January 2
 2014
 that would complement our current products
 expand the breadth of our markets or enhance technical capabilities
 or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities.&#160; Such acquisitions involve numerous risks

































































































































 we have an operation in Brazil which manufactures rice bran oil.&#160; There are risks in operating facilities in foreign countries because
 among other reasons
 we may be unable to attract sufficient qualified personnel
 intellectual property rights may not be enforced as we expect
 and legal rights may not be available as contemplated.&#160; Should any of these risks occur
 our ability to expand our foreign operations may be materially limited and we may be unable to maximize the output from these facilities and our financial results may decrease from our anticipated levels.&#160; The inherent risks of international operations could materially adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.&#160; The types of risks faced in connection with international operations and sales include




















































































































 political and other conditions
 and Brazilian government policies or actions in response to these conditions






 taxation
 credit
 tariff and other policies to influence the course of Brazil&#8217;s economy.&#160; For example
 the government&#8217;s actions to control inflation have at times involved setting wage and price controls
 blocking access to bank accounts
 imposing exchange controls and limiting imports into Brazil.&#160; In addition
 periodically there are disruptions related to national transportation strikes
 like those occurring in February 2015
 which may limit Irgovel&#8217;s ability to receive raw rice bran and ship products to customers.&#160; We have no control over

 Irgovel must meet certain minimum annual processing targets and must achieve EBITDA in the local currency of at least R$4.0 million.&#160;&#160; At the end of 2015
 Irgovel did not meet this covenant but Investors waived the requirement.&#160; If Irgovel fails to meet these financial requirements
 we could lose management control over Irgovel&#8217;s operations
 and management control would transfer to the other investors in Nutra SA.&#160; Any such change in management control would cause us to no longer consolidate Irgovel&#8217;s financial results with our financial results.&#160; Instead





















 we are subject to the risk of labor disputes
 strikes
 work stoppages and other labor-relations matters.&#160; Our collective bargaining agreement in Brazil has a one-year term and requires that we provide wage adjustments each year.&#160; We may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on similar or more favorable terms and may experience work stoppages or other labor problems in the future.&#160; We could experience a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs
 which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition
 potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers

 own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. Dollar
 including primarily the Brazilian Real.&#160; Currently
 a significant portion of our revenues and expenses occur in our Brazilian subsidiary
 Irgovel.&#160; Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars
 we must translate revenues
 income and expenses
 as well as assets and liabilities
 into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect historically
 during or at the end of each reporting period.&#160; Therefore
 increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the Brazilian Real and any other currency which affects a material amount of our operations
 will affect our revenues
 cost of sales
 gross profit (loss)
 operating expenses
 or other income and expenses and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies.&#160; These fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.&#160; Disruptions in financial markets may result in significant changes in foreign exchange rates in relatively short periods of time which further increases the risk of an adverse currency effect.&#160; Since we plan to expand our international operations
 we will likely increase our exposure to foreign currency risks.&#160; We do not hedge our currency risk

 the ultimate collection of the obligation from the customer may not occur.&#160; Although we continue to expand our customer base in an attempt to mitigate the concentration of credit risk
 the writing off of an accounts receivable balance could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.&#160; Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables.&#160; Historically

 Osmar Brito and the remaining former Irgovel stockholders (Sellers)
 requesting:&#160; (i) the freezing of the escrow account maintained in connection with the transfer of Irgovel&#8217;s corporate control to us and the presentation of all documentation related to the transaction
 and (ii) damages in the amount of the difference between (a) the sum received by David Resyng in connection with the judicial settlement agreement executed in the action for the partial dissolution of the limited liability company filed by David Resyng against Irgovel and the Sellers and (b) the amount received by the Sellers in connection with the sale of Irgovel&#8217;s corporate control to us

 we believe that the responsibility for any indemnity













 2009
 the Sellers filed a collection lawsuit against us seeking payment of the second installment of the purchase price under the Purchase Agreement

 only Irgovel has received formal legal notice.&#160; In addition

 the arbitration panel issued its opinion and ordered the Sellers to pay Irgovel and us R$3.6 million plus arbitration fees

 $2.0 million was deposited into an escrow account to cover contingencies with the net remaining funds payable to the Sellers upon resolution of all contingencies.&#160; As of December 31

 &#8211; Accounts receivable represent amounts receivable on trade accounts.&#160; The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable.&#160; We analyze the aging of customer accounts
 customer concentrations
 customer credit-worthiness
 current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.&#160; From period to period



Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value
 with cost determined by the first-in
 first-out method.&#160; In the USA segment
 we employ a full absorption procedure using standard cost techniques.&#160; The standards are customarily reviewed and adjusted annually so that they are materially consistent with actual purchase and production costs.&#160; In the Brazil segment we use actual average purchase and production costs.&#160; Provisions for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory are made based upon our analysis of inventory levels



Long-Lived Assets

 consisting primarily of property
 intangible assets
 and goodwill




 used to identify potential impairment
 compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount
 including goodwill.&#160; If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount
 goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired
 and
 thus
 the second step of the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary.&#160; If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value
 the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss




 we use level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy. The inputs used to calculate the fair value include a number of subjective factors
 such as estimates of future cash flows
 estimates of our future cost structure
 discount rates for our estimated cash flows
 required level of working capital
 assumed terminal value
 and time horizon of cash flow forecasts.&#160; Estimating the fair value of an individual reporting unit requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans













 which include intangible assets subject to amortization
 for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.&#160; An impairment loss is recognized when the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset to be held and used are not sufficient to recover the unamortized balance of the asset.&#160; An impairment loss is recognized based on the difference between the carrying values and estimated fair value.&#160; The estimated fair value is determined based on either the discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods with the amount of any such deficiency charged to operations in the current year.&#160; Estimates of future cash flows are based on many factors
 including current operating results
 expected market trends and competitive influences.&#160; We also evaluate the amortization periods assigned to its intangible assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value



 &#8211; We recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss pass to our customers
 generally upon shipment for USA segment customers and Brazil segment international customers and upon customer receipt for Brazil segment domestic customers.&#160; Each transaction is evaluated to determine if all of the following four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred; (iii) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.&#160; If any of the above criteria cannot be satisfied then such a transaction is not recorded as revenue




 discounts and price adjustments when they are reasonably estimable.&#160; Revenues on the statements of operations are net of provisions for estimated returns
 routine sales discounts






We have certain warrant agreements in effect that contain anti-dilution clauses.&#160; Under these clauses
 we may be required to lower the exercise price on these warrants and issue additional warrants based on future issuances of our common stock and awards of options to employees
 additional issuance of warrants and/or other convertible instruments below certain exercise prices.&#160; 


Share-based compensation expense for employees is calculated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model based on awards ultimately expected to vest
 reduced for estimated forfeitures
 and expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period of the grant.&#160; Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on our historical forfeiture experience and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.&#160; The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model requires us to estimate key assumptions such as expected life
 volatility
 risk-free interest rates and dividend yield to determine the fair value of share-based awards



We account for share-based compensation awards granted to non-employees and consultants by determining the fair value of the awards granted at either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued

 it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached or (ii) the date at which the counterparty's performance is complete.&#160; The expense associated with stock awards issued to consultants or other third parties are recognized over the term of service.&#160; In the event services are terminated early or we require no specific future performance
 the entire amount is expensed.&#160; 


 &#8211; We account for income taxes by recording a deferred tax asset or liability for the recognition of future deductible or taxable amounts and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.&#160; Deferred tax expense or benefit is recognized as a result of timing differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes during the year.&#160; Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.&#160; Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.&#160; A valuation allowance is established
 when necessary














 &#8211; The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.&#160; Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates






























We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of RiceBran Technologies (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31
 2015 and 2014
 and the related consolidated statements of operations

 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining
 on a test basis

NOTE 1. LIQUIDITY
 MANAGEMENT PLANS AND GENERAL BUSINESS






 we continued to experience losses and negative cash flows from operations which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.&#160; We believe that we will be able to obtain additional funds to operate our business
 should it be necessary
 however



In January 2014
 we completed the acquisition of Healthy Natural
 Inc. (HN)

Irgovel)

&#160;completed the final stages of a major capital expansion during the first quarter of 2015.&#160; Throughout 2014

 we invested $3.6 million and $10.3 million in Nutra SA

 such that Irgovel should continue to improve its gross profit margins in 2016 subject to raw bran availability.&#160; However
 there are no assurances that this will occur.


In May 2015
 we entered into an $8 million senior secured credit facility agreement with a lender (the Lender) consisting of a $3.5 million revolving loan
 not to exceed a borrowing base
 as defined in the agreement
 and an initial $2.5 million term loan
 which term loan may be increased at the Lender&#8217;s discretion by up to $2.0 million within 2 years.&#160; In February 2016
1
 2016 through March 30
 2016
 we have invested an additional $1.0 million in Nutra SA to fund Irgovel working capital needs.&#160;&#160; As of March 30
 2016
 we may make additional investments in Nutra SA up to $0.5 million without prior approval of the Lender.

 &#8211; The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities



 &#8211; The consolidated financial statements are presented in our reporting currency
 U.S. Dollars.&#160; The functional currency for Irgovel is the Brazilian Real.&#160; Assets and liabilities of Irgovel are translated into U.S. Dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the consolidated balance sheet date.&#160; Equity accounts are translated at historical rates
 except for the change in accumulated deficit during the year
 which is the result of the income statement translation process.&#160; Irgovel&#8217;s revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates in effect during the period.&#160; Translation differences are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as foreign currency translation.&#160; Gains or losses on transactions denominated in a currency other than Irgovel&#8217;s functional currency which arise as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates are recorded as foreign exchange gain or loss in the statements of operations. As of March 30
 2016
 the Brazilian Real has fallen against the U.S. Dollar since December 31
 2015
 by approximately 16%.&#160; The Brazilian Real exchange rate to the U.S. Dollar at December 31
 2013 was 0.4228

 2014 it was 0.3758 and at December 31



 &#8211; We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.&#160; As of December 31

 when necessary
 to reduce that deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.&#160; The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in Brazil.&#160; Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties
 the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that may be different from current estimates of the tax liabilities.&#160; If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment
 an additional charge to expense would result.&#160; If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts



 &#8211; The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.&#160; Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates










 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers
 to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and develop a common revenue standard for GAAP and IFRS.&#160; Under the new guidance
 an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services













 the FASB issued guidance which makes targeted amendments to current consolidation guidance.&#160; Among other things




 the FASB issued guidance which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset.&#160; We elected to early adopt these provisions effective October 1
 2015
 retrospectively for all periods presented.&#160; As a result
 $0.5 million of debt issuance costs as of December 31
 2015
 are presented as a deduction of the related debt in these financial statements.&#160; There were no debt issuance costs included in our statement of financial statements as of December 31




 the FASB issued an amendment which changes the measurement principle for inventory to the lower of cost and net realizable value.&#160; Entities are no longer to consider replacement cost or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin when measuring inventory. We elected to early adopt these provisions prospectively effective October 1




 the FASB issued amendments which change the balance sheet classification of deferred income taxes.&#160; Previous standards required us to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in our statements of financial position.&#160; The amendments require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in our consolidated statements of financial position.&#160; As a result
 each jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability.&#160; We elected to early adopt these provisions effective October 1
 2015
 retrospectively to all periods presented.&#160; As a result
 a $171 thousand deferred tax asset previously classified as current as of December 31
 2014
 is classified as noncurrent



In February 2016
 the FASB issued amendments which change the accounting for leases.&#160; As under prior GAAP
 the recognition
 measurement
 and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease for us as a lessee depend primarily on its classification as a finance or operating lease.&#160; For capital or finance leases
 lessees will recognize amortization of the right-of-use asset separately from interest on the lease liability.&#160; For operating leases

 lessees will recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.&#160;

 we entered into an $8 million senior secured credit facility agreement with a lender (the Lender) consisting of a $3.5 million revolving loan
 not to exceed a borrowing base
 as defined in the agreement
 and an initial $2.5 million term loan
 which term loan may be increased at the Lender&#8217;s discretion by up to $2.0 million within 2 years.&#160; The funds will be used for general corporate purposes and to provide working capital to facilitate future growth.&#160; The facility is secured by a senior interest in substantially all of our assets
 excluding half of our interest in Nutra SA and RBT PRO
 LLC.&#160; The credit facility matures on June 1
 2018
 with the potential for two one-year maturity extensions.&#160; The loan bears interest at a variable interest rate based on LIBOR
 with a 0.75% floor and 1.25% cap
 plus 10.75% per annum
 (11.5% at December 31
 a warrant to purchase 300
000 shares of common stock (exercise price of $5.25
 May 2020 expiration) to the Lender.&#160; As of December 31
 2015
 the fair value of the warrant is $0.3 million. As of December 31
 2015
 the remaining unamortized discount on the term note is $0.6 million.&#160; As of December 31
 2015
 the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the term note was $0.5 million.&#160; We accrete the term note up to its face value at an effective interest rate of 27.5% per year




 we entered into an agreement with the Lender which modified the financial convents to require that (a) from February 1
 2016 to July 15
 2016
 we maintain cash on hand
 including availability under our revolving loan with the Lender
 of not less than $1.5 million provided that at least $0.8 million of such amount must be in the form of cash on hand
 and (b) we maintain an average monthly adjusted EBITDA
 as defined by the agreement
 calculated over each consecutive three-month period beginning on January 1
&#160; February 1
 March 1
 April 1 and May 1
 2016
 of not less than $0.1 million.&#160; The Lender also waived
 for the first two quarters of 2016
 any non-compliance with the financial covenants in the May 2015 agreement.&#160; The amendment with the Lender requires that we repay $1.0 million of the senior term note which occurred on March 24
 2016.&#160; In consideration for the amendments







 the terms of subordinated notes in the principal amount of $6.3 million were amended to extend the maturity dates from July 2016 to May 2018 and change the interest rate from 5% per year to an annual interest rate of a rate determined as a function of LIBOR (as defined in the amendment) plus 11% (currently 11.75%) (the Note Amendment).&#160; Interest is payable quarterly.&#160; Principal is payable in seven quarterly installments of $0.3 million beginning in October 2016
 with the remainder of principal due in May 2018.&#160; The holders of these notes received warrants to acquire 289
670 shares of common stock in the aggregate (exercise price of $5.25
 May 2020 expiration).&#160; We accounted for the amendment as an extinguishment and reissuance.&#160; We recognized a $1.9 million loss on extinguishment equal to the total of (i) the difference between the $5.1 million carrying value of the notes on the date of the transaction and the $6.3 million face value of the notes and (ii) the $0.7 million fair value of the warrants at issuance.&#160; These notes are secured by a subordinated interest in substantially all of our assets
 excluding our interest in Nutra SA and RBT PRO




 payable quarterly
 and mature in July 2016.&#160; We accrete these notes up to their face value at an effective interest rate of 24.5%.&#160; As of December 31
 2015
 the remaining unamortized debt discount related to these notes was less than $0.1 million.&#160; These notes are secured by a subordinated interest in substantially all of our assets
 excluding our interest in Nutra SA and RBT PRO
























 Irgovel entered into loan agreements with the Bank of Brazil.&#160; As of December 31

 we believe that the responsibility for any indemnity

 the Sellers filed a collection lawsuit against us seeking payment of the second installment of the purchase price under the Purchase Agreement
 which the Sellers assert is approximately $1.0 million.&#160; We have withheld payment of the second installment pending resolution of the Resyng lawsuit noted above.&#160; Our parent company has not been served with any formal notices in regard to this matter.&#160; To date
 only Irgovel has received formal legal notice.&#160; In addition



As part of the Purchase Agreement

 2016
 the US District Court for the District of Arizona entered a final judgment in our favor for a total of $1.9 million plus interest.&#160; On March 24

 our ownership percentage in Nutra SA reducecd .85%. in March 2016 when we received the escrow funds



 2015 and 2014
 totaling $1.9 million.&#160; When the escrow account was funded
 we established an accrued liability equal to the amount of the escrow for contingencies and the net balance due to the Sellers under the terms of the Purchase Agreement.&#160; As of December 31

 $0.3 million of pre-acquisition contingencies had either been paid or specifically identified and accrued

 we purchased all of the outstanding shares of HN for $2.0 million in cash ($1.8 million paid in January 2014 and $0.2 million payable upon the resolution of certain contingencies) and promissory notes in the face amount of $3.3 million
 subject to working capital adjustments.&amp;#160; HN is an Irving

 internet sales and retail distribution markets.&amp;#160; HN serves the natural products
 nutritional supplement and nutraceutical and functional food sectors.&amp;#160; We acquired HN as part of our strategy to vertically integrate our business in order to leverage our proprietary and patented technologies.&amp;#160; The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination.&amp;#160; The results of HN&amp;#8217;s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning January 2

 we incurred $0.3 million of acquisition-related costs which are included in selling

 the consideration transferred to acquire HN
 as well as the amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value as of the January 2

 we periodically enter into employment agreements which incorporate indemnification provisions.&amp;#160; While the maximum amount to which we may be exposed under such agreements cannot be reasonably estimated
 we maintain insurance coverage

 2015

 from time to time we are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business.&amp;#160; When applicable
 we record accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.&amp;#160; While the outcome of lawsuits and other proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty
 in the opinion of management
 individually or in the aggregate

 2008
 former Irgovel stockholder David Resyng filed an indemnification suit against Irgovel
 Osmar Brito and the remaining former Irgovel stockholders (Sellers)
 requesting:&amp;#160; (i) the freezing of the escrow account maintained in connection with the transfer of Irgovel&amp;#8217;s corporate control to us and the presentation of all documentation related to the transaction
 and (ii) damages in the amount of the difference between (a) the sum received by David Resyng in connection with the judicial settlement agreement executed in the action for the partial dissolution of the limited liability company filed by David Resyng against Irgovel and the Sellers and (b) the amount received by the Sellers in connection with the sale of Irgovel&amp;#8217;s corporate control to us
 in addition to moral damages as determined in the court&amp;#8217;s discretion.&amp;#160; The amount of damage claimed by Mr. Resyng is approximately $3.0 million.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;We believe that the filing of the above lawsuit is a fundamental default of the obligations undertaken by the Sellers under the quotas purchase agreement for the transfer of Irgovel&amp;#8217;s corporate control
 executed by and among the Sellers and us on January 31
 2008 (Purchase Agreement).&amp;#160; Consequently
 we believe that the responsibility for any indemnity
 costs and expenses incurred or that may come to be incurred by Irgovel and/or us in connection with the above lawsuit is the sole responsibility of the Sellers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify; background-color: #ffffff;&gt;On February 6
 2009
 the Sellers filed a collection lawsuit against us seeking payment of the second installment of the purchase price under the Purchase Agreement
 which the Sellers assert is approximately $1.0 million.&amp;#160; We have withheld payment of the second installment pending resolution of the Resyng lawsuit noted above.&amp;#160; Our parent company has not been served with any formal notices in regard to this matter.&amp;#160; To date
 only Irgovel has received formal legal notice.&amp;#160; In addition

 $2.0 million was deposited into an escrow account to cover contingencies with the net remaining funds payable to the Sellers upon resolution of all contingencies.&amp;#160; As of December 31
 2015
 the balance in the escrow account was $1.9 million and is included in restricted cash in our balance sheets.&amp;#160; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';&gt;On January 12
 2016
 the US District Court for the District of Arizona entered a final judgment in our favor for a total of $1.9 million plus interest.&amp;#160; On March 24
 2016
 the $1.9 million in the escrow account was released to us to fund the award owed to us by the Sellers and
 as required under an agreement with the Lender

 our ownership percentage in Nutra SA reducecd .85%. in March 2016 when we received the escrow funds&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;There is an escrow liability related to the lawsuit in accrued expenses on our balance sheets as of December 31
 2015 and 2014
 totaling $1.9 million.&amp;#160; When the escrow account was funded
 we established an accrued liability equal to the amount of the escrow for contingencies and the net balance due to the Sellers under the terms of the Purchase Agreement.&amp;#160; As of December 31
 2015
 $0.3 million of pre-acquisition contingencies had either been paid or specifically identified and accrued
 leaving a balance of $1.7 million to settle any remaining contingencies.&amp;#160; We believe as of March 24
 2016
 now that the escrow funds have been released to us

 Irgovel is required to meet minimum annual processing targets or to achieve EBITDA on a local currency base of at least R$4.0 million annually. If not achieved
 this would result in an event of default.&amp;#160; It is possible that an event of default may be triggered and a waiver of non-compliance may not be obtained from the Investors. At December 31

 we entered into an $8 million senior secured credit facility agreement with a lender (the Lender) consisting of a $3.5 million revolving loan
 not to exceed a borrowing base
 as defined in the agreement
 and an initial $2.5 million term loan
 which term loan may be increased at the Lender&amp;#8217;s discretion by up to $2.0 million within 2 years.&amp;#160; The funds will be used for general corporate purposes and to provide working capital to facilitate future growth.&amp;#160; The facility is secured by a senior interest in substantially all of our assets
 excluding half of our interest in Nutra SA and RBT PRO
 LLC.&amp;#160; The credit facility matures on June 1
 2018
 with the potential for two one-year maturity extensions.&amp;#160; The loan bears interest at a variable interest rate based on LIBOR
 with a 0.75% floor and 1.25% cap
 plus 10.75% per annum
 (11.5% at December 31

000 shares of common stock (exercise price of $5.25
 May 2020 expiration) to the Lender.&amp;#160; As of December 31
 2015
 the fair value of the warrant is $0.3 million. As of December 31
 2015
 the remaining unamortized discount on the term note is $0.6 million.&amp;#160; As of December 31
 2015
 the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the term note was $0.5 million.&amp;#160; We accrete the term note up to its face value at an effective interest rate of 27.5% per year
 30.5% including amortization of debt issuance costs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: justify;&gt;The May 2015 agreement with the Lender included certain financial and non-financial covenants such as a requirement that we maintain $2.0 million of total liquidity at all times which is defined as $1.0 million in cash on hand and $1.0 million of available borrowings.&amp;#160; In February 2016
 we entered into an agreement with the Lender which modified the financial convents to require that (a) from February 1
 2016 to July 15
 2016
 we maintain cash on hand
 including availability under our revolving loan with the Lender
 of not less than $1.5 million provided that at least $0.8 million of such amount must be in the form of cash on hand
 and (b) we maintain an average monthly adjusted EBITDA
 as defined by the agreement
 calculated over each consecutive three-month period beginning on January 1
&amp;#160; February 1
 March 1
 April 1 and May 1
 2016
 of not less than $0.1 million.&amp;#160; The Lender also waived
 for the first two quarters of 2016
 any non-compliance with the financial covenants in the May 2015 agreement.&amp;#160; The amendment with the Lender requires that we repay $1.0 million of the senior term note which occurred on March 24
 2016.&amp;#160; In consideration for the amendments

 the terms of subordinated notes in the principal amount of $6.3 million were amended to extend the maturity dates from July 2016 to May 2018 and change the interest rate from 5% per year to an annual interest rate of a rate determined as a function of LIBOR (as defined in the amendment) plus 11% (currently 11.75%) (the Note Amendment).&amp;#160; Interest is payable quarterly.&amp;#160; Principal is payable in seven quarterly installments of $0.3 million beginning in October 2016
 with the remainder of principal due in May 2018.&amp;#160; The holders of these notes received warrants to acquire 289
670 shares of common stock in the aggregate (exercise price of $5.25
 May 2020 expiration).&amp;#160; We accounted for the amendment as an extinguishment and reissuance.&amp;#160; We recognized a $1.9 million loss on extinguishment equal to the total of (i) the difference between the $5.1 million carrying value of the notes on the date of the transaction and the $6.3 million face value of the notes and (ii) the $0.7 million fair value of the warrants at issuance.&amp;#160; These notes are secured by a subordinated interest in substantially all of our assets
 excluding our interest in Nutra SA and RBT PRO
 LLC.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: justify;&gt;The terms of subordinate notes in the principal amount of $0.2 million were not modified in May 2015.&amp;#160; These notes bear an interest rate of 5% per year
 payable quarterly
 and mature in July 2016.&amp;#160; We accrete these notes up to their face value at an effective interest rate of 24.5%.&amp;#160; As of December 31
 2015
 the remaining unamortized debt discount related to these notes was less than $0.1 million.&amp;#160; These notes are secured by a subordinated interest in substantially all of our assets
 excluding our interest in Nutra SA and RBT PRO


 Irgovel entered into loan agreements with the Bank of Brazil.&amp;#160; As of December 31
 2015
 the remaining notes held a principal balance of R$8.2 million. The annual interest rate on the loans is 6.5%
 payable quarterly and the loans mature December 2021.&amp;#160; Irgovel must make monthly principal payments under each of the loans.&amp;#160; In July 2012

 depending on the agreement.&amp;#160; The annual interest rates on this debt range from 8.4% to 135.6%


 which was 14.3% at December 31

 we calculated the net present value of Brazil segment estimated cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate

 to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows.&amp;#160; While the quantitative analysis indicated no impairment of Brazil segment goodwill existed as of December 31
 2015
 if the future performance of that reporting unit falls short of our expectations or if there are significant changes in risk-adjusted discount rates due to changes in market conditions

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers
 to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and develop a common revenue standard for GAAP and IFRS.&amp;#160; Under the new guidance
 an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services

 the FASB issued guidance which makes targeted amendments to current consolidation guidance.&amp;#160; Among other things
 the standard changes the manner in which we would assess one of the characteristics of variable interest entities (VIEs) and introduces a separate analysis specific to limited partnerships and similar entities (such as Nutra SA) for assessing if the equity holders at risk lack decision making.&amp;#160; Limited partnerships and similar entities will be a VIE unless the limited partners hold substantive kick-out rights or participating rights.&amp;#160; A right to liquidate an entity is akin to a kick-out right.&amp;#160; Guidance for limited partnerships under the voting model has been eliminated.&amp;#160; A limited partner and similar partners with a controlling financial interest obtained through substantive kick-out rights would consolidate a limited partnership or similar entity. The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2016.&amp;#160; Early adoption is allowed.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The Company is in the process of determining the&amp;#160;impact the new guidance will have on our results of operations and financial position and&amp;#160;will determine if we will adopt the standard on a full or modified retrospective basis.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: justify;&gt;In April 2015
 the FASB issued guidance which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset.&amp;#160; We elected to early adopt these provisions effective October 1
 2015
 retrospectively for all periods presented.&amp;#160; As a result
 $0.5 million of debt issuance costs as of December 31
 2015
 are presented as a deduction of the related debt in these financial statements.&amp;#160; There were no debt issuance costs included in our statement of financial statements as of December 31
 2014.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: justify;&gt;In July 2015
 the FASB issued an amendment which changes the measurement principle for inventory to the lower of cost and net realizable value.&amp;#160; Entities are no longer to consider replacement cost or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin when measuring inventory. We elected to early adopt these provisions prospectively effective October 1
 2015.&amp;#160; Adoption had no impact on our results of operations.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: justify;&gt;In November 2015
 the FASB issued amendments which change the balance sheet classification of deferred income taxes.&amp;#160; Previous standards required us to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in our statements of financial position.&amp;#160; The amendments require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in our consolidated statements of financial position.&amp;#160; As a result
 each jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability.&amp;#160; We elected to early adopt these provisions effective October 1
 2015
 retrospectively to all periods presented.&amp;#160; As a result
 a $171 thousand deferred tax asset previously classified as current as of December 31
 2014
 is classified as noncurrent

 the FASB issued amendments which change the accounting for leases.&amp;#160; As under prior GAAP
 the recognition
 measurement
 and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease for us as a lessee depend primarily on its classification as a finance or operating lease.&amp;#160; For capital or finance leases
 lessees will recognize amortization of the right-of-use asset separately from interest on the lease liability.&amp;#160; For operating leases
 lessees will recognize a single total lease expense.&amp;#160; &lt;/font&gt;For both types of leases

 we entered into a note payable with Mr. Halpern in the principal amount of $0.3 million and issued Mr. Halpern warrants to acquire 25

 we purchased all of the outstanding shares of HN for $2.0 million in cash
 plus convertible promissory notes for $3.3 million.&amp;#160; Mark McKnight
 our current senior vice president of sales
 and his wife collectively owned a majority interest in HN prior to the acquisition.&amp;#160; In connection with our acquisition of HN
 Mark McKnight received $0.7 million in cash and a convertible promissory note for $1.4 million and Nicole McKnight
 his wife
 received $0.7 million in cash and a convertible promissory note for $1.4 million.&amp;#160; We had the option to pay principal and accrued interest under the notes in either cash or in our common stock
 however
 if we issued shares to certain former warrants holders upon an increase in authorized shares we were required to settle any outstanding balance on the notes through the issuance of shares of our common stock.&amp;#160; On May 30
 2014
 we issued 225
925 shares of common stock to settle Mark McKnight&amp;#8217;s note and 225
925 shares of common stock to settle Nicole McKnight&amp;#8217;s note.&amp;#160; The notes were converted at a conversion price of $6.00 per share.&amp;#160; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;In January 2014

 we continued to experience losses and negative cash flows from operations which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.&amp;#160; We believe that we will be able to obtain additional funds to operate our business
 should it be necessary
 however

 we completed the acquisition of Healthy Natural
 Inc. (HN)
 the operations of which are accretive to cash flows.&amp;#160; &lt;/font&gt;The Brazil segment consists of the consolidated operations of Nutra S.A. LLC (Nutra SA)
 whose only operating subsidiary is &lt;font style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;&gt;Industria Riograndens De Oleos Vegetais Ltda. (&lt;/font&gt;Irgovel)

 Brazil.&amp;#160; &lt;font style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;&gt;Irgovel
&amp;#160;completed the final stages of a major capital expansion during the first quarter of 2015.&amp;#160; Throughout 2014
 significant cash was used during the shutdown period and subsequent restart of the plant.&amp;#160; &lt;/font&gt;In 2015 and 2014
 we invested $3.6 million and $10.3 million in Nutra SA
 to fund Irgovel working capital needs. &lt;font style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;&gt;Operations at Irgovel began to improve during the end of 2015
 such that Irgovel should continue to improve its gross profit margins in 2016 subject to raw bran availability.&amp;#160; However

 we entered into an $8 million senior secured credit facility agreement with a lender (the Lender) consisting of a $3.5 million revolving loan
 not to exceed a borrowing base
 as defined in the agreement
 and an initial $2.5 million term loan
 which term loan may be increased at the Lender&amp;#8217;s discretion by up to $2.0 million within 2 years.&amp;#160; In February 2016

 2016 through March 30
 2016
 we have invested an additional $1.0 million in Nutra SA to fund Irgovel working capital needs.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; As of March 30
 2016
 we may make additional investments in Nutra SA up to $0.5 million without prior approval of the Lender.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: justify;&gt;In March 2016

 several co-products are obtained.&amp;#160; One such product is distilled fatty acids
 a valuable raw material for the detergent industry.&amp;#160; Irgovel also produces rice lecithin
 which has application in human nutrition
 animal nutrition and industrial applications.&amp;#160; DRB is compounded with a number of other ingredients to produce complex animal nutrition products which are packaged and sold under Irgovel brands in the Brazilian market

 and accumulated interest thereon
 converted into 543
894 shares of common stock upon our issuance of shares to certain former warrant holders.&amp;#160; The notes converted in May 2014.&amp;#160; Upon conversion
 we recognized a $0.9 million loss on extinguishment for the difference between the fair value of the shares issued ($3.9 million) and the carrying amount of the notes ($2.4 million) and related conversion feature ($0.6 million).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: justify;&gt;The convertible notes issued in the March 2014 and May 2014 private placement closings

 the shares are subject to a voting agreement

 volatility
 risk-free interest rates and dividend yield to determine the fair value of share-based awards

 whichever is more reliably measured.&amp;#160; Generally we value options granted to non-employees and consultants using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model.&amp;#160; &lt;/font&gt;If the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used
 it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached or (ii) the date at which the counterparty's performance is complete.&amp;#160; The expense associated with stock awards issued to consultants or other third parties are recognized over the term of service.&amp;#160; In the event services are terminated early or we require no specific future performance

 U.S. Dollars.&amp;#160; The functional currency for Irgovel is the Brazilian Real.&amp;#160; Assets and liabilities of Irgovel are translated into U.S. Dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the consolidated balance sheet date.&amp;#160; Equity accounts are translated at historical rates
 except for the change in accumulated deficit during the year
 which is the result of the income statement translation process.&amp;#160; Irgovel&amp;#8217;s revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates in effect during the period.&amp;#160; Translation differences are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as foreign currency translation.&amp;#160; Gains or losses on transactions denominated in a currency other than Irgovel&amp;#8217;s functional currency which arise as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates are recorded as foreign exchange gain or loss in the statements of operations. As of March 30
 2016
 the Brazilian Real has fallen against the U.S. Dollar since December 31
 2015
 by approximately 16%.&amp;#160; The Brazilian Real exchange rate to the U.S. Dollar at December 31
 2013 was 0.4228
 at December 31
 2014 it was 0.3758 and at December 31

 2015
 we maintained our cash
 including restricted cash
 and cash equivalents

 customer concentrations
 customer credit-worthiness
 current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.&amp;#160; From period to period

 with cost determined by the first-in
 first-out method.&amp;#160; In the USA segment
 we employ a full absorption procedure using standard cost techniques.&amp;#160; The standards are customarily reviewed and adjusted annually so that they are materially consistent with actual purchase and production costs.&amp;#160; In the Brazil segment we use actual average purchase and production costs.&amp;#160; Provisions for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory are made based upon our analysis of inventory levels

 Intangible Assets and Goodwill&lt;/font&gt; &amp;#8211; Long-lived assets
 consisting primarily of property
 intangible assets
 and goodwill
 comprise a significant portion of our total assets.&amp;#160; Property is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.&amp;#160; Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives.&amp;#160; Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred while renewals and betterments are capitalized.&amp;#160; Gains or losses on the sale of property and equipment are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.&amp;#160; Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and are amortized over their useful life on a straight-line or accelerated basis.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: justify;&gt;We test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.&amp;#160; Our annual qualitative or quantitative assessments involve determining an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units in order to evaluate whether an impairment of the current carrying amount of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets exists.&amp;#160; A qualitative assessment evaluates whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit&amp;#8217;s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.&amp;#160; The first step of a quantitative goodwill impairment test
 used to identify potential impairment
 compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount
 including goodwill.&amp;#160; If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount
 goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired
 and
 thus
 the second step of the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary.&amp;#160; If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value
 the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss
 if any.&amp;#160; Fair values are derived based on an evaluation of past and expected future performance of our reporting units.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: justify;&gt;When we perform a quantitative estimate of fair value
 we use level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy. The inputs used to calculate the fair value include a number of subjective factors
 such as estimates of future cash flows
 estimates of our future cost structure
 discount rates for our estimated cash flows
 required level of working capital

 which include intangible assets subject to amortization
 for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.&amp;#160; An impairment loss is recognized when the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset to be held and used are not sufficient to recover the unamortized balance of the asset.&amp;#160; An impairment loss is recognized based on the difference between the carrying values and estimated fair value.&amp;#160; The estimated fair value is determined based on either the discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods with the amount of any such deficiency charged to operations in the current year.&amp;#160; Estimates of future cash flows are based on many factors
 including current operating results
 expected market trends and competitive influences.&amp;#160; We also evaluate the amortization periods assigned to its intangible assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value

 generally upon shipment for USA segment customers and Brazil segment international customers and upon customer receipt for Brazil segment domestic customers.&amp;#160; Each transaction is evaluated to determine if all of the following four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred; (iii) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.&amp;#160; If any of the above criteria cannot be satisfied then such a transaction is not recorded as revenue
 or is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized only when the sales cycle is complete and payment is either received or becomes reasonably assured.&amp;#160; Changes in judgments and estimates regarding the application of the above mentioned four criteria might result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized by such transactions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: justify;&gt;We make provisions for estimated returns
 discounts and price adjustments when they are reasonably estimable.&amp;#160; Revenues on the statements of operations are net of provisions for estimated returns
 routine sales discounts

 we may be required to lower the exercise price on these warrants and issue additional warrants based on future issuances of our common stock and awards of options to employees

 reduced for estimated forfeitures
 and expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period of the grant.&amp;#160; Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on our historical forfeiture experience and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.&amp;#160; The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model requires us to estimate key assumptions such as expected life
 volatility
 risk-free interest rates and dividend yield to determine the fair value of share-based awards

 whichever is more reliably measured.&amp;#160; Generally we value options granted to non-employees and consultants using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model.&amp;#160; &lt;/font&gt;If the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used
 it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached or (ii) the date at which the counterparty's performance is complete.&amp;#160; The expense associated with stock awards issued to consultants or other third parties are recognized over the term of service.&amp;#160; In the event services are terminated early or we require no specific future performance

 when necessary
 to reduce that deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.&amp;#160; The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in Brazil.&amp;#160; Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties
 the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that may be different from current estimates of the tax liabilities.&amp;#160; If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment
 an additional charge to expense would result.&amp;#160; If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts


 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers
 to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and develop a common revenue standard for GAAP and IFRS.&amp;#160; Under the new guidance
 an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services

 the FASB issued guidance which makes targeted amendments to current consolidation guidance.&amp;#160; Among other things
 the standard changes the manner in which we would assess one of the characteristics of variable interest entities (VIEs) and introduces a separate analysis specific to limited partnerships and similar entities (such as Nutra SA) for assessing if the equity holders at risk lack decision making.&amp;#160; Limited partnerships and similar entities will be a VIE unless the limited partners hold substantive kick-out rights or participating rights.&amp;#160; A right to liquidate an entity is akin to a kick-out right.&amp;#160; Guidance for limited partnerships under the voting model has been eliminated.&amp;#160; A limited partner and similar partners with a controlling financial interest obtained through substantive kick-out rights would consolidate a limited partnership or similar entity. The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2016.&amp;#160; Early adoption is allowed.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The Company is in the process of determining the&amp;#160;impact the new guidance will have on our results of operations and financial position and&amp;#160;will determine if we will adopt the standard on a full or modified retrospective basis.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: justify;&gt;In April 2015
 the FASB issued guidance which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset.&amp;#160; We elected to early adopt these provisions effective October 1
 2015
 retrospectively for all periods presented.&amp;#160; As a result
 $0.5 million of debt issuance costs as of December 31
 2015
 are presented as a deduction of the related debt in these financial statements.&amp;#160; There were no debt issuance costs included in our statement of financial statements as of December 31
 2014.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: justify;&gt;In July 2015
 the FASB issued an amendment which changes the measurement principle for inventory to the lower of cost and net realizable value.&amp;#160; Entities are no longer to consider replacement cost or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin when measuring inventory. We elected to early adopt these provisions prospectively effective October 1
 2015.&amp;#160; Adoption had no impact on our results of operations.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: justify;&gt;In November 2015
 the FASB issued amendments which change the balance sheet classification of deferred income taxes.&amp;#160; Previous standards required us to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in our statements of financial position.&amp;#160; The amendments require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in our consolidated statements of financial position.&amp;#160; As a result
 each jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability.&amp;#160; We elected to early adopt these provisions effective October 1
 2015
 retrospectively to all periods presented.&amp;#160; As a result
 a $171 thousand deferred tax asset previously classified as current as of December 31
 2014
 is classified as noncurrent

 the FASB issued amendments which change the accounting for leases.&amp;#160; As under prior GAAP
 the recognition
 measurement
 and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease for us as a lessee depend primarily on its classification as a finance or operating lease.&amp;#160; For capital or finance leases
 lessees will recognize amortization of the right-of-use asset separately from interest on the lease liability.&amp;#160; For operating leases
 lessees will recognize a single total lease expense.&amp;#160; &lt;/font&gt;For both types of leases

 Goodwill and Intangible Assets


 Intangible Assets and Goodwill&lt;/font&gt; &amp;#8211; Long-lived assets
 consisting primarily of property
 intangible assets
 and goodwill
 comprise a significant portion of our total assets.&amp;#160; Property is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.&amp;#160; Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives.&amp;#160; Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred while renewals and betterments are capitalized.&amp;#160; Gains or losses on the sale of property and equipment are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.&amp;#160; Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and are amortized over their useful life on a straight-line or accelerated basis.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: justify;&gt;We test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.&amp;#160; Our annual qualitative or quantitative assessments involve determining an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units in order to evaluate whether an impairment of the current carrying amount of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets exists.&amp;#160; A qualitative assessment evaluates whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit&amp;#8217;s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.&amp;#160; The first step of a quantitative goodwill impairment test
 used to identify potential impairment
 compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount
 including goodwill.&amp;#160; If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount
 goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired
 and
 thus
 the second step of the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary.&amp;#160; If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value
 the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss
 if any.&amp;#160; Fair values are derived based on an evaluation of past and expected future performance of our reporting units.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: justify;&gt;When we perform a quantitative estimate of fair value
 we use level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy. The inputs used to calculate the fair value include a number of subjective factors
 such as estimates of future cash flows
 estimates of our future cost structure
 discount rates for our estimated cash flows
 required level of working capital
 assumed terminal value
 and time horizon of cash flow forecasts.&amp;#160; Estimating the fair value of an individual reporting unit requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans
 industry and economic conditions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: justify;&gt;We review our long-lived assets

LIQUIDITY
 MANAGEMENT PLANS AND GENERAL BUSINESS [Abstract]




LIQUIDITY
 MANAGEMENT PLANS AND GENERAL BUSINESS
NOTE 1. LIQUIDITY
In 2014 and 2015
 we continued to experience losses and negative cash flows from operations which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.&#160; We believe that we will be able to obtain additional funds to operate our business
 should it be necessary
 however
In January 2014
 we completed the acquisition of Healthy Natural
 Inc. (HN)

Irgovel)
 located in Pelotas

&#160;completed the final stages of a major capital expansion during the first quarter of 2015.&#160; Throughout 2014

 we invested $3.6 million and $10.3 million in Nutra SA

 such that Irgovel should continue to improve its gross profit margins in 2016 subject to raw bran availability.&#160; However
In May 2015
 we entered into an $8 million senior secured credit facility agreement with a lender (the Lender) consisting of a $3.5 million revolving loan
 not to exceed a borrowing base
 as defined in the agreement
 and an initial $2.5 million term loan
 which term loan may be increased at the Lender&#8217;s discretion by up to $2.0 million within 2 years.&#160; In February 2016
1
 2016 through March 30
 2016
 we have invested an additional $1.0 million in Nutra SA to fund Irgovel working capital needs.&#160;&#160; As of March 30
 2016
In March 2016
We are a human food ingredient
 nutritional supplement and animal nutrition company focused on value-added processing and marketing of healthy
 natural and nutrient dense products derived from raw rice bran an underutilized by-product of the rice milling industry.&#160; Using our bio-refining business model
 we apply our proprietary and patented technologies and intellectual properties to convert raw rice bran into numerous high value products including stabilized rice bran (SRB)
 rice bran oil (RBO)
 defatted rice bran (DRB)

 a complete rice bran nutritional package derived from further processing of SRB; RiSolubles
 a highly nutritious
 carbohydrate and lipid rich fraction of RiBalance; RiFiber
 a fiber rich insoluble derivative of RiBalance
 and ProRyza
 rice bran protein-based products

 functional food
 nutraceutical supplement and animal nutrition manufacturers
 wholesalers and retailers
We have two reportable operating segments: (i) USA segment
 which manufactures and distributes SRB (for human food ingredient and animal nutrition customers) in various granulations along with Stage II products and derivatives and (ii) Brazil segment
 which extracts crude RBO and DRB from rice bran
 which are then further processed into fully refined rice bran oil for sale internationally and in Brazil
 compounded animal nutrition products for horses
 cows
 swine


 which include costs related to our corporate staff
 general and administrative expenses including public company expenses
 intellectual property
 professional fees
 and other expenses.&#160; No corporate allocations
 including interest
The combined operations of our USA and Brazil segments encompass our bio-refining approach to processing raw rice bran into various high quality
 value-added constituents and finished products.&#160; Over the past decade
 we have developed and optimized our proprietary bio-refining processes to support the production of healthy
 natural
 hypoallergenic
 gluten free
 and non-genetically modified ingredients and supplements for use in human meats
 baked goods
 cereals
 coatings
 health foods
 nutritional supplements
The USA segment produces SRB inside two supplier rice mills in California and our facility in Mermentau

 Louisiana has been idle since May 2009.&#160; The USA segment also includes our Dillon

 a complete rice bran nutritional package derived from further processing of SRB; RiSolubles
 a highly nutritious
 carbohydrate and lipid rich fraction of RiBalance; RiFiber
 a fiber rich insoluble derivative of RiBalance
 and ProRyza
 rice bran protein-based products

The Brazil segment consists of the consolidated operations of Nutra SA
 whose only operating subsidiary is Irgovel
 located in Pelotas
 Brazil.&#160; Irgovel manufactures RBO and DRB products for both the human ingredient and animal nutrition markets in Brazil and internationally.&#160; In refining RBO to an edible grade
 several co-products are obtained.&#160; One such product is distilled fatty acids
 a valuable raw material for the detergent industry.&#160; Irgovel also produces rice lecithin
 which has application in human nutrition
 animal nutrition and industrial applications.&#160; DRB is compounded with a number of other ingredients to produce complex animal nutrition products which are packaged and sold under Irgovel brands in the Brazilian market
 sold as a raw material for further processing into human food ingredients or sold in bulk into the animal nutrition markets in Brazil and neighboring countries.&#160; In 2015
 approximately 52% of Brazil segment product revenue was from sales of RBO products and the remainder was from sales of DRB products.

 &#8211; The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities
 &#8211; The consolidated financial statements are presented in our reporting currency
 U.S. Dollars.&#160; The functional currency for Irgovel is the Brazilian Real.&#160; Assets and liabilities of Irgovel are translated into U.S. Dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the consolidated balance sheet date.&#160; Equity accounts are translated at historical rates
 except for the change in accumulated deficit during the year
 which is the result of the income statement translation process.&#160; Irgovel&#8217;s revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates in effect during the period.&#160; Translation differences are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as foreign currency translation.&#160; Gains or losses on transactions denominated in a currency other than Irgovel&#8217;s functional currency which arise as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates are recorded as foreign exchange gain or loss in the statements of operations. As of March 30
 2016
 the Brazilian Real has fallen against the U.S. Dollar since December 31
 2015
 by approximately 16%.&#160; The Brazilian Real exchange rate to the U.S. Dollar at December 31
 2013 was 0.4228
 at December 31
 2014 it was 0.3758 and at December 31
 &#8211; We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.&#160; As of December 31
 2015
 we maintained our cash
 including restricted cash
 and cash equivalents
 &#8211; Accounts receivable represent amounts receivable on trade accounts.&#160; The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable.&#160; We analyze the aging of customer accounts
 customer concentrations
 customer credit-worthiness
 current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.&#160; From period to period
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value
 with cost determined by the first-in
 first-out method.&#160; In the USA segment
 we employ a full absorption procedure using standard cost techniques.&#160; The standards are customarily reviewed and adjusted annually so that they are materially consistent with actual purchase and production costs.&#160; In the Brazil segment we use actual average purchase and production costs.&#160; Provisions for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory are made based upon our analysis of inventory levels
Long-Lived Assets

 consisting primarily of property
 intangible assets
 and goodwill
We test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.&#160; Our annual qualitative or quantitative assessments involve determining an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units in order to evaluate whether an impairment of the current carrying amount of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets exists.&#160; A qualitative assessment evaluates whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit&#8217;s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.&#160; The first step of a quantitative goodwill impairment test
 used to identify potential impairment
 compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount
 including goodwill.&#160; If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount
 goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired
 and
 thus
 the second step of the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary.&#160; If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value
 the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss
When we perform a quantitative estimate of fair value
 we use level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy. The inputs used to calculate the fair value include a number of subjective factors
 such as estimates of future cash flows
 estimates of our future cost structure
 discount rates for our estimated cash flows
 required level of working capital
 assumed terminal value
 and time horizon of cash flow forecasts.&#160; Estimating the fair value of an individual reporting unit requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans
We review our long-lived assets
 which include intangible assets subject to amortization
 for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.&#160; An impairment loss is recognized when the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset to be held and used are not sufficient to recover the unamortized balance of the asset.&#160; An impairment loss is recognized based on the difference between the carrying values and estimated fair value.&#160; The estimated fair value is determined based on either the discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods with the amount of any such deficiency charged to operations in the current year.&#160; Estimates of future cash flows are based on many factors
 including current operating results
 expected market trends and competitive influences.&#160; We also evaluate the amortization periods assigned to its intangible assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value
 &#8211; We recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss pass to our customers
 generally upon shipment for USA segment customers and Brazil segment international customers and upon customer receipt for Brazil segment domestic customers.&#160; Each transaction is evaluated to determine if all of the following four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred; (iii) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.&#160; If any of the above criteria cannot be satisfied then such a transaction is not recorded as revenue
We make provisions for estimated returns
 discounts and price adjustments when they are reasonably estimable.&#160; Revenues on the statements of operations are net of provisions for estimated returns
 routine sales discounts
We have certain warrant agreements in effect that contain anti-dilution clauses.&#160; Under these clauses
 we may be required to lower the exercise price on these warrants and issue additional warrants based on future issuances of our common stock and awards of options to employees
Share-based compensation expense for employees is calculated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model based on awards ultimately expected to vest
 reduced for estimated forfeitures
 and expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period of the grant.&#160; Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on our historical forfeiture experience and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.&#160; The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model requires us to estimate key assumptions such as expected life
 volatility
 risk-free interest rates and dividend yield to determine the fair value of share-based awards
We account for share-based compensation awards granted to non-employees and consultants by determining the fair value of the awards granted at either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued

 it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached or (ii) the date at which the counterparty's performance is complete.&#160; The expense associated with stock awards issued to consultants or other third parties are recognized over the term of service.&#160; In the event services are terminated early or we require no specific future performance
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.&#160; Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.&#160; A valuation allowance is established
 when necessary
 to reduce that deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.&#160; The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in Brazil.&#160; Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties
 the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that may be different from current estimates of the tax liabilities.&#160; If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment
 an additional charge to expense would result.&#160; If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts
 &#8211; The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.&#160; Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates
In May 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers
 to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and develop a common revenue standard for GAAP and IFRS.&#160; Under the new guidance
 an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services
In February 2015
 the FASB issued guidance which makes targeted amendments to current consolidation guidance.&#160; Among other things
In April 2015
 the FASB issued guidance which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset.&#160; We elected to early adopt these provisions effective October 1
 2015
 retrospectively for all periods presented.&#160; As a result
 $0.5 million of debt issuance costs as of December 31
 2015
 are presented as a deduction of the related debt in these financial statements.&#160; There were no debt issuance costs included in our statement of financial statements as of December 31
In July 2015
 the FASB issued an amendment which changes the measurement principle for inventory to the lower of cost and net realizable value.&#160; Entities are no longer to consider replacement cost or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin when measuring inventory. We elected to early adopt these provisions prospectively effective October 1
In November 2015
 the FASB issued amendments which change the balance sheet classification of deferred income taxes.&#160; Previous standards required us to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in our statements of financial position.&#160; The amendments require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in our consolidated statements of financial position.&#160; As a result
 each jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability.&#160; We elected to early adopt these provisions effective October 1
 2015
 retrospectively to all periods presented.&#160; As a result
 a $171 thousand deferred tax asset previously classified as current as of December 31
 2014
 is classified as noncurrent
In February 2016
 the FASB issued amendments which change the accounting for leases.&#160; As under prior GAAP
 the recognition
 measurement
 and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease for us as a lessee depend primarily on its classification as a finance or operating lease.&#160; For capital or finance leases
 lessees will recognize amortization of the right-of-use asset separately from interest on the lease liability.&#160; For operating leases

 lessees will recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.&#160;

We performed a quantitative analysis of our Brazil segment goodwill as of December 31
 2015.&#160; With the assistance of a valuation specialist
 we calculated the net present value of Brazil segment estimated cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate
 in order to estimate the fair value of that reporting unit from the perspective of a market participant.&#160; We used discount rates and terminal growth rates of approximately 24% and 5%
 respectively
 to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows.&#160; While the quantitative analysis indicated no impairment of Brazil segment goodwill existed as of December 31
 2015
 if the future performance of that reporting unit falls short of our expectations or if there are significant changes in risk-adjusted discount rates due to changes in market conditions
 we could be required to recognize material impairment charges in future periods.

In May 2015
 we entered into an $8 million senior secured credit facility agreement with a lender (the Lender) consisting of a $3.5 million revolving loan
 not to exceed a borrowing base
 as defined in the agreement
 and an initial $2.5 million term loan
 which term loan may be increased at the Lender&#8217;s discretion by up to $2.0 million within 2 years.&#160; The funds will be used for general corporate purposes and to provide working capital to facilitate future growth.&#160; The facility is secured by a senior interest in substantially all of our assets
 excluding half of our interest in Nutra SA and RBT PRO
 LLC.&#160; The credit facility matures on June 1
 2018
 with the potential for two one-year maturity extensions.&#160; The loan bears interest at a variable interest rate based on LIBOR
 with a 0.75% floor and 1.25% cap
 plus 10.75% per annum
 (11.5% at December 31
 a warrant to purchase 300
000 shares of common stock (exercise price of $5.25
 May 2020 expiration) to the Lender.&#160; As of December 31
 2015
 the fair value of the warrant is $0.3 million. As of December 31
 2015
 the remaining unamortized discount on the term note is $0.6 million.&#160; As of December 31
 2015
 the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the term note was $0.5 million.&#160; We accrete the term note up to its face value at an effective interest rate of 27.5% per year
The May 2015 agreement with the Lender included certain financial and non-financial covenants such as a requirement that we maintain $2.0 million of total liquidity at all times which is defined as $1.0 million in cash on hand and $1.0 million of available borrowings.&#160; In February 2016
 we entered into an agreement with the Lender which modified the financial convents to require that (a) from February 1
 2016 to July 15
 2016
 we maintain cash on hand
 including availability under our revolving loan with the Lender
 of not less than $1.5 million provided that at least $0.8 million of such amount must be in the form of cash on hand
 and (b) we maintain an average monthly adjusted EBITDA
 as defined by the agreement
 calculated over each consecutive three-month period beginning on January 1
&#160; February 1
 March 1
 April 1 and May 1
 2016
 of not less than $0.1 million.&#160; The Lender also waived
 for the first two quarters of 2016
 any non-compliance with the financial covenants in the May 2015 agreement.&#160; The amendment with the Lender requires that we repay $1.0 million of the senior term note which occurred on March 24
 2016.&#160; In consideration for the amendments
In May 2015
 the terms of subordinated notes in the principal amount of $6.3 million were amended to extend the maturity dates from July 2016 to May 2018 and change the interest rate from 5% per year to an annual interest rate of a rate determined as a function of LIBOR (as defined in the amendment) plus 11% (currently 11.75%) (the Note Amendment).&#160; Interest is payable quarterly.&#160; Principal is payable in seven quarterly installments of $0.3 million beginning in October 2016
 with the remainder of principal due in May 2018.&#160; The holders of these notes received warrants to acquire 289
670 shares of common stock in the aggregate (exercise price of $5.25
 May 2020 expiration).&#160; We accounted for the amendment as an extinguishment and reissuance.&#160; We recognized a $1.9 million loss on extinguishment equal to the total of (i) the difference between the $5.1 million carrying value of the notes on the date of the transaction and the $6.3 million face value of the notes and (ii) the $0.7 million fair value of the warrants at issuance.&#160; These notes are secured by a subordinated interest in substantially all of our assets
 excluding our interest in Nutra SA and RBT PRO
The terms of subordinate notes in the principal amount of $0.2 million were not modified in May 2015.&#160; These notes bear an interest rate of 5% per year
 payable quarterly
 and mature in July 2016.&#160; We accrete these notes up to their face value at an effective interest rate of 24.5%.&#160; As of December 31
 2015
 the remaining unamortized debt discount related to these notes was less than $0.1 million.&#160; These notes are secured by a subordinated interest in substantially all of our assets
 excluding our interest in Nutra SA and RBT PRO
All Brazil segment debt is denominated in the Brazilian Real (R$)
In December 2011
 Irgovel entered into loan agreements with the Bank of Brazil.&#160; As of December 31
 2015
 the remaining notes held a principal balance of R$8.2 million. The annual interest rate on the loans is 6.5%
 payable quarterly and the loans mature December 2021.&#160; Irgovel must make monthly principal payments under each of the loans.&#160; In July 2012
Irgovel has working capital lines of credit secured by accounts receivable.&#160; The total amount of borrowing cannot exceed 40%-100% of the collateral
 depending on the agreement.&#160; The annual interest rates on this debt range from 8.4% to 135.6%
Irgovel obtains advances against certain customer export orders from various banks.&#160; The annual interest rates on these advances range from 5.5% to 13.0%
Irgovel has an unsecured note payable for Brazilian federal and social security taxes under special Brazilian government tax programs.&#160; Principal and interest payments are due monthly through January 2029.&#160; Interest on the notes is payable monthly at the Brazilian SELIC target rate
 which was 14.3% at December 31
As of December 31
 2015
 we are in compliance with the provisions and covenants associated with our debt agreements
 as modified and discussed above.

000
000 shares of our common stock at the holder&#8217;s election at any time
 subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations
 at a ratio of 1 preferred share for 666.66666 shares of common stock.&#160; The preferred stock is only entitled to receive dividends if we declare dividends
 in which case the dividend will be paid (i) first an amount equal to $0.01 per share of preferred stock and (ii) then to and in the same form as dividends paid on shares of our common stock.&#160; Otherwise
In May 2014
 our shareholders approved an increase in our authorized shares of common stock from 6

In January 2014
 an underwriter exercised its overallotment rights related to our December 2013 secondary public offering.&#160; We issued and sold 162
586 shares of common stock for $5.24 per share and publicly traded warrants to purchase 162
586 shares of common stock ($6.55 per share exercise price and December 2018 expiration) for $0.01 per underlying share.&#160; In connection with the overallotment exercise
 the underwriters for the offering also received a warrant for the purchase of 8
130 shares of common stock (exercise price of $6.55 per share and December 2018 expiration).&#160; The net proceeds from the overallotment exercise were $0.8 million
 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other cash offering expenses of $0.1 million
We completed the first closing of a private placement offering in March 2014.&#160; We issued convertible notes in the principal amount of $4.9 million and warrants for the purchase of up to 1
399
614 shares of common stock ($5.25 per share exercise price and March 2019 expiration).&#160; We contributed $1.0 million of the $4.3 million proceeds
 net of $0.6 million of costs
 to Nutra SA
 and used the remainder of the proceeds for capital projects in the United States and for general corporate purposes.&#160; On a fully diluted basis
 at issuance we had available shares of common stock for 15.8% of the shares underlying the warrants.&#160; To the extent there were available shares
 we allocated proceeds to equity for the warrants ($0.4 million).&#160; We recorded a derivative liability for the warrants to the extent there were not available shares ($5.0 million).&#160; We recorded $1.1 million in financing expense at closing representing the excess of the amounts recorded for the warrants over the net proceeds from the offering.&#160; The convertible notes issued in the offering were initially recorded with a discount equal to the face amount of the notes.&#160; As discussed below
 in the Debt Conversions section
We completed the second closing of the private placement offering in May 2014.&#160; We issued convertible notes in the principal amount of $1.2 million and warrants for the purchase of up to 357
075 shares of common stock
 with an exercise price of $5.25 per share and a May 2019 expiration.&#160; We contributed $0.5 million of the $1.1 million proceeds
 net of $0.2 million of costs
 to Nutra SA
 and used the remainder of the proceeds for capital projects in the United States and for general corporate purposes.&#160; On a fully diluted basis
 at issuance we had no available shares of common stock for the shares underlying these warrants and
 as a result
 recorded a derivative liability for the fair value of these warrants at issuance ($2.0 million).&#160; We recorded $1.0 million in financing expense at closing
 representing the excess of the amounts recorded for the warrants over the net proceeds from the offering.&#160; The convertible notes issued in the offering were initially recorded with a discount equal to the face amount of the notes.&#160; As discussed below

 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated cash offering expenses of $0.4 million.&#160; As a result of this offering
 we were required under our warrants that contain full ratchet anti-dilution provisions to reduce the exercise price on certain warrants from $5.24 per share to $1.50 per share and to increase the number of shares of common stock underlying these warrants from 426
489 shares to 1

Shares of available common stock increased in 2014 as a result of (i) the expiration of certain outstanding warrants and options and (ii) the 19
000

 during the second quarter of 2014
 we transferred to equity the $8.9 million fair value of warrants previously classified as derivative liabilities solely due to a lack
 on a fully-diluted basis
In February 2016
 we issued 950
The shares are being held in escrow until earned (as defined in our agreement) by the supplier at a fixed price of $2.80 per share.&#160; While in escrow
 the shares are subject to a voting agreement
 pursuant to which the escrowed shares will be voted
 or not voted
 to match the vote of our other outstanding common stock on a pro rata percentage basis
 in order to ensure no shareholder votes are impacted.
 we agreed to issue former warrant holders and a note holder 1

Deferred taxes arise from temporary differences in the recognition of certain expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes.&#160; We have determined it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.&#160; Accordingly we have provided a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.&#160; Our valuation allowance is on U.S. and Brazil deferred tax assets.&#160; The change in valuation allowance of $2.0 million in 2015 was due to (i) $2.3 million in net operating loss and (ii) $0.1 million for the change in the valuation allowance against Brazil deferred tax assets
 net of $1.6 million impact from foreign currency translation
 offset by (i) the $0.1 million impact of net operating losses expiring and those being limited due to ownership changes (ii) $0.3 million of adjustments to stock compensation deferreds and other items.&#160; The change in valuation allowance of $47.1 million in 2014 was due to (i) $2.5 million in net operating loss and (ii) $3.0 million for the change in the valuation allowance against Brazil deferred tax assets
 net of $0.6 million impact from foreign currency translation
 offset by (i) the $41.8 million impact of net operating losses expiring and those being limited due to ownership changes (ii) $0.9 million from the impact of state rate changes (iii) $1.3 million from the establishment of deferred tax liabilities in the acquisition of HN (iv) $1.1 million of adjustments to intangibles and stock compensation deferreds
As of December 31
 2015
 net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal tax purposes totaled $10.0 million and expire at various dates from 2018 through 2035.&#160; Net operating loss carryforwards for state tax purposes totaled $13.6 million as of December 31
 2015
 and expire at various dates from 2016 through 2035.&#160; As of December 31
 2015
Due to offerings and conversions occurring between December 2013 and May 2014
 we believe our ability to utilize previously accumulated net operating loss carryforwards are subject to substantial annual limitations due to &#8220;change in ownership&#8221; provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended
 and similar state regulations.&#160; Therefore in 2014
 we recorded the impact of the expiration of substantial net operating loss carryforwards prior to utilization.&#160; We have not yet completed a formal analysis to determine the exact amount of such limitation
 therefore
We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various states.&#160; We record liabilities for income tax contingencies based on our best estimate of the underlying exposures.&#160; We are open for audit by the IRS for years after 2012 and

In the normal course of business
 we periodically enter into employment agreements which incorporate indemnification provisions.&#160; While the maximum amount to which we may be exposed under such agreements cannot be reasonably estimated
 we maintain insurance coverage
We lease certain properties under various operating lease arrangements that expire over the next twenty one years.&#160; These leases generally provide us with the option to renew the lease at the end of the lease term.&#160; Future minimum payments under these commitments as of December 31
 2015
In addition to the matters discussed below
 from time to time we are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business.&#160; When applicable
 we record accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.&#160; While the outcome of lawsuits and other proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty
 in the opinion of management
 individually or in the aggregate
On August 28
 2008
 former Irgovel stockholder David Resyng filed an indemnification suit against Irgovel
 Osmar Brito and the remaining former Irgovel stockholders (Sellers)
 requesting:&#160; (i) the freezing of the escrow account maintained in connection with the transfer of Irgovel&#8217;s corporate control to us and the presentation of all documentation related to the transaction
 and (ii) damages in the amount of the difference between (a) the sum received by David Resyng in connection with the judicial settlement agreement executed in the action for the partial dissolution of the limited liability company filed by David Resyng against Irgovel and the Sellers and (b) the amount received by the Sellers in connection with the sale of Irgovel&#8217;s corporate control to us
We believe that the filing of the above lawsuit is a fundamental default of the obligations undertaken by the Sellers under the quotas purchase agreement for the transfer of Irgovel&#8217;s corporate control
 executed by and among the Sellers and us on January 31
 2008 (Purchase Agreement).&#160; Consequently
 we believe that the responsibility for any indemnity
On February 6
 2009
 the Sellers filed a collection lawsuit against us seeking payment of the second installment of the purchase price under the Purchase Agreement
 which the Sellers assert is approximately $1.0 million.&#160; We have withheld payment of the second installment pending resolution of the Resyng lawsuit noted above.&#160; Our parent company has not been served with any formal notices in regard to this matter.&#160; To date
 only Irgovel has received formal legal notice.&#160; In addition
As part of the Purchase Agreement
 $2.0 million was deposited into an escrow account to cover contingencies with the net remaining funds payable to the Sellers upon resolution of all contingencies.&#160; As of December 31
 2015
On January 12
 2016
 the US District Court for the District of Arizona entered a final judgment in our favor for a total of $1.9 million plus interest.&#160; On March 24
 2016
 the $1.9 million in the escrow account was released to us to fund the award owed to us by the Sellers and
 as required under an agreement with the Lender
treat 90% of the funds retained from the escrow release as a distribution from Nutra SA and reduce our ownership percentage accordingly.&#160; As a result
There is an escrow liability related to the lawsuit in accrued expenses on our balance sheets as of December 31
 2015 and 2014
 totaling $1.9 million.&#160; When the escrow account was funded
 we established an accrued liability equal to the amount of the escrow for contingencies and the net balance due to the Sellers under the terms of the Purchase Agreement.&#160; As of December 31
 2015
 $0.3 million of pre-acquisition contingencies had either been paid or specifically identified and accrued
 leaving a balance of $1.7 million to settle any remaining contingencies.&#160; We believe as of March 24
 2016
 now that the escrow funds have been released to us
As further described in Note 5
 Irgovel is required to meet minimum annual processing targets or to achieve EBITDA on a local currency base of at least R$4.0 million annually. If not achieved
 this would result in an event of default.&#160; It is possible that an event of default may be triggered and a waiver of non-compliance may not be obtained from the Investors. At December 31
 2015
 Irgovel did not meet this covenant but Investors waived the requirement.

446 shares of common stock in the aggregate (exercise price of $5.25
 May 2020 expiration).&#160; In 2015 and 2014
 we paid and expensed less than $10 thousand of interest on subordinated notes beneficially owned by Mr. Short.
 Mr. Short for the purchase of up to 3
806 shares of common stock were cancelled in exchange for 12
777 shares of our common stock.&#160; The shares were not required to be issued until after our shareholders approved an increase in our authorized shares of common stock

In January 2014
 we purchased all of the outstanding shares of HN for $2.0 million in cash
 plus convertible promissory notes for $3.3 million.&#160; Mark McKnight
 our current senior vice president of sales
 and his wife collectively owned a majority interest in HN prior to the acquisition.&#160; In connection with our acquisition of HN
 Mark McKnight received $0.7 million in cash and a convertible promissory note for $1.4 million and Nicole McKnight
 his wife
 received $0.7 million in cash and a convertible promissory note for $1.4 million.&#160; We had the option to pay principal and accrued interest under the notes in either cash or in our common stock
 however
 if we issued shares to certain former warrants holders upon an increase in authorized shares we were required to settle any outstanding balance on the notes through the issuance of shares of our common stock.&#160; On May 30

 &#8211; The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities
 disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses.&#160; Actual results may differ from those estimates.&#160; The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of RiceBran Technologies and all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest.&#160; Variable interest in subsidiaries for which we are the primary beneficiary are consolidated.&#160; All significant inter-company accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.&#160; Noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries are recorded net of tax as net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.




 &#8211; The consolidated financial statements are presented in our reporting currency
 U.S. Dollars.&#160; The functional currency for Irgovel is the Brazilian Real.&#160; Assets and liabilities of Irgovel are translated into U.S. Dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the consolidated balance sheet date.&#160; Equity accounts are translated at historical rates
 except for the change in accumulated deficit during the year
 which is the result of the income statement translation process.&#160; Irgovel&#8217;s revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates in effect during the period.&#160; Translation differences are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as foreign currency translation.&#160; Gains or losses on transactions denominated in a currency other than Irgovel&#8217;s functional currency which arise as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates are recorded as foreign exchange gain or loss in the statements of operations. As of March 30
 2016
 the Brazilian Real has fallen against the U.S. Dollar since December 31
 2015
 by approximately 16%.&#160; The Brazilian Real exchange rate to the U.S. Dollar at December 31
 2013 was 0.4228
 at December 31
 2014 it was 0.3758 and at December 31
 2015 it was 0.2523.




 &#8211; We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.&#160; As of December 31
 2015
 we maintained our cash
 including restricted cash
 and cash equivalents
 with major banks.&#160; We maintain cash in bank accounts in amounts which at times may exceed federally insured limits.&#160; We have not experienced any losses on such accounts.




 &#8211; Accounts receivable represent amounts receivable on trade accounts.&#160; The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable.&#160; We analyze the aging of customer accounts
 customer concentrations
 customer credit-worthiness
 current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.&#160; From period to period
 differences in judgments or estimates utilized may result in material differences in the amount and timing of the provision for doubtful accounts.&#160; We periodically evaluate our credit policy to ensure that the customers are worthy of terms and support our business plans.




Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value
 with cost determined by the first-in
 first-out method.&#160; In the USA segment
 we employ a full absorption procedure using standard cost techniques.&#160; The standards are customarily reviewed and adjusted annually so that they are materially consistent with actual purchase and production costs.&#160; In the Brazil segment we use actual average purchase and production costs.&#160; Provisions for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory are made based upon our analysis of inventory levels
 historical obsolescence and future sales forecasts; while inventory determined to be obsolete is written off immediately.



Long-Lived Assets
 Intangible Assets and Goodwill
Long-Lived Assets

 consisting primarily of property
 intangible assets
 and goodwill
We test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.&#160; Our annual qualitative or quantitative assessments involve determining an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units in order to evaluate whether an impairment of the current carrying amount of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets exists.&#160; A qualitative assessment evaluates whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit&#8217;s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.&#160; The first step of a quantitative goodwill impairment test
 used to identify potential impairment
 compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount
 including goodwill.&#160; If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount
 goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired
 and
 thus
 the second step of the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary.&#160; If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value
 the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss
When we perform a quantitative estimate of fair value
 we use level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy. The inputs used to calculate the fair value include a number of subjective factors
 such as estimates of future cash flows
 estimates of our future cost structure
 discount rates for our estimated cash flows
 required level of working capital
 assumed terminal value
 and time horizon of cash flow forecasts.&#160; Estimating the fair value of an individual reporting unit requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans
We review our long-lived assets
 which include intangible assets subject to amortization
 for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.&#160; An impairment loss is recognized when the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset to be held and used are not sufficient to recover the unamortized balance of the asset.&#160; An impairment loss is recognized based on the difference between the carrying values and estimated fair value.&#160; The estimated fair value is determined based on either the discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods with the amount of any such deficiency charged to operations in the current year.&#160; Estimates of future cash flows are based on many factors
 including current operating results
 expected market trends and competitive influences.&#160; We also evaluate the amortization periods assigned to its intangible assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value
 less estimated costs to sell.




 &#8211; We recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss pass to our customers
 generally upon shipment for USA segment customers and Brazil segment international customers and upon customer receipt for Brazil segment domestic customers.&#160; Each transaction is evaluated to determine if all of the following four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred; (iii) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.&#160; If any of the above criteria cannot be satisfied then such a transaction is not recorded as revenue
We make provisions for estimated returns
 discounts and price adjustments when they are reasonably estimable.&#160; Revenues on the statements of operations are net of provisions for estimated returns
 routine sales discounts
 volume allowances and adjustments.&#160; Revenues on the statements of operations are also net of taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.









We have certain warrant agreements in effect that contain anti-dilution clauses.&#160; Under these clauses
 we may be required to lower the exercise price on these warrants and issue additional warrants based on future issuances of our common stock and awards of options to employees
 additional issuance of warrants and/or other convertible instruments below certain exercise prices.&#160; 




Share-based compensation expense for employees is calculated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model based on awards ultimately expected to vest
 reduced for estimated forfeitures
 and expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period of the grant.&#160; Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on our historical forfeiture experience and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.&#160; The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model requires us to estimate key assumptions such as expected life
 volatility
 risk-free interest rates and dividend yield to determine the fair value of share-based awards
We account for share-based compensation awards granted to non-employees and consultants by determining the fair value of the awards granted at either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued

 it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached or (ii) the date at which the counterparty's performance is complete.&#160; The expense associated with stock awards issued to consultants or other third parties are recognized over the term of service.&#160; In the event services are terminated early or we require no specific future performance
 the entire amount is expensed.&#160; 




Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.&#160; Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.&#160; A valuation allowance is established
 when necessary
 to reduce that deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.&#160; The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in Brazil.&#160; Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties
 the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that may be different from current estimates of the tax liabilities.&#160; If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment
 an additional charge to expense would result.&#160; If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts
 the reversal of the liabilities may result in income tax benefits being recognized in the period when it is determined that the liabilities are no longer necessary.




 &#8211; The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.&#160; Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates
 actual results could differ from those estimates.









In May 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers
 to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and develop a common revenue standard for GAAP and IFRS.&#160; Under the new guidance
 an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services
In February 2015
 the FASB issued guidance which makes targeted amendments to current consolidation guidance.&#160; Among other things
In April 2015
 the FASB issued guidance which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset.&#160; We elected to early adopt these provisions effective October 1
 2015
 retrospectively for all periods presented.&#160; As a result
 $0.5 million of debt issuance costs as of December 31
 2015
 are presented as a deduction of the related debt in these financial statements.&#160; There were no debt issuance costs included in our statement of financial statements as of December 31
In July 2015
 the FASB issued an amendment which changes the measurement principle for inventory to the lower of cost and net realizable value.&#160; Entities are no longer to consider replacement cost or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin when measuring inventory. We elected to early adopt these provisions prospectively effective October 1
In November 2015
 the FASB issued amendments which change the balance sheet classification of deferred income taxes.&#160; Previous standards required us to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in our statements of financial position.&#160; The amendments require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in our consolidated statements of financial position.&#160; As a result
 each jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability.&#160; We elected to early adopt these provisions effective October 1
 2015
 retrospectively to all periods presented.&#160; As a result
 a $171 thousand deferred tax asset previously classified as current as of December 31
 2014
 is classified as noncurrent
In February 2016
 the FASB issued amendments which change the accounting for leases.&#160; As under prior GAAP
 the recognition
 measurement
 and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease for us as a lessee depend primarily on its classification as a finance or operating lease.&#160; For capital or finance leases
 lessees will recognize amortization of the right-of-use asset separately from interest on the lease liability.&#160; For operating leases

 lessees will recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.&#160;

The main difference between warrants and call options is that warrants are issued and guaranteed by the company
 whereas options are exchange instruments and are not issued by the company. Also
 the lifetime of a warrant is often measured in years
 while the lifetime of a typical option is measured in months. Disclose the title of issue of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding

The estimated amount of dividends to be paid to holders of the underlying shares (expected dividends) over the option's term. Dividends are taken into account because payment of dividends to shareholders reduces the fair value of the underlying shares
 and option holders generally do not receive dividends.




























The estimated measure of the percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.
