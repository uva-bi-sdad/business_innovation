Our portfolio of products is generally classified into the following categories: Starch Products
 Sweetener Products
 and Co-products and others. Within these categories
 a portion of our products are considered specialty ingredients. We refer to the remainder as core products. We describe these three general product categories in more detail below
Our starch products represented approximately 46 percent of our net sales for each of 2020
 2019 and 2018. Starches are an important component in a wide range of processed foods
 where they are used for adhesion
 clouding
 dusting
 expansion
 fat replacement
 freshness
 gelling
 glazing
 mouthfeel
 stabilization
 and texture. Cornstarch is sold to cornstarch packers for sale to consumers. Starches are also used in paper production to create a smooth surface for printed communications and to improve strength in recycled papers. Specialty starches are used for enhanced drainage
 fiber retention
 oil and grease resistance
 improved printability
 and biochemical oxygen demand control. The textile industry uses starches and specialty starches for sizing (abrasion resistance) to provide size and finishes for manufactured products. Industrial starches are used in the production of construction materials
 textiles
 adhesives
 pharmaceuticals
 and cosmetics
 as well as in mining
 water filtration
 and oil and gas drilling. Specialty starches are used for biomaterial applications including biodegradable plastics
 fabric softeners and detergents
 hair and skin care applications
 dusting powders for surgical gloves
 and in the production of glass fiber and insulation.
Our sweetener products represented approximately 35 percent
 36 percent
 and 36 percent of our net sales for 2020
 2019 and 2018
 respectively. &#160;Sweeteners include products such as glucose syrups
 high maltose syrup
 high fructose corn syrup
 dextrose
 polyols
 maltodextrin
 glucose syrup solids
 and non-GMO (genetically modified organism) syrups. Our sweeteners are used in a wide variety of food and beverage products
 such as baked goods
 snack foods
 canned fruits
 condiments
 candy and other sweets
 dairy products
 ice cream
 jams and jellies
 prepared mixes
 table syrups
 soft drinks
 fruit-flavored drinks
 beer
 and many others. These sweetener products also offer functionality in addition to sweetness
 such as texture
 body and viscosity; help control freezing points
 crystallization
 and browning; add humectancy (ability to add moisture) and flavor; and act as binders. Our high maltose syrups speed the fermentation process
 allowing brewers to increase capacity without adding capital. Dextrose has a wide range of applications in the food and confection industries
 in solutions for intravenous (&#8220;IV&#8221;) and other pharmaceutical applications
 and numerous industrial applications like wallboard
 biodegradable surface agents
 and moisture control agents. Our specialty sweeteners provide affordable
 natural
Co-products and others accounted for approximately 19 percent

 2019 and 2018
 respectively. Refined corn oil (from germ) is sold to packers of cooking oil and to producers of margarine
 salad dressings
 shortening
 mayonnaise
 and other foods. Corn gluten feed is sold as animal feed. Corn gluten meal is sold as high-protein feed for chickens
 pet food
 and aquaculture. Our other products include fruit and vegetable products
 such as concentrates

 and essences
: We consider certain of our products to be specialty ingredients. Specialty ingredients accounted for approximately 32 percent of our net sales for 2020
 up from 30 percent and 29 percent in 2019 and 2018
 respectively. These ingredients deliver more functionality than our other products and add additional customer value. Our specialty ingredients are aligned with growing market and consumer trends such as health and wellness
 clean-label
 simple ingredients
 affordability
 indulgence
We drive growth for our specialty ingredients portfolio by leveraging the following five growth platforms: Starch-based Texturizers
 Clean and Simple Ingredients
 Sugar Reduction and Specialty Sweeteners
 Food Systems
: These ingredients support the structure and texture behind great eating experiences.&#160;&#160;Products are made from corn
 potato
 rice
 and tapioca and offer a multitude of textures
 functionalities
These functional ingredients address the clean label trend for finished products made with shorter lists of food ingredients that have achieved broad consumer acceptance. From food and beverages to pet food and personal care
 consumers are looking for clean
 simple
 natural
 and authentic products that they can identify and trust.&#160;&#160;The broad portfolio of clean label ingredients includes: starches
 sweeteners
 flours
 nutrition ingredients
: These solutions provide sweetness and functional replacement for sugar in reduced-calorie and sugar-free foods and beverages without sacrificing quality and consistency.&#160;These specialty ingredients are made from a variety of GMO and non-GMO raw material bases and include such ingredients as plant-based stevia sweeteners

 film formers for candy shells
 foaming and frothing
 adding soluble fibers and nutritional ingredients
 adhering particles to breads
 and emulsification of flavors.
: These specialty pulse-based protein ingredients bring solutions made from lentils
 chickpeas
 fava beans
 and peas.&#160;&#160;They add protein
 dietary fiber
The starch and sweetener industry is highly competitive. Competition within our markets is largely based on product functionality
 price
 and quality. Many of our products are viewed as basic ingredients that compete with virtually identical products and derivatives manufactured by other companies in the industry. The U.S. is a highly competitive market with operations by other starch processors
 several of which are divisions of larger enterprises. Some of these competitors
 unlike us
 have vertically integrated their starch processing and other operations. Competitors include ADM&#8217;s Starches and Sweeteners business within its Carbohydrates Solutions business segment (&#8220;ADM
&#8221; a division of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company)
 Cargill
&#160;Inc. (&#8220;Cargill&#8221;)
 Tate&#160;&amp;&#160;Lyle Ingredients Americas
&#160;Inc. (&#8220;Tate &amp; Lyle&#8221;)
 and several others. Our operations in Mexico and Canada face competition from U.S. imports and local producers including ALMEX
 a Mexican joint venture between ADM and Tate&#160;&amp; Lyle. In South America
Several of our products also compete with products made from raw materials other than corn. High fructose corn syrup and monohydrate dextrose compete principally with cane and beet sugar products. Co-products such as corn oil and gluten meal compete with products of the corn dry milling industry and with soybean oil
 soybean meal
 and other products. Fluctuations in prices of these competing products may affect prices of
 and profits derived from
No customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our net sales in 2020
 2019
Corn (primarily yellow dent) is the primary basic raw material we use to produce starches and sweeteners. The supply of corn in the U.S. has been
 and is anticipated to continue to be
 adequate for our domestic needs. The price of corn
 which is determined by reference to prices on the Chicago Board of Trade
 fluctuates as a result of various factors including: farmers&#8217; planting decisions
 climate
 domestic and foreign government policies (including those related to the production of ethanol)
 livestock feeding
 shortages or surpluses of world grain supplies
 and trade agreements. We use starch from potato processors as the primary raw material to manufacture ingredients derived from potato-based starches. We also use tapioca
 gum
 rice
 plant-based stevia
 peas
 and sugar as raw materials.
Corn is also grown in other areas of the world
 including China
 Brazil
 Europe
 Argentina
 Mexico
 South Africa
 Canada and Pakistan. Our subsidiaries outside the U.S. utilize both local supplies of corn and corn imported from other geographic areas
We also utilize specialty grains such as waxy and high amylose corn in our operations. In general
 the planning cycle for our specialty grain sourcing begins three years in advance of the anticipated delivery of the specialty corn since the necessary seed must be grown in the season prior to grain contracting. In order to secure these specialty grains at the time of our anticipated needs
Due to the competitive nature of our industry and the availability of substitute products not produced from corn
 such as sugar from cane or beets
We follow a policy of hedging our exposure to commodity price fluctuations with commodities futures and options contracts primarily for certain of our North American corn purchases. We use derivative hedging contracts to protect the gross margin of our firm-priced business primarily in North America. Other operations may or may not be hedged at any given time based on management&#8217;s judgment as to the need to fix the costs of our raw materials to protect our profitability. Outside of North America
 we generally enter into short-term commercial sales contracts and adjust our selling prices based upon the local raw material costs. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Other raw materials used in our manufacturing processes include starch from potato processors as the primary raw material to manufacture ingredients derived from potato-based starches. In addition
 we use tapioca
 particularly in certain of our production processes in the Asia-Pacific region. While the price of tapioca fluctuates from time-to-time as a result of growing conditions
 the supply of tapioca has been
 and is anticipated to continue to be
 adequate for our production needs in the various markets in which we operate. In addition to corn
 potato
 and tapioca
 we use pulses
 gums
 rice
 plant-based stevia
 peas
 and sugar as raw materials
We have a global network of more than 500 scientists working in 32 Ingredion Idea Labs&#174; innovation centers with headquarters in Bridgewater
 New Jersey. Activities at Bridgewater include plant science and physical
 chemical and biochemical modifications to food formulations
 food sensory evaluation
 and development of non-food applications such as starch-based biopolymers. In addition
 we have product application technology centers that direct our product development teams worldwide to create product application solutions to better serve the ingredient needs of our customers. Product development activity is focused on developing product applications for identified customer and market needs. Through this approach
 we have developed value-added products for use by customers in various industries. We usually collaborate with customers to develop the desired product application either in the customers&#8217; facilities
 our technical service laboratories
 or on a contract basis. These efforts are supported by our marketing
 product technology
 and technology support staff. R&amp;D expense was approximately $43 million in 2020
 $44 million in 2019
 and $46 million in 2018. Our R&amp;D expense represents investment in new product development and innovation. &#160;Our R&amp;D is further supplemented by technical support services to assist our customers with application development and co-creation.
Our salaried sales personnel
 who are generally dedicated to customers in a geographic region
 sell our products directly to manufacturers and distributors. In addition
 we have staff that provide technical support to our sales personnel on an industry basis. We generally contract with trucking companies to deliver our bulk products to customer destinations. In North America
 we generally use trucks to ship to nearby customers. For those customers located considerable distances from our manufacturing facilities

In addition
 we have joined the&#160;Paradigm for Parity&#174;&#160;coalition
 pledging our commitment to achieving gender parity in corporate leadership roles by 2030. Currently
 both the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors and its Executive Leadership team are comprised of more than 25% women. &#160;The Paradigm for Parity Action Plan is to significantly increase the number of women in senior operating roles.
To continue to attract
 develop
 and retain top talent
 the Company employs a variety of tools and strategies to assess capabilities
 identify skills gaps and provide growth and advancement opportunities based on the needs of the business and our employees. Our total approach to compensation and benefits rewards our employees based on the overall contribution to the business. In addition
As a manufacturer and marketer of food items and items for use in the pharmaceutical industry
 our operations and the use of many of our products are subject to various federal
 state
 foreign and local statutes and regulations
 including the Federal Food
 Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act. We and many of our products are also subject to regulation by various government agencies
 including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Among other things
 applicable regulations prescribe requirements and establish standards for product quality
 purity
 and labeling. Failure to comply with one or more regulatory requirements can result in a variety of sanctions
 including monetary fines. No such fines of a material nature were imposed on us in 2020. We may also be required to comply with federal
 state
 foreign
Our operations are also subject to various federal
 state
 foreign
 and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters
 including air and water quality
 and other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. We operate industrial boilers that fire natural gas
 coal
 or biofuels to operate our manufacturing facilities and they
 along with product dryers
 are our primary source of greenhouse gas emissions. In Argentina
 we are in discussions with local regulators addressing our possible undertaking to conduct studies of possible environmental remediation programs at our Chacabuco manufacturing facility. We are unable to predict the outcome of these discussions
During 2020
Based on current laws and regulations and the enforcement and interpretations thereof
 we do not expect that the costs of future environmental compliance will be a material expense

Our business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty. The following are factors that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. In addition
The spread of COVID-19
 is adversely affecting
 and is expected to continue to adversely affect
In December 2019
 a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan
 China. COVID-19 has since spread to over 100 countries
 including every state in the United States. On March 11
 2020 the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic
 and on March 13
Our global operations expose us to risks associated with COVID-19. &#160;We continue to monitor the health of the employees in each of our 46 manufacturing facilities
 domestically and outside the U.S.
Foreign governmental organizations and governmental organizations at the national
 state and local levels in the U.S. have taken various actions to combat the spread of COVID-19
 including imposing stay-at-home orders that effectively close &#8220;non-essential&#8221; businesses and their operations. &#160;Because we manufacture food ingredients
 our operations are currently considered &#8220;essential&#8221; under most current COVID-19 government regulations
Certain of our customers
 however
 are deemed to be &#8220;non-essential&#8221; industries and businesses under governmental regulations. The industries and businesses deemed &#8220;non-essential&#8221; vary by country and region. &#160;For example
 Mexico declared one or more brewing producers as &#8220;non-essential&#8221; industries for a period of time during the pandemic. &#160;Our customers in affected industries are not able to produce goods during the government-mandated closures
 which adversely affects customer demand for our products. &#160;Further
 government-enacted stay-at-home orders have significantly limited the end-consumers&#8217; ability in the U.S. and foreign markets to purchase certain food or beverage products due to limitations on the operations of restaurants
 bars and regionally specific sales channels. &#160;We expect that these limitations over time will continue to negatively affect customer demand for our products
 further impacting our revenues and our operating results. Further
 any inability by our customers to produce goods may delay our customers&#8217; ability to pay outstanding receivables
In addition
 COVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries
 including negatively affecting economic growth
 the proper functioning of financial and capital markets
currency exchange rates
 and interest rates. Such risks include
 in addition to those described above
 negative impacts on our cost of and access to capital
 pressure to extend our customers&#8217; payment terms
 insolvency of our customers resulting in increased provisions for credit losses
 and counterparty failures in our supply chain
 customer network or otherwise that would negatively impact our operations. &#160;These risks individually and in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operating results
 financial condition
 cash flows and prospects.
Changes in consumer preferences and perceptions may lessen the demand for our products
Food products are often affected by changes in consumer tastes
 national
 regional and local economic conditions and demographic trends. For instance
 changes in prevailing health or dietary preferences causing consumers to avoid food products containing sweetener products
 including high fructose corn syrup
 in favor of foods that are perceived as being more healthy
 could materially reduce our sales and profitability. Increasing concern among consumers
 public health professionals and government agencies about the potential health concerns associated with obesity and inactive lifestyles (reflected
 for instance
 in taxes designed to combat obesity
 which have been imposed recently in North America) represent a significant challenge to some of our customers
 including those engaged in the food and soft drink industries
Current economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products
 reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with whom we do business to suffer financial hardship
 all of which could adversely impact our business
 results of operations
 financial condition
Economic conditions in South America
 the European Union
 and many other countries and regions in which we do business have experienced various levels of weakness over the last few years and may continue to do so for the foreseeable future. General business and economic conditions that could affect us include barriers to trade (including as a result of tariffs
 duties
 and border taxes
 among other factors)
 the strength of the economies in which we operate
 unemployment
 inflation
 and fluctuations in debt markets. While currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations
There could be a number of other effects from these economic developments on our business
 including reduced consumer demand for products
 pressure to extend our customers&#8217; payment terms
 insolvency of our customers resulting in increased provisions for credit losses
 decreased customer demand
 including order delays or cancellations
In connection with our defined benefit pension plans
In addition
 volatile worldwide economic conditions and market instability may make it difficult for us
 our customers
 and our suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends
 which could cause us to produce excess products that could increase our inventory carrying costs. Alternatively
Approximately 54&#160;percent of our 2020 net sales were made to companies engaged in the food industry and approximately 10 percent of our 2020 net sales were made to companies in the beverage industry. Additionally
 sales to the animal nutrition and brewing industry represented approximately 10 percent and approximately 7 percent
 respectively
 of our 2020 net sales
 while 19 percent of our 2020 net sales were made to companies engaged in other industries. If our food customers
 beverage customers
 animal feed customers
 or brewing industry customers were to substantially decrease their purchases
 our business might be materially adversely affected.
The commercial success of agricultural products developed through biotechnology
 including genetically modified corn
 depends in part on public acceptance of their development
 cultivation
 distribution and consumption. Public attitudes can be influenced by claims that genetically modified products are unsafe for consumption or that they pose unknown risks to the environment
 even if such claims are not based on scientific studies. These public attitudes can influence regulatory and legislative decisions about biotechnology. The sale of our products
 which may contain genetically modified corn
 could be delayed or impeded because of adverse public perception regarding the safety of our products and the potential effects of these products on human health
 the environment
A significant portion of our growth depends on innovation in products
 processes
We operate in a highly competitive environment. Competition in markets in which we compete is largely based on price
 quality
 and product availability. Many of our products compete with virtually identical or similar products manufactured by other companies in the starch and sweetener industry. In the U.S.
 our competitors include divisions of larger enterprises that have greater financial resources than we do. Some of these competitors
 unlike us
 have vertically integrated their corn refining and other operations. Many of our products also compete with products made from raw materials other than corn
 including cane and beet sugar. Fluctuation in prices of these competing products may affect prices of
 and profits derived from
 our products. In addition
 government programs supporting sugar prices indirectly impact the price of corn sweeteners
 especially high fructose corn syrup. Furthermore
 co-products such as corn oil and gluten meal compete with products of the corn dry milling industry and with soybean oil
 soybean meal
 and other products
Due to market volatility
 we may be unable to pass potential increases in the cost of corn and other raw materials on to customers through product price increases
The price and availability of corn and other raw materials are subject to volatility as a result of economic and industry conditions
 including supply and demand factors such as crop disease and severe weather conditions that include drought
 floods
 or frost. These conditions are difficult to anticipate
 are beyond our control
Raw material and energy price fluctuations
Our finished products are made primarily from corn. Purchased corn and other raw material costs account for between 40 percent and 65&#160;percent of finished product costs. Some of our products are based upon specific varieties of corn that are produced in significantly less volumes than yellow dent corn. These specialty grains are higher-cost due to their more limited supply and require planning cycles of up to three years in order for us to receive our desired amounts of specialty corn. We also manufacture certain starch-based products from potatoes. Our current potato starch requirements constitute a material portion of the total available North American supply. It is possible that
 in the long term
 continued growth in demand for potato starch-based ingredients and new product development could result in capacity constraints. Also
 we utilize tapioca in the manufacturing of starch products primarily in Thailand
 as well as pulses
 gum
 rice
 plant-based stevia
 and other raw materials around the world. A significant supply disruption or sharp increase in any of these raw material prices that we are unable to recover through pricing increases to our customers could have an adverse impact on our growth and profitability.
Energy costs represent approximately 9&#160;percent of our finished product costs. We use energy primarily to create steam required for our production processes and to dry products. We consume coal
 natural gas
 electricity
 wood
The market prices for our raw materials may vary considerably depending on supply and demand
 world economies
 trade agreements and tariffs
In North America
 we sell a large portion of our finished products derived from corn at firm prices established in supply contracts typically lasting for periods of up to one year. In order to minimize the effect of volatility in the cost of corn related to these firm-priced supply contracts
 we enter into corn futures and options contracts
 or take other hedging positions in the corn futures market. These derivative contracts typically mature within one year. At expiration
 we settle the derivative contracts at a net amount equal to the difference between the then-current price of the commodity and the derivative contract price. The fluctuations in the fair value of these hedging instruments may adversely affect our cash flow. We fund any unrealized losses or receive cash for any unrealized gains on futures contracts on a daily basis. While the corn futures contracts or hedging positions are intended to minimize the effect of volatility of corn costs on operating profits
 the hedging activity can result in losses
Our future profitability and growth depends on our ability to contain operating costs and per unit product costs and to maintain and implement effective cost control programs
 while at the same time maintaining competitive pricing and superior quality products
 customer service
 and support. Our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure depends on continued containment of manufacturing
 delivery
 freight
 and administrative costs
 as well as the implementation of cost-effective purchasing programs for raw materials
 energy
If we are unable to contain our operating costs and maintain the productivity and reliability of our production facilities
Our business could be affected in the future by national and global regulation or taxation of greenhouse gas emissions
 as well as the potential effects of climate change. &#160;Changes in precipitation extremes
 droughts and water availability have the potential to impact Ingredion&#39;s agricultural supply as well as the availability of water for our manufacturing operations. Globally
 a number of countries have instituted or are considering climate change legislation and regulations. Ingredion continues to assess the impact of climate change
 regulatory pressures and changing consumer behaviors on our business strategy. &#160;It is difficult at this time to estimate the likelihood of passage or predict the potential impact of any additional legislation. Potential consequences could include increased energy
 transportation
 and raw materials costs
We may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances
We regularly review potential acquisitions of complementary businesses
 technologies
 services
 or products
 as well as potential strategic alliances. We may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form partnerships or strategic alliances. Even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates
 we may be unable to complete such acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms
 if at all. In addition
 the process of integrating an acquired business
 technology
 service
 or product into our existing business and operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Integration of an acquired company also may require significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our business. Moreover
 we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or strategic alliance
 and such transactions may not generate anticipated financial 
results. Future acquisitions could also require us to issue equity securities
 incur debt
 assume contingent liabilities
 or amortize expenses related to intangible assets
Producing starches and sweeteners through corn refining is a capital intensive industry. We conduct preventive maintenance and de-bottlenecking programs at our 46 manufacturing facilities designed to maintain and improve grind capacity and facility reliability. If we encounter operating difficulties at a facility for an extended period of time or start-up problems with any capital improvement projects
 we may not be able to meet a portion of sales order commitments and could incur significantly higher operating expenses
In addition
 we are subject to risks related to such matters as product safety and quality; compliance with environmental
 health and safety and food safety regulations; and customer product liability claims. The liabilities that could result from these risks may not always be covered by
 or could exceed the limits of
 our insurance coverage related to product liability and food safety matters. In addition
We operate a multinational business subject to the economic
 political
We have operated in foreign countries and with foreign currencies for many years. Our results are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Our operations are subject to political
 economic
 and other risks. There has been and continues to be significant political uncertainty in some countries in which we operate. Economic changes
 terrorist activity
We primarily sell products derived from world commodities. Historically
 we have been able to adjust local prices relatively quickly to offset the effect of local currency devaluations versus the U.S. dollar
 although we cannot guarantee our ability to do this in the future. For example
 due to pricing controls on many consumer products imposed in the recent past by the Argentine government
 it currently takes longer than previously to achieve pricing improvement in response to currency devaluations versus the U.S. dollar in Argentina. The anticipated strength in the U.S. dollar may continue to involve risks
 as it could take us an extended period of time to fully recapture the impact of foreign currency devaluations versus the U.S. dollar
As of December 31
 2020
 approximately 31&#160;percent of our U.S. employees and 32&#160;percent of our total Company employees were members of unions. Strikes
 lockouts
Natural disasters
 war
 acts and threats of terrorism
 pandemics
The economies of any countries in which we sell or manufacture products or purchase raw materials could be affected by natural disasters. Such natural disasters could include
 among others
 earthquakes
 floods
 or severe weather; 
war
 acts of war
 or terrorism; or the outbreak of an epidemic or pandemic. &#160;Any such natural disaster could result in asset write-offs
We have $1.3 billion of total net intangible assets as of December&#160;31
&#160;2020
 consisting of $902 million of goodwill and $444 million of other net intangible assets
 which constitute 13 percent and 6 percent
 respectively
 of our total assets as of such date. Additionally
 we have $2.8 billion of long-lived assets
 or 41 percent of our total assets
 as of December&#160;31
We perform an annual impairment assessment for goodwill and our indefinite-lived intangible assets
 and as necessary
 for other long-lived assets. If the results of such assessments were to show that the fair value of these assets were less than the carrying values
 we could be required to recognize a charge for impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets
In addition
 during the fourth quarter of 2020
 we recorded an impairment of $35 million related to our indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with the TIC Gums tradename. During the first quarter of 2021
The future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment
 such as a significant adverse change in the business climate that would require a change in our assumptions or strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions
 could require us to perform an assessment prior to the next required assessment date of July&#160;1
Our operating income and ability to increase profitability depend to a large extent upon our ability to price finished products at a level that will cover manufacturing and raw material costs and provide an acceptable profit margin. Our ability to maintain appropriate price levels is determined by a number of factors largely beyond our control
 such as aggregate industry supply and market demand
 which may vary from time to time
Our operating results could be affected by changes in trade
 monetary and fiscal policies
 laws and regulations
 and other activities of the U.S. and foreign governments
 agencies
 and similar organizations. These conditions include
 among others
 changes in a country&#8217;s or region&#8217;s economic or political conditions
 modification or termination of trade agreements or treaties promoting free trade
 creation of new trade agreements or treaties
 trade regulations affecting production
 pricing and marketing of products
 local labor conditions and regulations
 reduced protection of intellectual property rights
 changes in the regulatory or legal environment
 restrictions on currency exchange activities
 currency exchange rate fluctuations
 burdensome taxes and tariffs
 and other trade barriers. International risks and uncertainties
 including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism
 political hostilities
 and war
 could limit our ability to transact business in these markets and could adversely affect our revenues and operating results.
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction
 changes in tax laws
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (&#8220;TCJA&#8221;)
 which was enacted in December 2017
 significantly altered existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous and complex provisions that substantially affect our business. The U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service continue to interpret and issue guidance on provisions of the TCJA that could differ from the way in which we interpret some of the provisions. &#160;Consequently
OECD-led coalition of 44 countries is contemplating changes to long-standing international tax norms that determine each country&#8217;s right to tax cross-border transactions. These contemplated changes
countries in which we do business
of double taxation
The recoverability of our deferred tax assets
 which are predominantly in Brazil
 Canada
 Germany
 Mexico
 and the U.S.
 is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in these jurisdictions. In addition
We may continue to issue debt securities to finance acquisitions
 capital expenditures
 and working capital
 or for other general corporate purposes. An increase in interest rates in the general economy could result in an increase in our borrowing costs for these financings
We may not have access to additional funds we need to grow and expand our operations. We expect to fund our capital expenditures from operating cash flow to the extent we are able to do so. If our operating cash flow is insufficient to fund our capital expenditures
 we may either reduce our capital expenditures or utilize borrowings under our credit facilities. For further strategic growth through mergers or acquisitions
 we may also seek to generate additional liquidity through the sale of debt or equity securities in private or public markets or through the sale of assets. We cannot provide any assurance that our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures or that we will be able to obtain additional funds from financial markets or from the sale of assets at terms favorable to us. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or raise sufficient additional funds to cover our capital expenditures or other strategic growth opportunities
 we may not be able to achieve our desired operating efficiencies and expansion plans
 which may adversely impact our competitiveness and
 therefore
 our results of operations. Our working capital requirements
 including margin requirements on open positions on futures exchanges
 are directly affected by the price of corn and other agricultural commodities
 which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly.
Our information technology systems
 processes
 and sites may suffer interruptions
 security breaches
Our operations rely on certain key information technology systems
 which are dependent on services provided by third parties
 and provide critical data connectivity
 information
 and services for internal and external users. These interactions include
 among others
 ordering and managing materials from suppliers
 risk management activities
 converting raw materials to finished products
 inventory management
 shipping products to customers
 processing transactions
 summarizing and reporting results of operations
 human resources benefits and payroll management
 complying with regulatory
 legal and tax requirements
 and other processes necessary to manage our business. Increased information technology security and social engineering threats and more sophisticated computer crime
 including advanced persistent threats
 pose potential risks to the security of our information technology systems
 networks and services
 as well as the confidentiality
 availability and integrity of our third-party and employee data. &#160;We have put in place security measures to protect ourselves against cyber-based attacks and disaster recovery plans for our critical systems. However
 if our information technology systems are breached
 damaged
 or cease to function properly due to any number of causes
 such as catastrophic events
 power outages
 security breaches
 or cyber-based attacks
 and if our disaster recovery plans do not effectively mitigate the risks on a timely basis
 we may encounter significant disruptions that could interrupt our ability to manage our operations
 cause loss of valuable data and actual or threatened legal actions
 and cause us to suffer damage to our reputation
 all of which may adversely impact our revenues
 operating results
 and financial condition. We reported a malware incident that occurred from October 2019 to December 2019
The costs to address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant. Remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions
 delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales
 manufacturing or other critical functions. Breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers or other third parties could expose us
 our customers or other affected third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information
 result in regulatory enforcement
 litigation and potential liability for us
Volatility in the stock market
 fluctuations in quarterly operating results
The market price for our common stock may be significantly affected by factors such as our announcement of new products or services or such announcements by our competitors; technological innovation by us
 our competitors or other vendors; quarterly variations in our operating results or the operating results of our competitors; general conditions in our or our customers&#8217; markets; and changes in earnings estimates by analysts or reported results that vary materially from such estimates. In addition
No assurance can be given that we will continue to pay dividends
The payment of dividends
 as well as the amount of any dividends
 is solely at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Future dividend payments
 if any
 also will be subject to our financial results and the availability of statutory surplus funds to pay dividends. These factors could result in a change to our current policy of paying dividends.
We identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to ineffective information technology general controls which
 if not remediated appropriately or timely
Internal controls related to the operation of information technology (&#8220;IT&#8221;) systems are critical to maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As disclosed in Part II
 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020
 management identified a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls in the areas of user access over certain IT systems that support the Company&#8217;s financial reporting processes. As a result
 management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31
 2020. We seek to remediate the material weakness prior to the end of fiscal 2021
 but may not succeed in doing so. Remedial measures may require us to invest in additional technology and other expenses. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness
 or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures
 our ability to record
 process and report financial information accurately
 and to prepare financial statements within required time periods
 could be adversely affected
 which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses
 negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price.
We own or lease (as noted below)
 directly and through our consolidated subsidiaries
 46 manufacturing facilities. In addition

 South America
 Asia-Pacific and Europe
 the Middle East and Africa (&#8220;EMEA&#8221;)
 and we manage and operate our businesses at a regional level. We believe this approach provides us with a unique understanding of the cultures and product requirements in each of the geographic markets in which we operate
 bringing added value to our customers. Our ingredients are used by customers in the food
 beverage
 brewing
 and animal feed industries
Our strategic growth roadmap is based on five growth platforms and is designed to deliver shareholder value by accelerating customer co-creation and enabling consumer-preferred innovation. Our first platform is starch-based texturizers
 the second platform is clean and simple ingredients
 the third platform is plant-based proteins
 the fourth platform is sugar reduction and specialty sweeteners
 and finally
Critical success factors in our business include managing our manufacturing costs
 including costs for corn
 other raw materials
 and utilities. In addition
 our global operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivative financial instruments
 when appropriate
 for the purpose of minimizing the risks and costs associated with fluctuations in certain raw material and energy costs
 foreign exchange rates
 and interest rates. The capital intensive nature of our business requires that we generate significant cash flow over time in order to selectively reinvest in our operations and grow organically
For the year ended December 31
 2020
 operating income
 net income
 and diluted earnings per common share declined from 2019 levels. The decreases were attributable primarily to reductions in volumes driven by government-mandated shutdowns associated with COVID-19
 particularly in the Americas
 increased restructuring and impairment charges associated with the impairments of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and an equity method investment
 &#160;Our operations in recent periods have been adversely affected by impacts of COVID-19. On March 11
 2020
 the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic
 and on March 13
 2020 the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises
 including pandemics such as COVID-19. &#160;Foreign governmental organizations and governmental organizations at the national
 state and local levels in the United States have taken various actions to combat the spread of COVID-19
 including imposing stay-at-home orders and closing &#8220;non-essential&#8221; businesses and their operations. &#160;As a manufacturer of food ingredients
 our operations are considered &#8220;essential&#8221; under most current COVID-19 government regulations
 and our facilities are operating globally. We did not experience any material supply chain interruptions during the twelve months ended December 31
The Company anticipates continued impacts from COVID-19 on net sales volume across our operating segments in the first quarter of 2021. &#160;We are monitoring COVID-19 infection rates as well as the pace and effectiveness of vaccination rollouts
 as the net sales volume is generally correlated with increased consumer activity and availability of food and beverages consumed away from home. 
In July 2018
 we announced a $125 million savings target for our Cost Smart program
 designed to improve profitability
 further streamline our global business
 and deliver increased value to stockholders. We set Cost Smart savings targets to include an anticipated $75 million in Cost of sales savings
 including freight
 and $50 million in anticipated SG&amp;A savings by year-end 2021. Since the program&#8217;s inception
Our Cost Smart program and other initiatives resulted in restructuring charges in 2020. &#160;For the year ended December 31
 2020
 we recorded a total of $48 million of pre-tax restructuring charges related to these programs
 a decrease of $9 million from the restructuring charges recorded for 2019. &#160;We recorded $25 million of restructuring charges for our Cost Smart SG&amp;A program
 primarily related to professional service costs in North America during the year
 and $23 million of restructuring charges for our Cost Smart Cost of sales program
During the year ended December 31
 2020
 we also recorded $45 million of pre-tax impairment charges
We incurred storm damage to the Cedar Rapids
 Iowa manufacturing facility
 which was shut down for ten days in August 2020. &#160;The storm-related damage resulted in $3 million of charges during the twelve months ended December 31
 2020. We recorded the storm damage costs within Other expense (income)
Our cash provided by operating activities increased to $829 million for the year ended December&#160;31
&#160;2020
 from $680 million in the prior year primarily due to changes in working capital. Our cash used by investing activities increased to $571 million for the year ended December 31
 2020
 from $374 million in the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of a controlling interest in PureCircle. Our cash provided by financing activities was $143 million during the year ended December 31
 2020
 while our cash used for financing activities was $364 million for the year ended December 31
 2019. This change was primarily due to our sale of $1 billion of senior notes during the year ended December 31
 2020
We currently expect that our available cash balances
 future cash flow from operations
 access to debt markets
 and borrowing capacity under our credit facilities will provide us with sufficient liquidity to fund our anticipated capital expenditures
 dividends
 and other investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. Our future cash flow needs will depend on many factors
 including our rate of revenue growth
 the timing and extent of our expansion into new markets
 the timing of introductions of new products
 potential acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies
 continuing market acceptance of our new products
 and general economic and market conditions. We may need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to fund our needs for less predictable strategic initiatives
We have significant operations in four reporting segments: North America
 South America
 Asia-Pacific and EMEA. For most of our foreign subsidiaries
 the local foreign currency is the functional currency. Accordingly
We acquired a controlling interest in PureCircle on July 1
 2020
 acquired Verdient on November 3
 2020
 and Western Polymer LLC (&#8220;Western Polymer&#8221;) on March 1
 2019. The results of the acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial results from the respective acquisition dates forward. While we identify fluctuations due to the acquisitions
 our discussion below also addresses results of operations excluding the impact of the acquisitions and the results of the acquired businesses

 the Company recorded a $22 million pre-tax benefit
 in accordance with ASC 450
 
 for the three and twelve months ended December 31

In January 2019
 the Company&#8217;s Brazilian subsidiary received a favorable decision from the Federal Court of Appeals in Sao Paulo
 Brazil
 related to certain indirect taxes collected in prior years. &#160;As a result of the decision
 the Company expects to be entitled to indirect tax credits against its Brazilian federal tax payments in 2020 and future years. &#160;The Company finalized its calculation of the amount of the credits and interest due from the favorable decision
 concluding that the Company could be entitled to approximately $86 million of credits spanning a period from 2005 to 2018. &#160;The Department of Federal Revenue of Brazil
 however
 issued an Internal Ruling in which it charged that the Company is entitled to only $22 million of the calculated indirect tax credits and interest for the period from 2005 to 2014. &#160;The Brazil National Treasury has filed a motion for clarification with the Brazilian Supreme Court
 asking the Court
 among other things
 to modify the lower court&#8217;s decision to approve the Internal Ruling
 which could impact the decision in favor of the Company. &#160;Due to the uncertainty arising from the issuance of the Internal Ruling
 the Company recorded $22 million of credits in 2019 in accordance with ASC 450
. &#160;The $22 million of future tax credits
 which was recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement in Other income
 resulted in additional deferred income taxes of $8 million. &#160;The income taxes will be paid as and when the tax credits are utilized. &#160;The Company received further clarification from the court in 2020 regarding the calculation of the Company&#8217;s benefits and recorded additional credits

To manage price risk related to corn purchases
 we use derivative instruments
 consisting of corn futures and options contracts
 to lock in our corn costs associated with firm-priced customer sales contracts. As the market price of these commodities fluctuates
 our derivative instruments change in value and we fund any unrealized losses or receive cash for any unrealized gains related to outstanding commodity futures and option contracts. We plan to continue to use 
derivative instruments to hedge such price risk and
 accordingly

On December&#160;11
 2020
 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.64 per share of common stock. This dividend was paid on January&#160;28
 2021
 to stockholders of record at the close of business on January 4
We paid $340 million of capital expenditures and mechanical stores purchases to update
 expand and improve our facilities in 2020. &#160;In July 2020
 we acquired a controlling interest in PureCircle for $208 million
We have not provided foreign withholding taxes
 state income taxes
 and federal and state taxes on foreign currency gains/losses on accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries because these earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. It is not practicable to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings. We do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business
 including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements. Approximately $427 million of our total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $665 million at December&#160;31
&#160;2020
 We are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in commodity prices (primarily corn and natural gas)
 foreign-currency exchange rates
 and interest rates. In the normal course of business
 we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions
 authorized under established policies that place controls on these activities. These transactions utilize exchange-traded derivatives or over-the-counter derivatives with investment grade counterparties. Our hedging transactions may include
 but are not limited to
 a variety of derivative financial instruments such as commodity-related futures
 options and swap contracts
 forward currency-related contracts and options
 interest rate swap agreements
 Our principal use of derivative financial instruments is to manage commodity price risk in North America relating to anticipated purchases of corn and natural gas to be used in our manufacturing process. We periodically enter into futures
 options and swap contracts for a portion of our anticipated corn and natural gas usage
 generally over the following 12 to 24 months
 in order to hedge price risk associated with fluctuations in market prices. Unrealized gains and losses associated with marking our commodities-based cash flow hedge derivative instruments to market are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (&#8220;OCI&#8221;). As of December&#160;31
&#160;2020
 our Accumulated other comprehensive loss account (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) included $47 million of net gains (net of income tax expense of $16 million) related to these derivative instruments. It is anticipated that $44 million of net gains (net of income tax expense of $15 million) will be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months. We expect the net gains to be offset by changes in the underlying commodities costs.
 Due to our global operations
 including operations in many emerging markets
 we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates. As a result
 we have exposure to translational foreign-exchange risk when our foreign operations&#8217; results are translated to U.S. dollars and to transactional foreign-exchange risk when transactions not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit are revalued into U.S. dollars. We primarily use derivative financial instruments such as foreign-currency forward contracts

 Derivatives and Hedging
&#160;2020
As of December&#160;31
&#160;2020
 we had foreign-currency forward sales contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $401 million and foreign-currency forward purchase contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $542 million designated as cash flow hedging instruments. The amount included in AOCI relating to these hedges at December&#160;31
&#160;2020
We have significant operations in Argentina. In the second quarter of 2018
 the Argentine peso rapidly devalued relative to the U.S. dollar
 which along with increased inflation
 indicated that the three-year cumulative inflation in that country exceeded 100 percent as of June 30
 2018. As a result
 we elected to adopt hyperinflation accounting as of July 1
 2018 for our affiliate
 Ingredion Argentina S.A. Under hyperinflation accounting
 our affiliate&#8217;s functional currency is the U.S. dollar
 We occasionally use interest rate swaps and T-Locks to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes
 to reduce the volatility of our financing costs
 or to achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floating rate debt
 based on current and projected market conditions. We did not have any T-Locks outstanding as of December&#160;31
As of December&#160;31
&#160;2020
As of December&#160;31
&#160;2020
 the Company did not have any outstanding interest rate swaps. As of December 31
 2019
 the Company had an outstanding interest rate swap agreement that converted the interest rates on $200 million of its $400 million 4.625% senior notes due November 1
 2020
 to variable rates. The Company redeemed these notes in July 2020 and settled the outstanding interest rate swap.

We use certain key financial performance metrics to monitor our progress towards achieving our long-term strategic business objectives. These metrics relate to our ability to drive profitability
 create value for stockholders
 and monitor our financial leverage. We assess whether we are achieving our profitability and value creation objectives by measuring our Adjusted Return on Invested Capital (&#8220;Adjusted ROIC&#8221;). We monitor our financial leverage by regularly reviewing our ratio of net debt to adjusted earnings before interest
 taxes
The metrics Adjusted ROIC and Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA include certain information (Adjusted Operating Income
 net of tax and Adjusted EBITDA
 respectively) that is not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). We also have presented below the most comparable metrics calculated using components determined in accordance with GAAP. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally for strategic decision-making
 forecasting future results
 and evaluating current performance. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide a more consistent comparison of our operating results and trends for the periods presented. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that
 when viewed with our GAAP results
 provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. These non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to
 and not as a substitute for
 or superior to
In accordance with our long-term objectives
 we set certain objectives relating to these key financial performance metrics that we strive to meet. However
Adjusted ROIC is a financial performance ratio not defined under GAAP
 and it should be considered in addition to
 and not as a substitute for
 GAAP financial measures. &#160;The Company defines Adjusted ROIC as Adjusted operating income
 net of tax
 divided by Average end-of-year balances for current year and prior year Total net debt and equity. &#160;Similarly named measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. &#160;The Company believes Adjusted ROIC is meaningful to investors as it focuses on profitability and value-creating potential
 taking into account the amount of capital invested. The most comparable measure calculated using components determined in accordance with GAAP is Return on Invested Capital
 which the Company defines as Net income
 divided by Average end-of-year balances for current year and prior year Total net debt and equity. The calculations for Return on Invested Capital and Adjusted ROIC for the periods indicated are provided in the table below.

 we received a favorable judgment from the Federal Court of Appeals in Brazil related to certain indirect taxes collected in prior years. To account for the judgment
 we recorded a $22 million pre-tax benefit for the favorable judgment
 in accordance with ASC 450
 Contingencies for the year ended December 31
 2019. This benefit was offset by other adjusted charges during the period. In the current year
 we received another favorable court judgment that further clarifies the calculation of our benefit
 resulting in a larger indirect tax claim against the government. As a result
 we recorded an additional $35 million pre-tax benefit for the year ended December 31
 2020. We expect to be entitled to credits against Brazilian federal tax payments in 2021 and future years. The total benefit recorded represents our current estimate of the credits and interest due from the favorable decision in accordance with ASC 450
 Contingencies. In addition
 we received a second favorable ruling in Brazil reversing the taxes previously paid related to a government subsidy. We recorded a pre-tax benefit of $1 million and tax provision benefit of $3 million related to this second ruling for the year ended December 31
 2020.

Our long-term objective is to maintain an Adjusted ROIC in excess of 10 percent. &#160;For the year ended December 31
 2020
 we achieved an Adjusted ROIC of 10.8 percent as compared to 12.1 percent for the year ended December 31
 2019. The decrease in Adjusted ROIC percentage is primarily a result of an increase in equity and a lower adjusted operating income

Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
We have identified below the most critical accounting policies upon which the financial statements are based and that involve our most complex and subjective decisions and assessments. Our senior management has discussed the development
 Our acquisitions of PureCircle and Verdient in 2020 were accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 805
. In purchase accounting
 identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed
 are recognized at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date
 and any remaining purchase price is recorded as goodwill. In determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
 we make significant estimates and assumptions
 particularly with respect to long-lived tangible and intangible assets. Critical estimates used in valuing tangible and intangible assets include
 but are not limited to
 future expected cash flows
 discount rates
 market prices and asset lives. Although our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable
 actual results may differ. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our acquisitions.
Property
 Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets:
 plant and equipment (&#8220;PP&amp;E&#8221;) and definite-lived intangible assets. For PP&amp;E
 we recognize the cost of depreciable assets in operations over the estimated useful life of the assets and evaluate the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. For definite-lived intangible assets
 we recognize the cost of these amortizable assets in operations over their estimated useful life and evaluate the recoverability of the assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. The carrying values of PP&amp;E and definite-lived intangible assets at December&#160;31
&#160;2020
 were $2.5 billion and $301 million
In assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of PP&amp;E and definite-lived intangible assets
 we may have to make projections regarding future cash flows. In developing these projections
 we make a variety of important assumptions and estimates that have a significant impact on our assessments of whether the carrying values of PP&amp;E and definite-lived intangible assets should be adjusted to reflect impairment. Among these are assumptions and estimates about the future growth and profitability of the related asset group
 anticipated future economic
Through our continual assessment to optimize our operations
Even though it was determined that there was no long-lived asset impairment as of December&#160;31
&#160;2020
 the future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment
 such as a significant adverse change in the business climate that would require a change in our assumptions or strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions
We have certain indefinite-lived intangible assets in the form of tradenames and trademarks. Our methodology for allocating the purchase price of acquisitions is based on established valuation techniques that reflect the consideration of a number of factors
 including valuations performed by third-party appraisers when appropriate. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value assigned to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We have identified several reporting units for which cash flows are determinable and to which goodwill may be allocated. Goodwill is either assigned to a specific reporting unit or allocated between reporting units based on the relative excess fair value of each reporting unit. The carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at December&#160;31
&#160;2020
 was $143 million and $902 million
 respectively
 compared to $178 million and $801 million
 respectively
 at December 31
We assess indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise). We perform this annual impairment assessment as of July 1 each year. In testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment
 we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. After assessing the qualitative factors
 if we determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount
 then we would not be required to compute the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. In the event the qualitative assessment leads us to conclude otherwise
 then we would be required to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and perform a quantitative impairment test in accordance with ASC subtopic 350-30. In performing the qualitative analysis
 we consider various factors including net sales derived from these intangibles and certain market and industry conditions. Based on the results of our assessment
 we concluded that as of July 1
 2020
Subsequent to the Company&#8217;s annual assessment
 the Company identified an impairment indicator and recorded an impairment of $35 million for its indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with the TIC Gums tradename. The impairment event was the result of management&#8217;s decision to rebrand the TIC Gums products using the broader Ingredion 
In testing goodwill for impairment
 we first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. After assessing the qualitative factors
 if we determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount
 then we do not perform an impairment test. If we conclude otherwise
 then we perform the impairment test as described in ASC Topic 350. Under this impairment test
 the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of its net assets
 goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit
In performing our impairment tests for goodwill
 management makes certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments include the identification of reporting units and the determination of fair values of reporting units
 which management estimates using both discounted cash flow analyses and an analysis of market multiples. Significant assumptions used in the determination of fair value for reporting units include estimates for discount and long-term net sales growth rates
 in addition to operating and capital expenditure requirements. We consider changes in discount rates for the reporting units based on current market interest rates and specific risk factors within each geographic region. We also evaluate qualitative factors
 such as legal
 regulatory
 or competitive forces
 in estimating the impact to the fair value of the reporting units noting no significant changes that would result in any reporting unit failing the impairment test. Changes in assumptions concerning projected results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the reporting units in the future. Based on the results of the annual assessment
 we concluded that as of July 1
 2020
 We recognize the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities and provide a valuation allowance when deferred tax assets are not more likely than not to be realized. We have considered forecasted earnings
 future taxable income
 the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate
 and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future
 we would increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination. Likewise
 if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets
 we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance. We had a valuation allowance of $30 million and $29 million at December&#160;31
&#160;2020 and 2019
We are regularly audited by various taxing authorities
 and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in our owing additional taxes. We establish reserves when
 despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law
 we believe there is uncertainty with respect to certain positions and we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefits. We evaluate these unrecognized tax benefits and related reserves each quarter and adjust the reserves and the related interest and penalties in light of changing facts and circumstances regarding the probability of realizing tax benefits
 such as the settlement of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable. However
 final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities
 either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations
 could be materially different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision
 net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for any known tax contingencies. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits
 excluding interest and penalties at December&#160;31
&#160;2020
 and 2019 was $46 million and $22 million
The Company recorded a $31 million liability for foreign withholding and state income taxes on certain unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries. No foreign withholding taxes
 state income taxes and federal and state taxes on foreign currency gains and losses have been provided on approximately $2.2 billion of undistributed earnings of 
foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested. If future events
 including changes in tax law
 material changes in estimates of cash
 working capital
 and long-term investment requirements
 necessitate that these earnings be distributed
 an additional provision for income taxes may apply
 We and our subsidiaries sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans (qualified and non-qualified) covering a substantial portion of employees in the U.S. and Canada
 and certain employees in other foreign countries. We also provide healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired employees in the U.S.
 Canada
 and Brazil. In order to measure the expense and obligations associated with these benefits
 our management must make a variety of estimates and assumptions
 including discount rates
 expected long-term rates of return
 rate of compensation increases
 employee turnover rates
 retirement rates
 mortality rates
 and other factors. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis as of December&#160;31 (or more frequently if a significant event requiring remeasurement occurs) and modify our assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is appropriate to do so. The effects of modifications are recognized immediately on the balance sheet
 but are generally amortized into operating earnings over future periods
 with the deferred amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. We believe the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans
 which are based on our experience
 market conditions
 and input from our actuaries
 are reasonable. We use third-party specialists to assist management in evaluating our assumptions and estimates
 as well as to appropriately measure the costs and obligations associated with our retirement benefit plans. Had we used different estimates and assumptions with respect to these plans
 our retirement benefit obligations and related expense could vary from the actual amounts recorded
 and such differences could be material. Additionally
We determine our assumption for the discount rate used to measure year-end pension and postretirement obligations based on high-quality fixed-income investments that match the duration of the expected benefit payments
 which has been benchmarked using a long-term
 high-quality AA corporate bond index. We use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The weighted average discount rate used to determine our obligations under U.S. pension plans as of December 31
 2020 and 2019 was 2.58 percent and 3.34 percent
 respectively. The weighted average discount rate used to determine our obligations under non-U.S. pension plans as of December 31
 2020 and 2019 was 2.84 percent and 3.55 percent
 respectively. The weighted average discount rate used to determine our obligations under our postretirement plans as of December 31
 2020 and 2019 was 3.69 percent and 4.18 percent
A one percentage point decrease in the discount rates at December 31
 2020
 would have increased the accumulated benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation by the following amounts (millions):
Our current investment policy for our pension plans is to balance risk and return through diversified portfolios of actively-managed equity index instruments
 fixed income index securities
 and short-term investments. Maturities for fixed income securities are managed such that sufficient liquidity exists to meet near-term benefit payment obligations. The asset allocation is reviewed regularly and portfolio investments are rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate or to raise sufficient liquidity when necessary to meet near-term benefit payment obligations. For 2020 net periodic pension cost
 we assumed an expected long-term rate of return on assets
 which is based on the fair value of plan assets
 of 5.30 percent for U.S. plans and approximately 3.81 percent for Canadian plans. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption on plan assets
 which consist mainly of U.S. and Canadian debt and equity securities
 management evaluated historical rates of return achieved on plan assets and the asset allocation of the plans
 input from our independent actuaries and investment consultants
Healthcare cost trend rates are used in valuing our postretirement benefit obligations and are established based upon actual health care cost trends and consultation with actuaries and benefit providers. At December 31
 2020
 the health care cost trend rate assumptions for the next year for the U.S.
 Canada
 and Brazil plans were 5.90 percent
 5.83 percent and 7.07 percent
 respectively.

We are exposed to interest rate risk on our variable rate debt and price risk on our fixed rate debt. As of December&#160;31
&#160;2020
 approximately 79 percent or $1.7 billion of our total debt is fixed rate debt and 21 percent or approximately $451 million of our total debt is variable rate debt subject to changes in short-term rates
 which could affect our interest costs. We assess market risk based on changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential change in earnings
 fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 1 percentage point change in interest rates at December&#160;31
As of December&#160;31

A hypothetical change of 1 percentage point in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt at December&#160;31
&#160;2020
 by approximately $212 million. Since we have no current plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed rate instruments before their maturities
The Company periodically enters into interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate changes. The changes in fair value of interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments that effectively offset the variability in the fair value of outstanding debt obligations are reported in earnings. These amounts offset the gains or losses (the changes in fair value) of the hedged debt instruments that are attributable to changes in interest rates (the hedged risk)
 which are also recognized in earnings. As of December 31
 2020
 the Company did not have any outstanding interest rate swaps. As of December 31
 2019
 the Company had an outstanding interest rate swap agreement that converted the interest rates on $200 million of its $400 million 4.625% senior notes due November 1

Raw Material
 Energy
 and Other Commodity Exposure:
 we sell a large portion of finished products at firm prices established in supply contracts typically lasting for periods of up to one year. In order to minimize the effect of volatility in the cost of corn related to these firm-priced supply contracts
 we enter into corn futures contracts or take other hedging positions in the corn futures market. These contracts typically mature within one year. At expiration
 we settle the derivative contracts at a net amount equal to the difference between the then-current price of corn and the futures contract price. While these hedging instruments are subject to fluctuations in value
 changes in the value of the underlying exposures we are hedging generally offset such fluctuations. While the corn futures contracts or other hedging positions are intended to minimize the volatility of corn costs on operating profits
 occasionally the hedging activity can result in losses
 some of which may be material. Outside of North America
 sales of finished products under long-term
 firm-priced supply contracts are not material.
Energy costs represent approximately 9 percent of our cost of sales. The primary use of energy is to create steam in the production process and to dry product. We consume coal
 natural gas
 electricity
 wood
 and fuel oil to generate energy. The market prices for these commodities vary depending on supply and demand
 world economies and other factors. We purchase these commodities based on our anticipated usage and the future outlook for these costs. We cannot assure that we will be able to purchase these commodities at prices that we can adequately pass on to customers to sustain or increase profitability. We use derivative financial instruments
 such as over-the-counter natural gas swaps
 to hedge portions of our natural gas costs generally over the following 12 to 24 months
At December&#160;31
&#160;2020
 we had outstanding futures and option contracts that hedged the forecasted purchase of approximately 95 million bushels of corn. We also had outstanding swap and option contracts that hedged the forecasted purchase of approximately 33 million mmbtu&#8217;s of natural gas at December&#160;31
&#160;2020. Based on our overall commodity hedge position at December&#160;31
&#160;2020
 a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market prices applied to the fair value of the instruments would result in a charge to other comprehensive income of approximately $3 million
 net of income tax benefit of $1 million. Any change in the fair value of the contracts
 real or hypothetical
 Due to our global operations
 we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result
We selectively use derivative instruments such as forward contracts
 currency swaps and options to manage transactional foreign exchange risk. Based on our overall foreign currency transactional exposure at December&#160;31
&#160;2020
 we estimate that a hypothetical 10 percent decline in the value of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a transactional foreign exchange gain of approximately $24&#160;million. At December&#160;31
&#160;2020
 our accumulated other comprehensive loss account included in the equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheet includes a cumulative translation loss of approximately $1.1 billion. The aggregate net assets of our foreign subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency approximated $1.7&#160;billion at December&#160;31
&#160;2020. A&#160;hypothetical 10 percent decline in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies would have resulted in a reduction to our cumulative translation loss and a credit to other comprehensive income of approximately $190 million.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ingredion Incorporated and&#160;subsidiaries (the Company) as of December&#160;31
 2020 and 2019
 the related consolidated statements of income
 comprehensive income
 equity and redeemable equity
 and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December&#160;31
 2020
 and the related notes (collectively
 the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion
 the consolidated financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of December&#160;31
 2020 and 2019
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December&#160;31
 2020
We also have audited
 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)
 the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December&#160;31
 2020
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
 and our report dated February 24
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements
 the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases effective January 1
 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements
 whether due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging
 subjective
 or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements
 taken as a whole
 and we are not
 by communicating the critical audit matters below
As discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements
 the Company&#8217;s estimated pension benefit obligations totaled $684 million as of December 31
 2020. The Company&#8217;s OPEB includes plans in the US
 Brazil and Canada
 which are fully unfunded liabilities. As of December 31
 2020
 the Company had a net liability of $68 million related to the Company&#8217;s OPEB plans. The pension and OPEB obligations are measured at the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which employees are currently entitled based on the employee&#8217;s expected date of separation or retirement. The determination of the Company&#8217;s pension and OPEB obligations is dependent
 in part
 on the selection of certain estimates and actuarial assumptions
We identified the evaluation of the pension and OPEB obligations as a critical audit matter.  Significant auditor judgment was required to evaluate the actuarial models and methodology used by the Company to determine the obligations
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company&#8217;s pension and OPEB obligations process
 including controls related to the assessment of the actuarial models and methodology and the development of the discount rates. For certain plans we involved an actuarial professional with specialized skill and knowledge
the evaluation of the Company&#8217;s discount rates
 by assessing changes in the discount rates from the prior year and comparing it to the change in published indices
the evaluation of the selected yield curve
 the consistency of the yield curve with the prior year
 and the spot rates
As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements
 the Company determined the estimated fair values of the intangible assets acquired using certain unobservable inputs in situations where observable inputs were not available. During the year ended December 31
 2020
 the Company acquired a controlling interest in PureCircle Limited (PureCircle) and accounted for the transaction as a business combination. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $68 million in intangible assets other than goodwill
 which pertains to customer relationships
 tradename
 and proprietary technology intangible assets relating to existing products and solutions (collectively
We identified the evaluation of the fair value of the intangible assets related to the PureCircle acquisition as a critical audit matter. A high degree of subjectivity and auditor judgment was required to evaluate certain valuation assumptions
 specifically the growth rates for certain future expected cash flows
 discount rates
 and royalty rates. In addition
 minor changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the intangible assets. 
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain controls related to the Company&#8217;s process for determining the fair value of the acquired intangible assets
 including controls related to the selection of certain assumptions used. We evaluated growth rates for certain future expected cash flows by comparing them to PureCircle&#8217;s historical performance and to industry data. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge
Growth rate assumptions for certain future expected cash flows used to value the intangible assets by comparing to peer companies or macro-economic trend data

Ingredion Incorporated (individually and together with its consolidated subsidiaries
 &#8220;the Company&#8221;) was founded in 1906 and became an independent and public company as of December 31
 1997. The Company primarily manufactures and sells sweeteners
 starches
 nutrition ingredients
 and biomaterial solutions derived from the wet milling and processing of corn and other starch-based materials to a wide range of industries
: The Consolidated Financial Statements consist of the accounts of the Company
The preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported
 disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities
 and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include the value of purchase consideration
 valuation of accounts receivable
 inventories
 goodwill
 intangible assets and other long-lived assets
 legal contingencies
 guarantee obligations
 and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes
 and pension and other postretirement benefits
 among others. These estimates and assumptions are based on management&#8217;s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors
 including the current economic environment
 which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management will adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Foreign currency devaluations versus the U.S. dollar
 corn price volatility
 access to credit markets
 and adverse changes in the global economic environment have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision
Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries
 other than those whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar
 are translated at current exchange rates with the related translation adjustments reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Income statement accounts are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. However
 significant non-recurring items related to a specific event are recognized at the exchange rate on the date of the significant event. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries in Mexico and as of July 1
 2018
 in Argentina. &#160;In the second quarter of the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Argentine peso rapidly devalued relative to the U.S. dollar
 which along with increased inflation

In testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment
 the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. After assessing the qualitative factors
 if the Company determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount
 then it would not be required to compute the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. In the event the qualitative assessment leads the Company to conclude otherwise
 then it would be required to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and perform a quantitative impairment test in accordance with ASC Topic 350-30
. In performing the qualitative analysis
 the Company considers various factors including net sales derived from these intangibles and certain market and industry conditions. Based on the results of its assessment
 the Company concluded that as of July 1
 2020
Subsequent to the Company&#8217;s annual assessment
 the Company identified an impairment indicator and recorded an impairment of $
In testing goodwill for impairment
 the Company first assesses qualitative factors in determining whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. After assessing the qualitative factors
 if the Company determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount
 then the Company does not perform an impairment test. If the Company concludes otherwise
 then the Company performs the impairment test as described in ASC Topic 350. Under this impairment test
 the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of its net assets
 goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit
 then an impairment exists for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the reporting unit. This difference is not to exceed the goodwill recorded at the reporting unit. Based on the results of the annual assessment
 the Company concluded that as of July 1
 2020
: The Company accounts for revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606
 
 Derivative financial instruments used by the Company consist of commodity futures and option contracts
 forward currency contracts and options
On the date a derivative contract is entered into
 the Company designates the derivative as a hedge of variable cash flows to be paid related certain forecasted transactions (&#8220;a cash flow hedge&#8221;)
 as a hedge of the fair value of certain firm commitments (&#8220;a fair value hedge&#8221;)
 or as a non-designated hedging instrument as defined by ASC 815
. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow or fair value hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
 or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. These hedges are accounted for using ASC Topic 815. For all hedging relationships
 the Company documents the hedging relationships and its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transactions
 the hedging instrument
 the hedged item
 the nature of the risk being hedged
 how the hedging instrument&#8217;s effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness. The Company also formally assesses both
 at the hedge&#8217;s inception and on an ongoing basis
 whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or has ceased to be a highly effective hedge
The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows or fair value of the hedged item
 the derivative is de-designated as a hedging instrument because it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur
 or management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued
 the Company continues to carry the derivative on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at its fair value
 and gains and losses that were included in AOCI are recognized in earnings in the same line item affected by the hedged transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings
 The Company has a stock incentive plan that provides for share-based employee compensation
 including the granting of stock options
 shares of restricted stock
 restricted stock units
 Basic earnings per common share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) is computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method
 computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of shares outstanding
 including the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and other instruments associated with long-term incentive compensation plans. 
 The Company operates domestically and internationally. In each country
 the business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty. The Company insures its business and assets in each country against insurable risks in a manner that it deems appropriate. Because of this geographic dispersion
 the Company believes that a loss from non-insurable events in any one country would not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s operations as a whole. Additionally
ASU No. 2017-04
In January 2017
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2017-04
. This ASU simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill as this ASU eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under this ASU
 an entity will continue to perform its annual
 or interim
 goodwill impairment test to determine if the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount. An entity should then recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value using the results of its Step 1 assessment
 with the loss recognized not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15

The Company applies the provisions of ASC 606-10
. The Company recognizes revenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of products to customers in an amount reflecting the consideration the Company expects to receive. In order to achieve that core principle
 the Company applies the following five-step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer
 (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract
 (3) determine the transaction price
 (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
The Company identified customer purchase orders
 which in some cases are governed by a master sales agreement
 as the contracts with its customers. For each contract
 the Company considers the transfer of products
 each of which is distinct
 to be the identified performance obligation. In determining the transaction price for the performance obligation
 the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to adjustment to determine the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled. The pricing model can be fixed or variable within the contract. The variable pricing model is based on historical commodity pricing and is determinable prior to completion of the performance obligation. Additionally

 over a period of time considered adequate to account for current pricing and business trends. Historically

&#160;2020 and 2019. &#160;The product price as specified in the contract
 net of any discounts
 is considered the standalone selling price as it is an observable input which depicts the price as if sold to a similar customer in similar circumstances. Payment is received shortly after the performance obligation is satisfied; therefore
Revenue is recognized when the Company&#8217;s performance obligation is satisfied and control is transferred to the customer
 which occurs at a point in time
 either upon delivery to an agreed upon location or to the customer. Further
 in 
determining whether control has transferred
 the Company considers if there is a present right to payment and legal title
 year or less. &#160;These costs primarily include the Company&#8217;s internal sales force compensation. Under the terms of these programs
From time to time the Company may enter into long-term contracts with its customers. Historically
 the contracts entered into by the Company do not result in significant contract assets or liabilities. &#160;Any such arrangements are accounted for in Other assets or Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. There were no significant contract assets or liabilities as of December&#160;31

NOTE 6 &#8211; Financial Instruments
The Company is exposed to market risk stemming from changes in commodity prices (primarily corn and natural gas)
 foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In the normal course of business
 the Company actively manages its exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions
 authorized under established policies that place controls on these activities. These transactions utilize exchange-traded derivatives or over-the-counter derivatives with investment grade counterparties. Derivative financial instruments currently used by the Company consist of commodity-related futures
 options
 and swap contracts
 foreign currency-related forward contracts
: The Company&#8217;s principal use of derivative financial instruments is to manage commodity price risk relating to anticipated purchases of corn and natural gas to be used in the manufacturing process
. The Company maintains a commodity-price risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to minimize significant
 unanticipated earnings fluctuations caused by commodity-price volatility. To manage price risk related to corn purchases primarily in North America
 the Company uses corn futures and option contracts that trade on regulated commodity exchanges to lock-in corn costs associated with fixed-priced customer sales contracts. The Company also uses over-the-counter natural gas swaps in North America to hedge a portion of its natural gas usage. These derivative financial instruments limit the impact that volatility resulting from fluctuations in market prices will have on corn and natural gas purchases. The Company&#8217;s natural gas derivatives and the majority of its corn derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedging instruments. 
The Company enters into certain corn derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments as defined by ASC 815
. Therefore

 or in the month a hedge is determined to be ineffective. The Company assesses the effectiveness of a commodity hedge contract based on changes in the contract&#8217;s fair value. The changes in the market value of such contracts have historically been
 and are expected to continue to be
As of December&#160;31
&#160;2020
 million bushels of corn
: Due to the its global operations
 including operations in many emerging markets
 the Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result
 the Company has exposure to translational foreign-exchange risk when the results of its foreign operations are translated to U.S. dollars and to transactional foreign-exchange risk when transactions not denominated in the functional currency are revalued. The Company&#8217;s foreign-exchange risk management strategy uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts
 swaps and options to manage its transactional foreign exchange risk. The Company enters into foreign currency derivative instruments that are designated as both cash flow hedging instruments as well as instruments not designated as hedging instruments as defined by ASC 815
 
The Company hedges certain assets using foreign currency derivatives not designated as hedging instruments

&#160;2020 and 2019
: The Company assesses its exposure to variability in interest rates by identifying and monitoring changes in interest rates that may adversely impact future cash flows and the fair value of existing debt instruments
The Company periodically enters into interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate changes. The changes in fair value of interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments that effectively offset the variability in the fair value of outstanding debt obligations are reported in earnings. These amounts offset the gains or losses (the changes in fair value) of the hedged debt instruments that are attributable to changes in interest rates (the hedged risk)
 which are also recognized in earnings. As of December 31
 2020
 the Company did not have any outstanding interest rate swaps. As of December 31

 to variable rates. The Company redeemed these notes in July 2020 and settled the outstanding interest rate swap.
The Company periodically enters into T-Locks to hedge its exposure to interest rate changes. The T-Locks are designated as hedges of the variability in cash flows associated with future interest payments caused by market fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate until the fixed interest rate is established
 and are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Accordingly
 changes in the fair value of the T-Locks are recorded to AOCI until the consummation of the underlying debt offering
 at which time any realized gain (loss) is amortized to earnings over the life of the debt. During the year ended December 31
 2020
 the Company entered into and settled T-Locks associated with the issuance of senior notes. The realized loss upon settlement of the T-Locks was recorded in AOCI and is amortized into earnings over the life of the senior notes. The Company did not have outstanding T-Locks as of December 31

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the agreement. Operating leases are included in operating lease assets
 and current and non-current operating lease liabilities in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Lease assets represent the Company&#8217;s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company&#8217;s leases do not provide an implicit rate
 the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease asset value includes in its calculation any prepaid lease payments made and any lease incentives received from the arrangement as a reduction of the asset. &#160;The Company&#8217;s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease
 and the impact of these options are included in the lease liability and lease asset calculations when the exercise of the option is at the Company&#8217;s sole discretion and it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company will not separate lease and non-lease components for its leases when it is impracticable to separate the two

Our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
 performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31
 2020. Based on that evaluation
 our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as a result of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below
 Ingredion&#39;s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31
Pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles accepted in the U.S.
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting
Management
 under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and the oversight of the Board of Directors
 conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
&#160; Based on the evaluation
 we identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to ineffective information technology general controls (&#8220;ITGCs&#8221;) related to user access over certain information technology (&#8220;IT&#8221;) systems. As a result
 our business process automated and manual controls that rely on information derived from the affected IT systems are dependent on the effective design and operation of ITGCs and are therefore also considered ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. These control deficiencies were the result of insufficient development of IT personnel as the control owners did not adequately understand the control objectives or the design of the control activity
The material weakness did not result in any identified misstatements to the consolidated financial statements and there were no changes to previously released financial results. However
 because the material weakness creates a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to our financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis
 we concluded that as December 31
 2020
Under guidelines established by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
 companies are allowed to exclude acquisitions from their first assessment of internal control over financial reporting following the date of the acquisition. Ingredion management excluded the acquisitions of PureCircle Limited
 which was completed on July 1
 2020
 and Verdient Foods
 which was completed on November 1
 2020
 from the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Total assets of $417 million and total net sales of $28 million associated with the acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements of Ingredion as of and for the year ended December 31
Our independent registered public accounting firm
 KPMG LLP
 who audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report
 issued an adverse report on the effectiveness of Ingredion&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2020
To remediate the material weakness described above
 Ingredion has been and will be implementing revised controls and processes that will include the following
 among others: (1) develop personnel by enhancing training for ITGC owners regarding their roles and responsibilities within the control objectives and activities; and (2) improve the documentation of the user access review control objective and related control activities
The material weakness will be considered remediated when management concludes that
 through testing
 the applicable remediated controls are designed
 implemented and operating effectively. We expect remediation of this material weakness will be completed during fiscal year 2021.
Other than the matters described above under &#8220;Management&#8217;s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting &#8211; Management&#8217;s Remediation Plan
&#8221; there have been no changes in Ingredion&#39;s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended) during the quarter ended December 30
 2020 that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect Ingredion&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting.
(the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December&#160;31
 2020
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion
 because of the effect of the material weakness
 described below
 on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria
 the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December&#160;31
 2020
We also have audited
 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)
 the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December&#160;31
 2020 and 2019
 the related consolidated statements of income
 comprehensive income
 equity and redeemable equity
 and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December&#160;31
 2020
 and the related notes (collectively
 the consolidated financial statements)
 and our report dated February 24
A material weakness is a deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company&#8217;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A material weakness related to the ineffective information technology general controls (&#8220;ITGCs&#8221;) related to user access over certain information technology (&#8220;IT&#8221;) systems has been identified and included in management&#8217;s assessment. As a result
 the business process automated and manual controls that rely on information derived from the affected IT systems are dependent on the effective design and operation of ITGCs and are therefore also considered ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. These control deficiencies were the result of insufficient development of IT personnel as the control owners did not adequately understand the control objectives or the design of the control activity
 as well as
 the result of ineffective timely communication of the control objective to these IT personnel by management. The material weakness was considered in determining the nature
 timing
 and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2020 consolidated financial statements
The Company acquired a controlling interest in PureCircle Limited and Verdient Foods during 2020
 and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December&#160;31
 2020
 PureCircle Limited&#8217;s and Verdient Foods&#8217; internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $417 million and total net sales of $28 million included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December&#160;31
The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
 included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
understanding of internal control over financial reporting
 assessing the risk that a material weakness exists
A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions

 on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2020
 expresses our opinion that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2020 because of the effect of a material weakness on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria and contains an explanatory paragraph that states that a material weakness has been identified and included in management&#8217;s assessment related to the ineffective information technology general controls (&#8220;ITGCs&#8221;) related to user access over certain information technology (&#8220;IT&#8221;) systems. As a result
 the business process automated and manual controls that rely on information derived from the affected IT systems are dependent on the effective design and operation of ITGCs and are therefore also considered ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. These control deficiencies were the result of insufficient development of IT personnel as the control owners did not adequately understand the control objectives or the design of the control activity

 among others. These estimates and assumptions are based on management&#x2019;s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors
 including the current economic environment
 which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management will adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Foreign currency devaluations versus the U.S. dollar
 corn price volatility
 access to credit markets
 and adverse changes in the global economic environment have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision

 significant non-recurring items related to a specific event are recognized at the exchange rate on the date of the significant event. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the Company&#x2019;s subsidiaries in Mexico and as of July 1

 in Argentina. &#160;In the second quarter of the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Argentine peso rapidly devalued relative to the U.S. dollar
 which along with increased inflation
 resulted in a three-year cumulative inflation that exceeded 100 percent
 as of June 30
 2018. &#160;As a result
 the Company elected to adopt hyperinflation accounting as of July 1
 2018

 the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. After assessing the qualitative factors
 if the Company determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount
 then it would not be required to compute the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. In the event the qualitative assessment leads the Company to conclude otherwise
 then it would be required to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and perform a quantitative impairment test in accordance with ASC Topic 350-30
 &lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;General Intangibles Other than Goodwill&lt;/i&gt;. In performing the qualitative analysis
 the Company considers various factors including net sales derived from these intangibles and certain market and industry conditions. Based on the results of its assessment
 the Company concluded that as of July 1

 the Company first assesses qualitative factors in determining whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. After assessing the qualitative factors
 if the Company determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount
 then the Company does not perform an impairment test. If the Company concludes otherwise
 then the Company performs the impairment test as described in ASC Topic 350. Under this impairment test
 the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of its net assets
 goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit
 then an impairment exists for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the reporting unit. This difference is not to exceed the goodwill recorded at the reporting unit. Based on the results of the annual assessment
 the Company concluded that as of July 1
 2020

 &lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&lt;/i&gt;

 forward currency contracts and options

 the Company designates the derivative as a hedge of variable cash flows to be paid related certain forecasted transactions (&#x201c;a cash flow hedge&#x201d;)
 as a hedge of the fair value of certain firm commitments (&#x201c;a fair value hedge&#x201d;)
 or as a non-designated hedging instrument as defined by ASC 815
 &lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;Derivatives and Hedging&lt;/i&gt;. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow or fair value hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
 or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. These hedges are accounted for using ASC Topic 815. For all hedging relationships
 the Company documents the hedging relationships and its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transactions
 the hedging instrument
 the hedged item
 the nature of the risk being hedged
 how the hedging instrument&#x2019;s effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness. The Company also formally assesses both
 at the hedge&#x2019;s inception and on an ongoing basis
 whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or has ceased to be a highly effective hedge

 the derivative is de-designated as a hedging instrument because it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur
 or management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued
 the Company continues to carry the derivative on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at its fair value
 and gains and losses that were included in AOCI are recognized in earnings in the same line item affected by the hedged transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings

 including the granting of stock options
 shares of restricted stock
 restricted stock units

 computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of shares outstanding

 the business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty. The Company insures its business and assets in each country against insurable risks in a manner that it deems appropriate. Because of this geographic dispersion
 the Company believes that a loss from non-insurable events in any one country would not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#x2019;s operations as a whole. Additionally


 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&#x201c;ASU&#x201d;) No. 2017-04
 &lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;Intangibles &#x2013; Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment&lt;/i&gt;. This ASU simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill as this ASU eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under this ASU
 an entity will continue to perform its annual
 or interim
 goodwill impairment test to determine if the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount. An entity should then recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&#x2019;s fair value using the results of its Step 1 assessment
 with the loss recognized not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2019


 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13
 &lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments&lt;/i&gt;
 which requires the Company to measure and recognize expected credit losses for financial assets held and not accounted for at fair value through net income. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2019
 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 at the beginning of its 2020 fiscal year


 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 &lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;Leases (Topic 842)&lt;/i&gt;
 which supersedes Topic 840
 &lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;Leases&lt;/i&gt;. The Company adopted this updated standard as of January 1
 2019
 using the modified retrospective approach and the effective date as its date of initial application. The Company elected the package of three practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance
 which among other things allowed the Company to carry forward the historical lease classification of existing leases and to not reassess expired contracts for leases. &#160;The practical expedient for hindsight to determine lease term was not elected by the Company. &#160;The standard resulted in the initial recognition of $170 million of &lt;span style=-sec-ix-hidden:Hidden_I3B3gyQYpkW1m8cljjh6Kg;&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:justify;&gt;total operating lease liabilities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and $161 million of operating lease assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on January 1

This Update modifies accounting guidance for hedge accounting by making more hedge strategies eligible for hedge accounting
 amending presentation and disclosure requirements
 and changing how companies assess ineffectiveness. The intent is to simplify the application of hedge accounting and increase transparency of information about an entity&#x2019;s risk management activities. The amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2018
 with early adoption permitted. &#160;The Company completed its assessment of these updates adopted on January 1

 including the current economic environment
 which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management will adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Foreign currency devaluations versus the U.S. dollar
 corn price volatility

 significant non-recurring items related to a specific event are recognized at the exchange rate on the date of the significant event. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the Company&#x2019;s subsidiaries in Mexico and as of July 1
 2018
 in Argentina. &#160;In the second quarter of the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Argentine peso rapidly devalued relative to the U.S. dollar
 which along with increased inflation
 resulted in a three-year cumulative inflation that exceeded 100 percent
 as of June 30
 2018. &#160;As a result
 the Company elected to adopt hyperinflation accounting as of July 1
 2018
 for its Argentina affiliate in accordance with GAAP. &#160;Under hyperinflation accounting
 the Argentina affiliate&#x2019;s functional currency becomes the U.S. dollar. &#160;For foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency

 plant and equipment (&#x201c;PP&amp;amp;E&#x201d;) are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets
 which range from 25 to 50 years for buildings and from &lt;span style=-sec-ix-hidden:Hidden_q0RahoIGoU-Koke4CcLPPA;&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:justify;&gt;two&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to 25 years for all other assets. Where permitted by law
 accelerated depreciation methods are used for tax purposes. The Company recognized depreciation expense of $183 million
 $191 million
 and $217 million for the years ended December&#160;31
&#160;2020
 2019
 and 2018
 respectively. The Company reviews the recoverability of the net book value of PP&amp;amp;E for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If this review indicates that the carrying values will not be recovered
 the carrying values would be reduced to fair value and an impairment loss would be recognized. As required under GAAP
 the impairment analysis for long-lived assets occurs before the goodwill impairment assessment described below. No PP&amp;amp;E impairment was recognized in the year ended December 31

 the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. After assessing the qualitative factors
 if the Company determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount

 forward currency contracts and options

 the Company designates the derivative as a hedge of variable cash flows to be paid related certain forecasted transactions (&#x201c;a cash flow hedge&#x201d;)
 as a hedge of the fair value of certain firm commitments (&#x201c;a fair value hedge&#x201d;)
 or as a non-designated hedging instrument as defined by ASC 815
 &lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;Derivatives and Hedging&lt;/i&gt;. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow or fair value hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
 or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. These hedges are accounted for using ASC Topic 815. For all hedging relationships
 the Company documents the hedging relationships and its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transactions
 the hedging instrument
 the hedged item
 the nature of the risk being hedged
 how the hedging instrument&#x2019;s effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness. The Company also formally assesses both
 at the hedge&#x2019;s inception and on an ongoing basis
 whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or has ceased to be a highly effective hedge

 the derivative is de-designated as a hedging instrument because it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur
 or management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued
 the Company continues to carry the derivative on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at its fair value
 and gains and losses that were included in AOCI are recognized in earnings in the same line item affected by the hedged transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings

 the business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty. The Company insures its business and assets in each country against insurable risks in a manner that it deems appropriate. Because of this geographic dispersion
 the Company believes that a loss from non-insurable events in any one country would not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#x2019;s operations as a whole. Additionally

 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&#x201c;ASU&#x201d;) No. 2017-04
 &lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;Intangibles &#x2013; Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment&lt;/i&gt;. This ASU simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill as this ASU eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under this ASU
 an entity will continue to perform its annual
 or interim
 goodwill impairment test to determine if the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount. An entity should then recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&#x2019;s fair value using the results of its Step 1 assessment
 with the loss recognized not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2019


 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13
 &lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments&lt;/i&gt;
 which requires the Company to measure and recognize expected credit losses for financial assets held and not accounted for at fair value through net income. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2019
 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 at the beginning of its 2020 fiscal year


 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 &lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;Leases (Topic 842)&lt;/i&gt;
 which supersedes Topic 840
 &lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;Leases&lt;/i&gt;. The Company adopted this updated standard as of January 1
 2019
 using the modified retrospective approach and the effective date as its date of initial application. The Company elected the package of three practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance
 which among other things allowed the Company to carry forward the historical lease classification of existing leases and to not reassess expired contracts for leases. &#160;The practical expedient for hindsight to determine lease term was not elected by the Company. &#160;The standard resulted in the initial recognition of $170 million of &lt;span style=-sec-ix-hidden:Hidden_I3B3gyQYpkW1m8cljjh6Kg;&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:justify;&gt;total operating lease liabilities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and $161 million of operating lease assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on January 1

 except for goodwill
 contingent liabilities
 and taxes
 which were preliminarily recorded based on information and incorporating management&#x2019;s best estimates. Contingent liabilities and taxes remain preliminary pending receipt of certain information required to finalize the determination of fair value. &#160;The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction are generally recorded at their estimated acquisition date fair values






 tradenames
 and proprietary technology. The fair values of these intangible assets were determined to be Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for an asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available
 thereby allowing for fair value estimates to be made in situations in which there is little
 if any
 market activity for an asset or liability at the measurement date. For more information on the fair value hierarchy

 which it funded from cash on hand. The results of the acquired operation are included in the Company&#x2019;s consolidated results from the acquisition date within the North America business segment. A preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was made based on available information and incorporating management&#x2019;s best estimates.

 &lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&lt;/i&gt;. The Company recognizes revenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of products to customers in an amount reflecting the consideration the Company expects to receive. In order to achieve that core principle
 the Company applies the following five-step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer
 (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract
 (3) determine the transaction price
 (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract

 which in some cases are governed by a master sales agreement
 as the contracts with its customers. For each contract
 the Company considers the transfer of products
 each of which is distinct
 to be the identified performance obligation. In determining the transaction price for the performance obligation
 the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to adjustment to determine the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled. The pricing model can be fixed or variable within the contract. The variable pricing model is based on historical commodity pricing and is determinable prior to completion of the performance obligation. Additionally
 the Company has certain sales adjustments for volume incentive discounts and other discount arrangements that reduce the transaction price. The reduction of transaction price is estimated using &lt;span style=font-family:'inherit';&gt;the expected value method based on an analysis of historical volume incentives or discounts
 over a period of time considered adequate to account for current pricing and business trends. Historically
 actual volume incentives and discounts relative to those estimated and included&lt;/span&gt; when determining the transaction price have not materially differed. Volume incentives and discounts are accrued at the satisfaction of the performance obligation and accounted for in Accounts payable and Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts are not significant as of December&#160;31
&#160;2020 and 2019. &#160;The product price as specified in the contract
 net of any discounts
 is considered the standalone selling price as it is an observable input which depicts the price as if sold to a similar customer in similar circumstances. Payment is received shortly after the performance obligation is satisfied; therefore

 which occurs at a point in time
 either upon delivery to an agreed upon location or to the customer. Further
 in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:justify;margin:0pt;&gt;determining whether control has transferred
 the Company considers if there is a present right to payment and legal title


 the contracts entered into by the Company do not result in significant contract assets or liabilities. &#160;Any such arrangements are accounted for in Other assets or Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. There were no significant contract assets or liabilities as of December&#160;31
&#160;2020

 and is managed geographically on a regional basis. The Company&#x2019;s operations are classified into four reportable business segments: North America
 South America
 Asia-Pacific and Europe
 Middle East and Africa (&#x201c;EMEA&#x201d;). &#160;The nature

 and current and non-current operating lease liabilities in the Company&#x2019;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Lease assets represent the Company&#x2019;s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company&#x2019;s leases do not provide an implicit rate
 the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease asset value includes in its calculation any prepaid lease payments made and any lease incentives received from the arrangement as a reduction of the asset. &#160;The Company&#x2019;s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease
 and the impact of these options are included in the lease liability and lease asset calculations when the exercise of the option is at the Company&#x2019;s sole discretion and it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company will not separate lease and non-lease components for its leases when it is impracticable to separate the two

 office space
 warehouses
 and machinery and equipment. &#160;The commencement date used for the calculation of the lease obligations recorded is the latter of the commencement date of the new standard (January 1
 2019) or the lease start date. &#160;Certain of the leases have options to extend the life of the lease





 right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities resulted in the initial recognition of $161 million operating lease assets during the year ended December 31
 2019. The standard adoption also resulted in the initial recognition of $170 million of total operating lease liabilities during the year ended December 31

 approximately $12 million are for state loss carryforwards and approximately $20 million are for foreign loss carryforwards. Of the $24 million of tax-effected net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31
 2019
 approximately $9 million are for state loss carryforwards and approximately $15 million are for foreign loss carryforwards. Income tax accounting requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment
 management considers the level of historical taxable income
 scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 tax planning strategies
 tax carryovers and projected future taxable income. As of December 31
 2020
 the Company maintained valuation allowances of $12 million for state loss carryforwards
 $4 million for state credits
 $1 million for state Internal Revenue Code section 163(j) limitations
 $5 million for foreign tax credits and $6 million for foreign loss carryforwards
 all of which management has determined will more likely than not expire prior to realization. As of December 31
 2019
 the Company maintained valuation allowances of $9 million for state loss carryforwards
 $4 million for state credits
 $1 million for state Internal Revenue Code section 163(j) limitations
 $1 million for foreign tax credits and $13 million for foreign loss carryforwards all of which management has determined will more likely than not expire prior to realization. In addition
 the Company maintains valuation allowances on foreign subsidiaries&#x2019; net deferred tax assets of $2 million and $1 million

 the Company&#x2019;s Brazilian subsidiary received a favorable decision from the Federal Court of Appeals in Sao Paulo
 Brazil
 related to certain indirect taxes collected in prior years. The Company finalized its calculation of the amount of the credits and interest due from the favorable decision
 concluding that the Company could be entitled to approximately $66 million of credits spanning a period from 2005 to 2018. The Department of Federal Revenue of Brazil
 however
 issued an Internal Ruling in which it charged that the Company is entitled to only $22 million of the calculated indirect tax credits and interest for the period from 2005 to 2014. The Brazil National Treasury filed a motion for clarification with the Brazilian Supreme Court
 asking the Court
 among other things
 to modify the lower court&#x2019;s decision to approve the Internal Ruling
 which could impact the decision in favor of the Company. To account for the judgment
 the Company recorded a $22 million pre-tax benefit in the Consolidated Income Statement in Other income
 in accordance with ASC 450
 &lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;Contingencies&lt;/i&gt; for the year ended December 31

 2020
 the Company received another favorable court judgment that clarified the calculation of the Company&#x2019;s benefit
 allowing the Company to claim the gross treatment within the indirect tax claim calculation and a larger indirect tax claim against the government. As a result of the decision
 the Company recorded an additional $35 million pre-tax benefit in the Consolidated Income Statement in Other income for the year ended December 31
 2020
 related to the open period of 2005 to 2014.  The total benefit recorded represents the Company&#x2019;s current estimate of the credits and interest due from the favorable decisions in accordance with ASC 450
 &lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;Contingencies. &lt;/i&gt;The Company is awaiting final court ruling for the period of 2015 to 2018


 during the twelve months ended December 31
 2020

 including labor matters
 certain environmental proceedings

The outcomes of these matters are not within the Company&#x2019;s complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. The Company does not believe that the results of currently known legal proceedings and inquires will be material to it. There can be no assurance
 however
 that such claims
 suits or investigations or those arising in the future
 whether taken individually or in the aggregate

 2021
 the Company signed an agreement with an affiliate of Grupo Arcor
 an Argentine food company
 to establish a joint venture to combine manufacturing operations in Argentina in order to sell value-added ingredients to customers in Argentina
 Chile and Uruguay. The joint venture will be 51% owned by an affiliate of Grupo Arcor and 49% owned by an affiliate of Ingredion. The joint venture will operate five manufacturing facilities located in the districts of Chacabuco and Baradero (Province of Buenos Aires)
 in Lules (Province of Tucum&#xe1;n)
 and in the Industrial Complex Arroyito (Province of C&#xf3;rdoba)
 of which the two manufacturing facilities located in Chacabuco and Baradero are being contributed by Ingredion Argentina and the remaining three manufacturing facilities are being contributed by an affiliate of Grupo Arcor. The manufacturing facilities collectively produce value-added ingredients including glucose syrups
 maltose
 fructose
 starch
 and maltodextrins
 among others
 that are marketed to the food
 beverage
 pharmaceutical and other industries. The joint venture will be managed by a jointly-appointed team of executives. Subject to the satisfaction of regulatory approvals and other closing conditions

 2021
 the Company&#x2019;s Board of Directors approved the contribution by three of Ingredion&#x2019;s South American subsidiaries of their net assets to the joint venture. The Board&#x2019;s approval results in held-for-sale treatment of these net assets and an impairment charge in the estimated range of $350 million to $370 million
 of which $310 million related to the write-off of cumulative translation adjustment in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $40 million to $60 million related to the write-down of the contributed net assets
 consisting primarily of plant
 property and equipment
 including two manufacturing facilities
 and related operating assets. &#160;The impairment charge is subject to finalization of ending balances and foreign exchange impacts. The impairment charge will not result in any cash expenditures. The impairment will be recorded in the Company&#x2019;s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of and for the quarter ending March 31

: The Consolidated Financial Statements consist of the accounts of the Company
The preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported
 disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities
 and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include the value of purchase consideration
 valuation of accounts receivable
 inventories
 goodwill
 intangible assets and other long-lived assets
 legal contingencies
 guarantee obligations
 and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes
 and pension and other postretirement benefits
 among others. These estimates and assumptions are based on management&#8217;s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors
 including the current economic environment
 which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management will adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Foreign currency devaluations versus the U.S. dollar
 corn price volatility
 access to credit markets
 and adverse changes in the global economic environment have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision
Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries
 other than those whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar
 are translated at current exchange rates with the related translation adjustments reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Income statement accounts are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. However
 significant non-recurring items related to a specific event are recognized at the exchange rate on the date of the significant event. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries in Mexico and as of July 1
 2018
 in Argentina. &#160;In the second quarter of the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Argentine peso rapidly devalued relative to the U.S. dollar
 which along with increased inflation
 resulted in a three-year cumulative inflation that exceeded 100 percent
 as of June 30
 2018. &#160;As a result
 the Company elected to adopt hyperinflation accounting as of July 1
 2018
 for its Argentina affiliate in accordance with GAAP. &#160;Under hyperinflation accounting
 the Argentina affiliate&#8217;s functional currency becomes the U.S. dollar. &#160;For foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency

 but do not represent a controlling interest
 are accounted for under the equity method; such investments are carried at cost

 accelerated depreciation methods are used for tax purposes. The Company recognized depreciation expense of $183 million
 $191 million
 and $217 million for the years ended December&#160;31
&#160;2020

 the carrying values would be reduced to fair value and an impairment loss would be recognized. As required under GAAP
 the impairment analysis for long-lived assets occurs before the goodwill impairment assessment described below. No PP&amp;E impairment was recognized in the year ended December 31

 $29 million
 and $30 million for the years ended December 31
 2020
 2019

The Company reviews the recoverability of the net book value of definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If this review indicates that the carrying values will not be recovered
Based on acquisitions completed through December&#160;31

In testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment
 the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. After assessing the qualitative factors
 if the Company determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount
 then it would not be required to compute the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. In the event the qualitative assessment leads the Company to conclude otherwise
 then it would be required to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and perform a quantitative impairment test in accordance with ASC Topic 350-30
. In performing the qualitative analysis
 the Company considers various factors including net sales derived from these intangibles and certain market and industry conditions. Based on the results of its assessment
 the Company concluded that as of July 1
 2020
Subsequent to the Company&#8217;s annual assessment
In testing goodwill for impairment
 the Company first assesses qualitative factors in determining whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. After assessing the qualitative factors
 if the Company determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount
 then the Company does not perform an impairment test. If the Company concludes otherwise
 then the Company performs the impairment test as described in ASC Topic 350. Under this impairment test
 the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of its net assets
 goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit
 then an impairment exists for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the reporting unit. This difference is not to exceed the goodwill recorded at the reporting unit. Based on the results of the annual assessment
 the Company concluded that as of July 1
 2020
: The Company accounts for revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606
 
 Derivative financial instruments used by the Company consist of commodity futures and option contracts
 forward currency contracts and options
On the date a derivative contract is entered into
 the Company designates the derivative as a hedge of variable cash flows to be paid related certain forecasted transactions (&#8220;a cash flow hedge&#8221;)
 as a hedge of the fair value of certain firm commitments (&#8220;a fair value hedge&#8221;)
 or as a non-designated hedging instrument as defined by ASC 815
. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow or fair value hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
 or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. These hedges are accounted for using ASC Topic 815. For all hedging relationships
 the Company documents the hedging relationships and its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transactions
 the hedging instrument
 the hedged item
 the nature of the risk being hedged
 how the hedging instrument&#8217;s effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness. The Company also formally assesses both
 at the hedge&#8217;s inception and on an ongoing basis
 whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or has ceased to be a highly effective hedge
The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows or fair value of the hedged item
 the derivative is de-designated as a hedging instrument because it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur
 or management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued
 the Company continues to carry the derivative on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at its fair value
 and gains and losses that were included in AOCI are recognized in earnings in the same line item affected by the hedged transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings
 The Company has a stock incentive plan that provides for share-based employee compensation
 including the granting of stock options
 shares of restricted stock
 restricted stock units
 Basic earnings per common share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) is computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method
 computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of shares outstanding
 The Company operates domestically and internationally. In each country
 the business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty. The Company insures its business and assets in each country against insurable risks in a manner that it deems appropriate. Because of this geographic dispersion
 the Company believes that a loss from non-insurable events in any one country would not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s operations as a whole. Additionally
ASU No. 2017-04
In January 2017
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2017-04
. This ASU simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill as this ASU eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under this ASU
 an entity will continue to perform its annual
 or interim
 goodwill impairment test to determine if the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount. An entity should then recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value using the results of its Step 1 assessment
 with the loss recognized not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2019
ASU No. 2016-13
In June 2016

 which requires the Company to measure and recognize expected credit losses for financial assets held and not accounted for at fair value through net income. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2019
 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 at the beginning of its 2020 fiscal year
ASU No. 2016-02

ASU No. 2017-12 and ASU 2018-16

 amending presentation and disclosure requirements
 and changing how companies assess ineffectiveness. The intent is to simplify the application of hedge accounting and increase transparency of information about an entity&#8217;s risk management activities. The amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2018
 with early adoption permitted. &#160;The Company completed its assessment of these updates adopted on January 1

The Company applies the provisions of ASC 606-10
. The Company recognizes revenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of products to customers in an amount reflecting the consideration the Company expects to receive. In order to achieve that core principle
 the Company applies the following five-step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer
 (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract
 (3) determine the transaction price
 (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
The Company identified customer purchase orders
 which in some cases are governed by a master sales agreement
 as the contracts with its customers. For each contract
 the Company considers the transfer of products
 each of which is distinct
 to be the identified performance obligation. In determining the transaction price for the performance obligation
 the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to adjustment to determine the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled. The pricing model can be fixed or variable within the contract. The variable pricing model is based on historical commodity pricing and is determinable prior to completion of the performance obligation. Additionally

 over a period of time considered adequate to account for current pricing and business trends. Historically

&#160;2020 and 2019. &#160;The product price as specified in the contract
 net of any discounts
 is considered the standalone selling price as it is an observable input which depicts the price as if sold to a similar customer in similar circumstances. Payment is received shortly after the performance obligation is satisfied; therefore
Revenue is recognized when the Company&#8217;s performance obligation is satisfied and control is transferred to the customer
 which occurs at a point in time
 either upon delivery to an agreed upon location or to the customer. Further
determining whether control has transferred
 the Company considers if there is a present right to payment and legal title
Shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers represent fulfillment costs and are recorded in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers are accounted for on a net basis and excluded from net sales. &#160;The Company applies a practical expedient to expense costs to obtain a contract as incurred as most contracts are one year or less. &#160;These costs primarily include the Company&#8217;s internal sales force compensation. Under the terms of these programs
From time to time the Company may enter into long-term contracts with its customers. Historically
 the contracts entered into by the Company do not result in significant contract assets or liabilities. &#160;Any such arrangements are accounted for in Other assets or Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. There were no significant contract assets or liabilities as of December&#160;31
&#160;2020
The Company is principally engaged in the production and sale of starches and sweeteners for a wide range of industries
 and is managed geographically on a regional basis. The Company&#8217;s operations are classified into four reportable business segments: North America
 South America
 Asia-Pacific and Europe

 Derivatives and Hedging Activities




Financial Instruments
 Derivatives and Hedging Activities
NOTE 6 &#8211; Financial Instruments
The Company is exposed to market risk stemming from changes in commodity prices (primarily corn and natural gas)
 foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In the normal course of business
 the Company actively manages its exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions
 authorized under established policies that place controls on these activities. These transactions utilize exchange-traded derivatives or over-the-counter derivatives with investment grade counterparties. Derivative financial instruments currently used by the Company consist of commodity-related futures
 options
 and swap contracts
 foreign currency-related forward contracts
: The Company&#8217;s principal use of derivative financial instruments is to manage commodity price risk relating to anticipated purchases of corn and natural gas to be used in the manufacturing process
. The Company maintains a commodity-price risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to minimize significant
 unanticipated earnings fluctuations caused by commodity-price volatility. To manage price risk related to corn purchases primarily in North America
The Company enters into certain corn derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments as defined by ASC 815
. Therefore
For commodity hedges designated as cash flow hedges
and included in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as part of AOCI. These amounts are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same line item affected by the hedged transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings
 or in the month a hedge is determined to be ineffective. The Company assesses the effectiveness of a commodity hedge contract based on changes in the contract&#8217;s fair value. The changes in the market value of such contracts have historically been
 and are expected to continue to be
As of December&#160;31

 million bushels of corn
: Due to the its global operations
 including operations in many emerging markets
 the Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result
 the Company has exposure to translational foreign-exchange risk when the results of its foreign operations are translated to U.S. dollars and to transactional foreign-exchange risk when transactions not denominated in the functional currency are revalued. The Company&#8217;s foreign-exchange risk management strategy uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts
 swaps and options to manage its transactional foreign exchange risk. The Company enters into foreign currency derivative instruments that are designated as both cash flow hedging instruments as well as instruments not designated as hedging instruments as defined by ASC 815
 
The Company hedges certain assets using foreign currency derivatives not designated as hedging instruments
 million as of December 31
 2020 and December 31
 2019
 respectively. The Company also hedges certain liabilities using foreign currency derivatives not designated as hedging instruments

&#160;2020 and 2019
The Company hedges certain assets using foreign currency cash flow hedging instruments

 2019
 respectively. The Company also hedges certain liability positions using foreign currency cash flow hedging instruments

&#160;2020 and 2019
: The Company assesses its exposure to variability in interest rates by identifying and monitoring changes in interest rates that may adversely impact future cash flows and the fair value of existing debt instruments
The Company periodically enters into interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate changes. The changes in fair value of interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments that effectively offset the variability in the fair value of outstanding debt obligations are reported in earnings. These amounts offset the gains or losses (the changes in fair value) of the hedged debt instruments that are attributable to changes in interest rates (the hedged risk)
 which are also recognized in earnings. As of December 31
 2020
 the Company did not have any outstanding interest rate swaps. As of December 31
 2019
 the Company had an outstanding interest rate swap agreement that converted the interest rates on $200 million of its $400 million 4.625% senior notes due November 1
 2020
The Company periodically enters into T-Locks to hedge its exposure to interest rate changes. The T-Locks are designated as hedges of the variability in cash flows associated with future interest payments caused by market fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate until the fixed interest rate is established
 and are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Accordingly
 changes in the fair value of the T-Locks are recorded to AOCI until the consummation of the underlying debt offering
 at which time any realized gain (loss) is amortized to earnings over the life of the debt. During the year ended December 31
 2020
 the Company entered into and settled T-Locks associated with the issuance of senior notes. The realized loss upon settlement of the T-Locks was recorded in AOCI and is amortized into earnings over the life of the senior notes. The Company did not have outstanding T-Locks as of December 31

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the agreement. Operating leases are included in operating lease assets
 and current and non-current operating lease liabilities in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Lease assets represent the Company&#8217;s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company&#8217;s leases do not provide an implicit rate
 the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease asset value includes in its calculation any prepaid lease payments made and any lease incentives received from the arrangement as a reduction of the asset. &#160;The Company&#8217;s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease
 and the impact of these options are included in the lease liability and lease asset calculations when the exercise of the option is at the Company&#8217;s sole discretion and it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company will not separate lease and non-lease components for its leases when it is impracticable to separate the two
The Company has operating leases for certain rail cars

 warehouses
 and machinery and equipment. &#160;The commencement date used for the calculation of the lease obligations recorded is the latter of the commencement date of the new standard (January 1

In January 2019
 the Company&#8217;s Brazilian subsidiary received a favorable decision from the Federal Court of Appeals in Sao Paulo
 Brazil
 related to certain indirect taxes collected in prior years. The Company finalized its calculation of the amount of the credits and interest due from the favorable decision
 concluding that the Company could be entitled to approximately $66 million of credits spanning a period from 2005 to 2018. The Department of Federal Revenue of Brazil
 however
 issued an Internal Ruling in which it charged that the Company is entitled to only $22 million of the calculated indirect tax credits and interest for the period from 2005 to 2014. The Brazil National Treasury filed a motion for clarification with the Brazilian Supreme Court
 asking the Court
 among other things
 to modify the lower court&#8217;s decision to approve the Internal Ruling
 which could impact the decision in favor of the Company. To account for the judgment
 the Company recorded a $22 million pre-tax benefit in the Consolidated Income Statement in Other income
 in accordance with ASC 450
 for the year ended December 31
During the year ended December 31
 2020
 the Company received another favorable court judgment that clarified the calculation of the Company&#8217;s benefit
 allowing the Company to claim the gross treatment within the indirect tax claim calculation and a larger indirect tax claim against the government. As a result of the decision
 the Company recorded an additional $35 million pre-tax benefit in the Consolidated Income Statement in Other income for the year ended December 31
 2020
 related to the open period of 2005 to 2014.  The total benefit recorded represents the Company&#8217;s current estimate of the credits and interest due from the favorable decisions in accordance with ASC 450
The Company is awaiting final court ruling for the period of 2015 to 2018
The Company expects to use the indirect tax credits of $57 million (from the period of 2005 to 2014) to offset its Brazilian federal tax payments beginning in 2021. The $57 million of future tax credits are recorded in Other assets and Prepaid expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
Additionally
 during the twelve months ended December 31
 2020
The Company is currently subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business
 including labor matters
 certain environmental proceedings
 and other commercial claims. &#160;The Company also routinely receives inquiries from regulators and other government authorities relating to various aspects of its business
 including with respect to compliance with laws and regulations relating to the environment

The outcomes of these matters are not within the Company&#8217;s complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. The Company does not believe that the results of currently known legal proceedings and inquires will be material to it. There can be no assurance
 however
 that such claims
 suits or investigations or those arising in the future
 whether taken individually or in the aggregate
 will not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition or results of operations.

On February 12
 2021
 the Company signed an agreement with an affiliate of Grupo Arcor
 an Argentine food company
 to establish a joint venture to combine manufacturing operations in Argentina in order to sell value-added ingredients to customers in Argentina
 Chile and Uruguay. The joint venture will be 51% owned by an affiliate of Grupo Arcor and 49% owned by an affiliate of Ingredion. The joint venture will operate five manufacturing facilities located in the districts of Chacabuco and Baradero (Province of Buenos Aires)
 in Lules (Province of Tucum&#225;n)
 and in the Industrial Complex Arroyito (Province of C&#243;rdoba)
 of which the two manufacturing facilities located in Chacabuco and Baradero are being contributed by Ingredion Argentina and the remaining three manufacturing facilities are being contributed by an affiliate of Grupo Arcor. The manufacturing facilities collectively produce value-added ingredients including glucose syrups
 maltose
 fructose
 starch
 and maltodextrins
 among others
 that are marketed to the food
 beverage
 pharmaceutical and other industries. The joint venture will be managed by a jointly-appointed team of executives. Subject to the satisfaction of regulatory approvals and other closing conditions
On February 9
 2021
 the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approved the contribution by three of Ingredion&#8217;s South American subsidiaries of their net assets to the joint venture. The Board&#8217;s approval results in held-for-sale treatment of these net assets and an impairment charge in the estimated range of $350 million to $370 million
 of which $310 million related to the write-off of cumulative translation adjustment in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $40 million to $60 million related to the write-down of the contributed net assets
 consisting primarily of plant
 property and equipment
 including two manufacturing facilities
 and related operating assets. &#160;The impairment charge is subject to finalization of ending balances and foreign exchange impacts. The impairment charge will not result in any cash expenditures. The impairment will be recorded in the Company&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of and for the quarter ending March 31
 2021. &#160;

: The Consolidated Financial Statements consist of the accounts of the Company
The preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported
 disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities
 and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include the value of purchase consideration
 valuation of accounts receivable
 inventories
 goodwill
 intangible assets and other long-lived assets
 legal contingencies
 guarantee obligations
 and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes
 and pension and other postretirement benefits
 among others. These estimates and assumptions are based on management&#8217;s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors
 including the current economic environment
 which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management will adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Foreign currency devaluations versus the U.S. dollar
 corn price volatility
 access to credit markets
 and adverse changes in the global economic environment have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision
Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries
 other than those whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar
 are translated at current exchange rates with the related translation adjustments reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Income statement accounts are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. However
 significant non-recurring items related to a specific event are recognized at the exchange rate on the date of the significant event. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries in Mexico and as of July 1
 2018
 in Argentina. &#160;In the second quarter of the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Argentine peso rapidly devalued relative to the U.S. dollar
 which along with increased inflation
 resulted in a three-year cumulative inflation that exceeded 100 percent
 as of June 30
 2018. &#160;As a result
 the Company elected to adopt hyperinflation accounting as of July 1
 2018
 for its Argentina affiliate in accordance with GAAP. &#160;Under hyperinflation accounting
 the Argentina affiliate&#8217;s functional currency becomes the U.S. dollar. &#160;For foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency
 monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates with the related adjustment included in net income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates. 




 Cash equivalents consist of all instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less
 and which have virtually no risk of loss in value.



Accounts receivable
 net
Accounts receivable
 net
 net
 consist of trade and other receivables carried at approximate fair value
 net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. &#160;The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using the Company&#8217;s best estimate of expected credit losses using historical experience and current and future economic conditions.









 &#160;Investments are included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. &#160;The Company holds equity and cost method investments
 and marketable securities as of December 31
Investments in which the Company is able to exercise significant influence
 but do not represent a controlling interest
 are accounted for under the equity method; such investments are carried at cost
loss
 less dividends received. Investments in the common stock of affiliated companies over which the Company does not exercise significant influence are accounted for under the cost method. The marketable securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded to Other income
 net in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 825




The Company leases rail cars
 office space
 and certain machinery and equipment. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the agreement and classifies its leases based on the terms of the related lease agreement and the criteria contained in Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) ASC Topic 842
 
 and related interpretations. See also Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.



Property
 plant and equipment and depreciation
Property
Property
 plant and equipment (&#8220;PP&amp;E&#8221;) are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets
 to 25 years for all other assets. Where permitted by law
 accelerated depreciation methods are used for tax purposes. The Company recognized depreciation expense of $183 million
 $191 million
 and $217 million for the years ended December&#160;31
&#160;2020
 2019
 and 2018
 respectively. The Company reviews the recoverability of the net book value of PP&amp;E for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If this review indicates that the carrying values will not be recovered
 the carrying values would be reduced to fair value and an impairment loss would be recognized. As required under GAAP
 the impairment analysis for long-lived assets occurs before the goodwill impairment assessment described below. No PP&amp;E impairment was recognized in the year ended December 31

Goodwill ($902 million and $801 million at December&#160;31
&#160;2020 and 2019
 respectively) represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value assigned to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company also has other intangible assets of $444 million and $437 million at December&#160;31
&#160;2020 and 2019

Definite-lived intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of definite-lived intangible assets. Amortization expense related to intangible assets was $30 million
 $29 million
 and $30 million for the years ended December 31
 2020
 2019
 and 2018
 respectively. The Company reviews the recoverability of the net book value of definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If this review indicates that the carrying values will not be recovered
Based on acquisitions completed through December&#160;31
&#160;2020
In testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment
 the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. After assessing the qualitative factors
 if the Company determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount
 then it would not be required to compute the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. In the event the qualitative assessment leads the Company to conclude otherwise
 then it would be required to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and perform a quantitative impairment test in accordance with ASC Topic 350-30
. In performing the qualitative analysis
 the Company considers various factors including net sales derived from these intangibles and certain market and industry conditions. Based on the results of its assessment
 the Company concluded that as of July 1
 2020
Subsequent to the Company&#8217;s annual assessment
In testing goodwill for impairment
 the Company first assesses qualitative factors in determining whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. After assessing the qualitative factors
 if the Company determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount
 then the Company does not perform an impairment test. If the Company concludes otherwise
 then the Company performs the impairment test as described in ASC Topic 350. Under this impairment test
 the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of its net assets
 goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit
 then an impairment exists for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the reporting unit. This difference is not to exceed the goodwill recorded at the reporting unit. Based on the results of the annual assessment
 the Company concluded that as of July 1
 2020
 there were no impairments in its reporting units.




: The Company accounts for revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606
 
 which is more fully described in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 




 Derivative financial instruments used by the Company consist of commodity futures and option contracts
 forward currency contracts and options
On the date a derivative contract is entered into
 the Company designates the derivative as a hedge of variable cash flows to be paid related certain forecasted transactions (&#8220;a cash flow hedge&#8221;)
 as a hedge of the fair value of certain firm commitments (&#8220;a fair value hedge&#8221;)
 or as a non-designated hedging instrument as defined by ASC 815
. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow or fair value hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
 or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. These hedges are accounted for using ASC Topic 815. For all hedging relationships
 the Company documents the hedging relationships and its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transactions
 the hedging instrument
 the hedged item
 the nature of the risk being hedged
 how the hedging instrument&#8217;s effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness. The Company also formally assesses both
 at the hedge&#8217;s inception and on an ongoing basis
 whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or has ceased to be a highly effective hedge
The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows or fair value of the hedged item
 the derivative is de-designated as a hedging instrument because it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur
 or management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued
 the Company continues to carry the derivative on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at its fair value
 and gains and losses that were included in AOCI are recognized in earnings in the same line item affected by the hedged transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings
 or in the month a hedge is determined to be ineffective.




 The Company has a stock incentive plan that provides for share-based employee compensation
 including the granting of stock options
 shares of restricted stock
 restricted stock units
 and performance shares to certain key employees. Compensation expense is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the Company&#8217;s share-based employee compensation plan. The plan is more fully described in Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.




 Basic earnings per common share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) is computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method
 computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of shares outstanding
 including the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and other instruments associated with long-term incentive compensation plans. 




 The Company operates domestically and internationally. In each country
 the business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty. The Company insures its business and assets in each country against insurable risks in a manner that it deems appropriate. Because of this geographic dispersion
 the Company believes that a loss from non-insurable events in any one country would not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s operations as a whole. Additionally
 the Company believes there is no significant concentration of risk with any single customer or supplier whose failure or non-performance would materially affect the Company&#8217;s results. 




ASU No. 2017-04
In January 2017
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2017-04
. This ASU simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill as this ASU eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under this ASU
 an entity will continue to perform its annual
 or interim
 goodwill impairment test to determine if the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount. An entity should then recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value using the results of its Step 1 assessment
 with the loss recognized not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2019
ASU No. 2016-13
In June 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13
 
 which requires the Company to measure and recognize expected credit losses for financial assets held and not accounted for at fair value through net income. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2019
 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 at the beginning of its 2020 fiscal year
ASU No. 2016-02
In February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 
 which supersedes Topic 840
. The Company adopted this updated standard as of January 1
 2019
 using the modified retrospective approach and the effective date as its date of initial application. The Company elected the package of three practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance
 and $161 million of operating lease assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on January 1
ASU No. 2017-12 and ASU 2018-16
In August 2017
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12
. This Update modifies accounting guidance for hedge accounting by making more hedge strategies eligible for hedge accounting
 amending presentation and disclosure requirements
 and changing how companies assess ineffectiveness. The intent is to simplify the application of hedge accounting and increase transparency of information about an entity&#8217;s risk management activities. The amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2018
 with early adoption permitted. &#160;The Company completed its assessment of these updates adopted on January 1
 2019
 including potential changes to existing hedging arrangements
