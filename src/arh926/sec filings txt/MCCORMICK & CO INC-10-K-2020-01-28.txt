 Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries or
 as the context may require
 McCormick&#160;&amp; Company
McCormick is a global leader in flavor. The company manufactures
 markets and distributes spices
 seasoning mixes
 condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry&#8211;retailers
 food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. We also are partners in a number of joint ventures that are involved in the manufacture and sale of flavorful products
 the most significant of which is McCormick de Mexico. Our major sales
 distribution and production facilities are located in North America
 Europe and China. Additional facilities are based in Australia
 India
 Central America
 Thailand and South Africa. McCormick&#160;&amp; Company
In August 2017
 we completed the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's Food Division (RB Foods) from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. The purchase price was approximately $4.21 billion
 net of acquired cash of $24.3 million. The acquired market-leading brands of RB Foods include French&#8217;s
 Frank&#8217;s RedHot
 which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio. We believe that these additions move us to a leading position in the attractive U.S. Condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and flavor solutions segments. At the time of the acquisition
We operate in two business segments
 consumer and flavor solutions. Demand for flavor is growing globally
 and across both segments we have the customer base and product breadth to participate in all types of eating occasions. Our products deliver flavor when cooking at home
 dining out
 purchasing a quick service meal or enjoying a snack. We offer our customers and consumers a range of products to meet the increasing demand for certain product attributes such as organic
 reduced sodium
Consistent with market conditions in each segment
 our consumer segment has a higher overall profit margin than our flavor solutions segment. In 2019
 the consumer segment contributed approximately 61% of sales and 69% of operating income
From locations around the world
 our brands reach consumers in approximately 150 countries and territories. Our leading brands in the Americas include McCormick
 French&#8217;s
 Frank&#8217;s RedHot
 Lawry&#8217;s
 as well as brands such as Gourmet Garden
 Stubb's
. In the Europe
 Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region
 our major brands include the Ducros
 Schwartz
 brands of spices
 brand dessert items. In China
 brands. In Australia
 we market our spices and seasonings under the McCormick brand
 brand
 and packaged chilled herbs under the Gourmet Garden brand. In India
 brand. Elsewhere in the Asia/Pacific region
Our customers span a variety of retailers that include grocery
 mass merchandise
 warehouse clubs
 discount and drug stores
 and e-commerce retailers served directly and indirectly through distributors or wholesalers. In addition to marketing our branded products to these customers
 we are also a leading supplier of private label items
Approximately half of our consumer segment sales are spices
 herbs and seasonings. For these products
 we are a category leader in our primary markets. There are numerous competitive brands of spices
 herbs and seasonings in the U.S. and additional brands in international markets. Some are owned by large food manufacturers
 while others are supplied by small privately-owned companies. In this competitive environment
 we are leading with innovation and brand marketing
In our flavor solutions segment
 we provide a wide range of products to multinational food manufacturers and foodservice customers. The foodservice customers are supplied with branded
 packaged products both directly and indirectly through distributors. We supply food manufacturers and foodservice customers with customized flavor solutions
 and many of these customer relationships have been active for decades. Our range of flavor solutions remains one of the broadest in the industry and includes seasoning blends
 spices and herbs
 condiments
 coating systems and compound flavors. In addition to a broad range of flavor solutions
 our long-standing customer relationships are evidence of our effectiveness in building customer intimacy. Our customers benefit from our expertise in many areas
 including sensory testing
 culinary research
Our flavor solutions segment has a number of competitors. Some tend to specialize in a particular range of products and have a limited geographic reach. Other competitors include larger publicly held flavor companies that are more global in nature
dairy products
 vanilla
 pepper
 capsicums (red peppers and paprika)
 garlic
 onion
. Pepper and other spices and herbs are generally sourced from countries other than the United States. Other raw materials
 like dairy products and onion
 are primarily sourced locally
 either within the United States or from our international locations. Because the raw materials are agricultural products
 they are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather
 growing and harvesting conditions
 market conditions
We respond to this volatility in a number of ways
 including strategic raw material purchases
 purchases of raw material for future delivery
Our products are sold directly to customers and also through brokers
 wholesalers and distributors. In the consumer segment
 products are then sold to consumers under a number of brands through a variety of retail channels
 including grocery
 mass merchandise
 warehouse clubs
 discount and drug stores
 and e-commerce. In the flavor solutions segment
We have a large number of customers for our products. Sales to one of our consumer segment customers

 would not have a material adverse effect on our business. The &#8220;Mc &#8211; McCormick&#8221; trademark is extensively used by us in connection with the sale of our food products in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. markets. The terms of the trademark registrations are as prescribed by law
We also own various patents
Due to seasonal factors inherent in our business
 our sales
 income and cash from operations generally are lower in the first two quarters of the fiscal year
 increase in the third quarter and are significantly higher in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season. This seasonality reflects customer and consumer buying patterns
In order to meet increased demand for our consumer products during our fourth quarter
 we usually build our inventories during the third quarter of the fiscal year. We generally finance working capital items (inventory and receivables) through short-term borrowings
 which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper. For a description of our liquidity and capital resources
Each segment operates in markets around the world that are highly competitive. In this competitive environment
 our growth strategies include customer intimacy and product innovation based on consumer insights. Additionally
 in the consumer segment
We are subject to numerous laws and regulations around the world that apply to our global businesses. In the United States
 the safety
 production
 transportation
 distribution
 advertising
 labeling and sale of many of our products and their ingredients are subject to the Federal Food
 Drug
 and Cosmetic Act; the Food Safety Modernization Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; state consumer protection laws; competition laws
 anti-corruption laws
 customs and trade laws; federal
 state and local workplace health and safety laws; various federal
 state and local environmental protection laws; and various other federal
 state and local statutes and regulations. Outside the United States
 our business is subject to numerous similar statutes
The cost of compliance with federal
 state and local provisions related to protection of the environment has had no material effect on our business. There were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in fiscal year 2019
We had approximately 12
400 full-time employees worldwide as of November 30
. Our operations have not been affected significantly by work stoppages and
 in the opinion of management
 employee relations are good. We have approximately 300 employees covered by a collective bargaining contract in the United States. At our foreign subsidiaries

We are subject in varying degrees to certain risks typically associated with a global business
 such as local economic and market conditions
 exchange rate fluctuations
 and restrictions on investments
 royalties and dividends. In fiscal year 2019
we manage some of these risks

The following are certain risk factors that could affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. Before you buy our Common Stock or Common Stock Non-Voting
 you should know that making such an investment involves risks
 including the risks described below. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or are currently deemed to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business
 financial condition
 or results of operations in the future. If any of the risks actually occur
 our business
 financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected. In that case
 the trading price of our securities could decline
Damage to our reputation or brand name
 loss of brand relevance
 increase in use of private label or other competitive brands by customers or consumers
 or product quality or safety concerns could negatively impact our business
We have many iconic brands with long-standing consumer recognition.  Our success depends on our ability to maintain our brand image for our existing products
 extend our brands to new platforms
We continually make efforts to maintain and improve relationships with our customers and consumers and to increase awareness and relevance of our brands through effective marketing and other measures. From time to time
 our customers evaluate their mix of product offerings
 and consumers have the option to purchase private label or other competitive products instead of our branded products. If a significant portion of our branded business was switched to private label or competitive products
Our reputation for manufacturing high-quality products is widely recognized. In order to safeguard that reputation
 we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our products.  A serious breach of our quality assurance or quality control procedures
 deterioration of our quality image
 impairment of our customer or consumer relationships or failure to adequately protect the relevance of our brands may lead to litigation
 customers purchasing from our competitors or consumers purchasing other brands or private label items that may or may not be manufactured by us
 any of which could have a material negative impact on our business
The food industry generally is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination
 product tampering
 product recall
 import alerts and consumer product liability claims. For instance
 we may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled
 contaminated or damaged
 and certain of our raw materials could be blocked from entering the country if they were subject to government-imposed actions.&#160;We also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products could cause injury or illness
 or that any of our products are mislabeled or fail to meet applicable legal requirements (even if the allegation is untrue). A product recall
 import alert or an adverse result in any such litigation
 or negative perceptions regarding food products and ingredients
 could result in our having to pay fines or damages
 incur additional costs or cause customers and consumers in our principal markets to lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products or ingredients
 any of which could  have a negative effect on our business or financial results and
 depending upon the significance of the affected product
 that negative effect could be material to our business or financial results. Negative publicity about these concerns
 whether or not valid
 may discourage customers and consumers from buying our products or cause disruptions in production or distribution of our products and adversely affect our business
The rising popularity of social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination (whether or not accurate)
 and
 as a result
 negative
 inaccurate
Customer consolidation
 and competitive
 economic and other pressures facing our customers
A number of our customers
 such as supermarkets
 warehouse clubs and food distributors
 have consolidated in recent years and consolidation could continue. Such consolidation could present a challenge to margin growth and profitability in that it has produced large
 sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories; resisting price increases; demanding lower pricing
 increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products; and shifting shelf space currently used for our products to private label and other competitive products. The economic and competitive landscape for our customers is constantly changing
 such as the emergence of new sales channels like e-commerce
 and our customers' responses to those changes could impact our business. Our flavor solutions segment may be impacted if the reputation or perception of the customers of our flavor solutions segment declines. These factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business
We have a number of major customers
 including two large customers that
 in the aggregate
Our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather
 growing and harvesting conditions
 market conditions
dairy products
 vanilla
 pepper
 capsicums (red peppers and paprika)
 garlic
 onion
. While future price movements of raw material costs are uncertain
 we seek to mitigate the market price risk in a number of ways
 including strategic raw material purchases
 purchases of raw material for future delivery
 customer price adjustments and cost savings from our CCI program. We generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk. To the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose
 it has not been material to our business. Any actions we take in response to market price fluctuations may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in raw material prices. Therefore
 we cannot provide assurance that future raw material price fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business
In addition
 we may have very little opportunity to mitigate the risk of availability of certain raw materials due to the effect of weather on crop yield
 government actions
 political unrest in producing countries
 action or inaction by suppliers in response to laws and regulations
 changes in agricultural programs and other factors beyond our control. Therefore
 we cannot provide assurance that future raw material availability will not have a negative impact on our business
Political
 socio-economic and cultural conditions
 as well as disruptions caused by terrorist activities or otherwise
 could also create additional risks for regulatory compliance. Although we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our imported products
 we cannot provide assurance that such events will not have a negative impact on our business
The food industry is intensely competitive. Competition in our product categories is based on price
 product innovation
 product quality
 brand recognition and loyalty
 effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity
 and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. From time to time
 we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures
Food products are extensively regulated in most of the countries in which we sell our products. We are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the growing
 sourcing
 manufacturing
 storage
 labeling
 marketing
 advertising and distribution of food products
 as well as laws and regulations relating to financial reporting requirements
 the environment
 consumer protection
 competition
 anti-corruption
 privacy
and retailers
 foreign supplier verification
 customs and trade laws
 including the import and export of products and product ingredients
 employment
 and health and safety. Enforcement of existing laws and regulations
 changes in legal requirements
 and/or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations
 financial or otherwise
 that could adversely affect our business
 financial condition or operating results.  Increased regulatory scrutiny of
 and increased litigation involving
 product claims and concerns regarding the attributes of food products and ingredients may increase compliance costs and create other obligations that could adversely affect our business
 financial condition or operating results. Governments may also impose requirements and restrictions that impact our business
 such as labeling disclosures pertaining to ingredients. For example
 Proposition 65, the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, in California exposes all food companies to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products in that state. If we were required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in locations where our products are sold in order to comply with Proposition 65
 the sales of those products and other products of our company could suffer
In addition
 there are various compliance obligations for companies that process personal data of certain individuals
 including such obligations required by the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;)
 which came into effect in May 2018
 and the California Consumer Privacy Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;)
 which came into effect in January 2020. These types of data privacy laws create a range of new compliance obligations for companies that process personal data of certain individuals
 and increases financial penalties for non-compliance. For example
 the CCPA imposes requirements on companies that do business in California and collect personal information from customers
 including notice
 consent and service provider requirements. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for companies that fail to comply with these requirements
 as well as a private right of action for data breaches. Regulations to implement portions of the CCPA have not been finalized and could significantly impact CCPA compliance measures. As a company that is subject to data privacy laws
 we bear the costs of compliance with them
 including the GDPR and CCPA
 and are subject to the potential for fines and penalties in the event of a&#160;breach of these laws
 which continue to evolve. These factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business
Our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters
We could have an interruption in our business
 loss of inventory or data
 or be rendered unable to accept and fulfill customer orders as a result of a natural disaster
 catastrophic event
 epidemic or computer system failure. Natural disasters could include an earthquake
 fire
 flood
 tornado or severe storm. A catastrophic event could include a terrorist attack. An epidemic could affect our operations
 major facilities or employees&#8217; and consumers&#8217; health. In addition
 some of our inventory and production facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to harsh weather; a major storm
We cannot provide assurance that our disaster recovery plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue
 and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing. In the event that a natural disaster
 terrorist attack or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of our facilities or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time
 or if harsh weather or health conditions prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner
 our business
We may not be able to successfully consummate and manage ongoing acquisition
From time to time
 we may acquire other businesses and
 based on an evaluation of our business portfolio
 divest existing businesses. These acquisitions
 joint ventures and divestitures may present financial
 managerial and operational challenges
 including diversion of management attention from existing businesses
 difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems
 increased expenses and raw material costs
 assumption of unknown liabilities and indemnities
 and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers. In addition
 we may be required to incur asset impairment charges (including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets) in connection with acquired businesses which may reduce our profitability. If we are unable to consummate such transactions
 or successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings
 our financial results could be adversely affected. Additionally
 joint ventures inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations
 thereby potentially increasing the financial
 legal
 operational
As of&#160;November&#160;30
 2019
 we had approximately&#160;$4.5 billion of goodwill&#160;and approximately $2.6 billion of other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit
 including goodwill
 to the unit's fair value. Similarly
 we test indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values. If the carrying values of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their fair value
 the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered impaired and reduced to their implied fair value or fair value
 respectively. Factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates
 operating margins
 weighted average cost of capital
Because indefinite-lived intangible assets are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition of the related business
 indefinite-lived intangible assets associated with recent business acquisitions
 particularly those acquired in recent low interest rate environments
 such as RB Foods
We operate our business and market our products internationally. In fiscal year 2019
 approximately 40% of our sales were generated in foreign countries. Our foreign operations are subject to additional risks
 including fluctuations in currency values
 foreign currency exchange controls
 discriminatory fiscal policies
 compliance with U.S. and foreign laws
 enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and other economic or political uncertainties. Several countries within the European Union continue to experience sovereign debt and credit issues which causes more volatility in the economic environment throughout the European Union and the United Kingdom (U.K.) Additionally
 international sales
 together with finished goods and raw materials imported into the U.S.
 are subject to risks related to fundamental changes to tax laws as well as the imposition of tariffs
 quotas
 trade barriers and other similar restrictions. All of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues
Primary exposures include the U.S. dollar versus the Euro
 British pound sterling
 Canadian dollar
 Polish zloty
 Australian dollar
 Mexican peso
 Chinese renminbi
 Indian rupee and Thai baht
 as well as the Euro versus the British pound sterling
 We routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to facilitate managing certain of these foreign currency risks. However
 these contracts may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to a decline in operating results due to foreign currency exchange changes. Therefore
 we cannot provide assurance that future exchange rate fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business
The U.K. is currently negotiating the terms of its exit from the European Union (&#8220;Brexit&#8221;). In November 2018
 the U.K. and the European Union agreed upon a draft Withdrawal Agreement that sets out the terms of the U.K.&#8217;s departure
 including commitments on citizen rights after Brexit
 a financial settlement from the U.K.
 and a transition period to allow time for a future trade deal to be agreed.&#160; After the U.K. Parliament failed to approve the Withdrawal Agreement in October 2019
 European Union leaders granted the U.K. a three-month flexible Brexit extension
 avoiding a no-deal exit on the previous deadline of October 31
 2019. On January 23
 2020
 the Withdrawal Act
 after clearing all stages in the U.K. Parliament
 received royal assent from the Queen. Assuming approval by the European Parliament
 the U.K. is expected to officially leave the European Union on January 31
 2020. Following its departure
 the U.K. will enter a transition period until December 31
Agreement allows the U.K./European Union Joint Committee to extend the transition period by up to two years
If the U.K. leaves the European Union with no agreement (&#8220;hard Brexit&#8221;)
 it will likely have an adverse impact on labor and trade in addition to creating further short-term uncertainty and currency volatility.&#160; In the absence of a future trade deal
 the U.K.&#8217;s trade with the European Union and the rest of the world would be subject to tariffs and duties set by the World Trade Organization. Current volatility and tariffs and duties on trade may also occur under any trade agreement negotiated between the U.K. and the European Union
 depending on the agreement's terms. Additionally
 under a hard Brexit or a negotiated trade agreement
 the movement of goods between the U.K. and the remaining member states of the European Union may be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks
 leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure.&#160; These changes to the trading relationship between the U.K and European Union would likely result in increased cost of goods imported into and exported from the U.K. and may decrease the profitability of our U.K. and other operations. Additional currency volatility could drive a weaker British pound
 which increases the cost of goods imported into our U.K. operations and may decrease the profitability of our U.K. operations.&#160;&#160; A weaker British pound versus the U.S. dollar also causes local currency results of our U.K. operations to be translated into fewer U.S. dollars during a reporting period. &#160;With a range of outcomes still possible
 the impact from Brexit remains uncertain and will depend
 in part
 on the final outcome of tariff
 trade
On November 30
 2019
 we had total outstanding variable rate debt of approximately 
 of short-term borrowings
 at a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 2.6%. The interest rates under our term loans and revolving credit facilities can vary based on our credit ratings. Our policy is to manage our interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements. We also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing cost and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk
 including interest rate exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations. We do not enter into contracts for trading purposes
 nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments. Our use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines. However
 our use of these instruments may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in interest rates. Therefore
 we cannot provide assurance that future credit rating or interest rate changes will not have a material negative impact on our business
Our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and
 accordingly
Our credit ratings reflect each rating organization's opinion of our financial strength
 operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations. Our credit ratings were downgraded following our financing of the acquisition of RB Foods in August 2017
 and any reduction in our credit ratings may limit our ability to borrow at interest rates consistent with the interest rates that were available to us prior to that acquisition and the related financing transactions. If our credit ratings are further downgraded or put on watch for a potential downgrade
 we may not be able to sell additional debt securities or borrow money in the amounts
After financing our acquisition of RB Foods
 we have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding. As of November 30
 2019
 the indebtedness of McCormick and its subsidiaries is approximately $4.3&#160;billion. This substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business
 including
increasing our debt service obligations
subjecting us to financial and other restrictive covenants
increasing our vulnerability to
 and reducing our flexibility to respond to
limiting our flexibility in planning for
 or reacting to
placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors
We rely on our revolving credit facilities
 or borrowings backed by these facilities
 to fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate purposes. If any of the banks in the syndicates backing these facilities were unable to perform on its commitments
 our liquidity could be impacted
 which could adversely affect funding of seasonal working capital requirements. We engage in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our revolving credit facilities. During these communications
 none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments. In addition
 we periodically review our banking and financing relationships
 considering the stability of the institutions
 pricing we receive on services and other aspects of the relationships. Based on these communications and our monitoring activities
In addition
 global capital markets have experienced volatility in the past that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding
 and such volatility and tightened access could reoccur in the future. In the event that we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing
 there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time period. Our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time period could have an adverse impact on our operations
LIBOR
 the interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate on our variable rate debt
 including our revolving credit facility
 interest rate swaps
 and cross currency interest rate swaps is expected to be phased out after 2021
 when private-sector banks are no longer required to report the information used to set the rate. Without this data
 LIBOR may no longer be published
 or the lack of quality and quantity of data may cause the rate to no longer be representative of the market. At this time
 no consensus exists as to what rate or rates will become accepted alternatives to LIBOR
 although the U.S. Federal Reserve
 in connection with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee
 a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions
 is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;). SOFR is a more generic measure than LIBOR and considers the cost of borrowing cash overnight
 collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. Given the inherent differences between LIBOR and SOFR or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established
 there are many uncertainties regarding a transition from LIBOR
 including but not limited to the need to amend all contracts with LIBOR as the referenced rate and how this will impact the Company&#8217;s cost of variable rate debt and certain derivative financial instruments. The Company will also need to consider new contracts and if they should reference an alternative benchmark rate or include suggested fallback language
We hold investments in equity and debt securities in our qualified defined benefit pension plans and in a rabbi trust for our U.S. non-qualified pension plan. Deterioration in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn or otherwise
 or an increase in the actuarial valuation of the plans' liability due to a low interest rate environment
 could cause (or increase) an underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans
 thereby increasing our obligation to make contributions to the plans. An obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses
 and may have an adverse impact on our operations
Consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers
 some of which are highly leveraged. In addition
 competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels through our customer base. These factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk. Current credit markets are volatile
Our information technology systems are critically important to operating our business.  We rely on our information technology systems
 some of which are or may be managed or hosted by or out-sourced to third party service providers
 to manage our business data
 communications
 supply chain
 order entry and fulfillment
 and other business processes.  If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build
 sustain
 and protect appropriate information technology systems and infrastructure
 or we do not effectively implement system upgrades or oversee third party service providers
 our business or financial results could be negatively impacted.  The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction or reporting errors
 processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers
Furthermore
 our information technology systems are subject to cyber-attacks or other security incidents
 service disruptions
 or other system or process failures.  Such incidents could result in unauthorized access to information including customer
 consumer or other company confidential data as well as disruptions to operations.  We have experienced in the past
 and expect to continue to experience
 cybersecurity threats and incidents
 although to date none has been material.  To address the risks to our information technology systems and data
 we maintain an information security program that includes updating technology
 developing security policies and procedures
 implementing and assessing the effectiveness of controls
 conducting risk assessments of third party service providers and designing business processes to mitigate the risk of such breaches.  There can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident.  Moreover
 the development and maintenance of these measures requires continuous monitoring as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures evolve.  If we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve an incident
 it may have a material
 negative impact on our operations or business reputation
 and we may experience other adverse consequences such as loss of assets
 remediation costs
 litigation
 regulatory investigations
 and the failure by us to retain or attract customers following such an event.  Additionally
 we rely on services provided by third-party vendors for certain information technology processes and functions
If we are not able to successfully implement our business transformation initiative or utilize information technology systems and networks effectively
We continue to implement our multi-year business transformation initiative to execute significant change to our global processes
 capabilities and operating model
 including in our Global Enablement (GE) organization
 in order to provide a scalable platform for future growth
 while reducing costs. As technology provides the backbone for greater process alignment
 information sharing and scalability
 we are also making investments in our information systems
 including the multi-year program to replace our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system currently underway
 which includes the transformation of our financial processing systems to enterprise-wide systems solutions. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing business transformation initiative
 and we plan to implement these systems throughout all parts of our businesses. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure
 or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative
 it may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently and remain in step with the changing needs of our business
 which could result in the loss of customers and revenue. In addition
 failure to either deliver the applications on time
 or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs
 could lead to business disruption and loss of customers and revenue. In connection with these implementations and resulting business process changes
 we continue to enhance the design and documentation of business processes and controls
 including our internal control over financial reporting processes
We utilize cloud-based services and systems and networks managed by third-party vendors to process
 transmit and store information and to conduct certain of our business activities and transactions with employees
 customers
 vendors and other third parties. Our utilization of these cloud-based services and systems will increase as we implement our business transformation initiatives. If any of these third-party service providers or vendors do not perform effectively
 or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance (including compliance with service-level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements)
 we may not be able to achieve expected cost savings
 we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers
 our reputation could be harmed or we could be subject to litigation
 claims
 legal or regulatory proceedings
 inquiries or investigations. Depending on the function involved
 such errors may also lead to business disruption
 processing inefficiencies
 the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise
 incorrect or adverse effects on financial reporting
 litigation or remediation costs
 or damage to our reputation
negative impact on employee morale. In addition
The global nature of our business
As a global business
 our tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors
legislation
 our global mix of earnings
 the tax characteristics of our income
impairments
 acquisitions and dispositions
 adjustments to our reserves related to uncertain tax positions
In addition
 significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish accruals for certain tax contingencies when
 despite the belief that our tax return positions are appropriately supported
 the positions are uncertain. The tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances
 such as the progress of tax audits
 case law and emerging legislation. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals and changes to those accruals
 including related interest and penalties
 as considered appropriate by management. When particular matters arise
Climate change may negatively affect our business
Unseasonable or unusual weather or long-term climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of spices
 herbs and other raw materials. There is concern that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures
 weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity or practices
 we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products. In addition
 such climate change may result in modifications to the eating preferences of the ultimate consumers of certain of our products
Our intellectual property rights
 and those of our customers
 could be infringed
 challenged or impaired
We possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business
 and we are provided access by certain customers to particular intellectual property rights belonging to such customers.  These intellectual property rights include ingredient formulas
 trademarks
 copyrights
 patents
 business processes and other trade secrets which are important to our business and relate to some of our products
 our packaging
 the processes for their production
 and the design and operation of equipment used in our businesses. We protect our intellectual property rights
 and those of certain customers
 globally through a variety of means
 including trademarks
 copyrights
 patents and trade secrets
 third-party assignments and nondisclosure agreements
 and monitoring of third-party misuses of intellectual property. If we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property (and the intellectual property of customers to which we have been given access)
 the value of our products and brands could be reduced and there could be an adverse impact on our business
Litigation
We are party to a variety of legal claims and proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Since litigation is inherently uncertain
 there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings
 or that management&#8217;s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters
 including any reserves taken in connection with such matters
 will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such claims or proceedings. In the event that management&#8217;s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of current claims and proceedings proves inaccurate
 or litigation that is material arises in the future
Streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs
 simplify or improve processes
We regularly evaluate whether to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs
 simplify or improve processes
 and improve our competitiveness
 and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future. From time to time
 those changes are of such significance that we may transfer production from one manufacturing facility to another; transfer certain selling and administrative functions from one location to another; eliminate certain manufacturing
If we are unable to fully realize the benefits from our CCI program
Our future success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry. Any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies under our CCI program
 an ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization
 or other similar programs
 could have an adverse effect on our business

The following Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&amp;A) is intended to help the reader understand McCormick&#160;&amp; Company
 Incorporated
 our operations and our present business environment. MD&amp;A is provided as a supplement to
 and should be read in conjunction with
 our financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item&#160;8 of this report. We use certain non-GAAP information that we believe is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends. The dollar and share information in the charts and tables in the MD&amp;A are in millions
McCormick is a global leader in flavor. The company manufactures
 markets and distributes spices
 seasoning mixes
 condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry&#8211;retailers
 food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. We manage our business in two operating segments
 consumer and flavor solutions
Our long-term annual growth objectives in constant currency are to increase sales 4% to 6%
:  Over time
 we expect to grow sales with similar contributions from: 1) our base business&#8211;driven by brand marketing support
 customer intimacy
&#8211;We expect to drive sales growth by optimizing our brand marketing investment through improved speed
 quality and effectiveness. We measure the return on our brand marketing investment and have identified digital marketing as one of our highest return investments in brand marketing support. Through digital marketing
 we are connecting with consumers in a personalized way to deliver recipes
&#8211;For our consumer segment
 we believe that scalable and differentiated innovation continues to be one of the best ways to distinguish our brands from our competition
 including private label. We are introducing products for every type of cooking occasion
 from gourmet
For flavor solutions customers
 we are developing seasonings for snacks and other food products
 as well as flavors for new menu items. We have a solid pipeline of flavor solutions aligned with our customers&#8217; new product launch plans
 many of which include &#8220;better-for-you&#8221; innovation. With over 20 product innovation centers around the world
&#8211;Acquisitions are expected to approximate one-third of our sales growth over time. Since the beginning of 2015
 we have completed seven acquisitions
 which are driving sales in both our consumer and flavor solutions segments. We focus on acquisition opportunities that meet the growing demand for flavor and health. Geographically
 our focus is on acquisitions that build scale where we currently have presence in both developed and emerging markets. Our acquisitions have included bolt-on opportunities and the August 17
 2017 acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's Food Division (RB Foods) from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. for approximately $4.2 billion
 net of acquired cash. The acquired market-leading brands of RB Foods include French&#8217;s&#174;
 Frank&#8217;s RedHot&#174; and Cattlemen&#8217;s&#174;
: We are fueling our investment in growth with cost savings from our CCI program
 an ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization
 that also includes savings from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 of the accompanying financial statements. In addition to funding brand marketing support
 product innovation and other growth initiatives
We are making investments to build the McCormick of the future
 including in our Global Enablement (GE) organization to transform McCormick through globally aligned
 innovative services to enable growth. As more fully described in note 3 of notes to our consolidated financial statements
 we expect to incur special charges of approximately $60 million to $65 million associated with our GE initiative of which approximately $38 million have been recognized through November 30
 2019.  As technology provides the backbone for this greater process alignment
 information sharing and scalability
 we are also making investments in our information systems. In 2019
 we have progressed in implementing our global enterprise resource planning (ERP) replacement program which will enable us to accelerate the transformation of our ways of working and provide a scalable platform for growth. We expect that
 in total over the course of the ERP replacement program from late 2018 through 2022
 we will invest from approximately $300 million to $350 million
 including expenses related to the go-live activities in our operations
 to enable the anticipated completion of the global roll out of our new information technology platform in 2022. Of that projected
 $300 million to $350 million
 we expect capitalized software to account for approximately 40% and program expenses to account for approximately 60%. Of the approximately $180 million to $210 million of operating expenses included in our projected total spending related to our ERP replacement program
 approximately $20 million have been recognized through November 30
The GE initiative is expected to generate annual savings
 ranging from approximately $45 million to $55 million
 once all actions are implemented
: We continue to generate strong cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities reached $946.8 million in 2019
 an increase of $125.6 million from the $821.2 million realized in 2018. In 2019
 we continued to have a balanced use of cash for debt repayment
 capital expenditures and the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are using our cash to fund shareholder dividends
 with annual increases in each of the past 34 years
 and to fund capital expenditures
 acquisitions and share repurchases.  In 2019
On a long-term basis
In 2019
We grew volume and product mix
Net sales growth was negatively impacted by fluctuations in currency rates that reduced sales growth by 1.9%. Excluding this impact
Operating income was $957.7 million in 2019 and $891.1 million in 2018. We recorded $20.8 million and $16.3 million of special charges in 2019 and 2018
 respectively
 related to organization and streamlining actions. In 2018
 we also recorded $22.5 million of transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisition of RB Foods that reduced operating income. In 2019
 compared to the year-ago period
 the favorable impact of higher sales
 $118.9 million of cost savings from our CCI program
 including organization and streamlining actions
 and the impact of the previously mentioned 2018 integration costs more than offset increased conversion costs
 higher stock-based compensation expense
 and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.  Excluding special charges together with
 for 2018
 transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisition of RB Foods
 adjusted operating income was $978.5 million in 2019
 an increase of 5.2%
 compared to $929.9 million in the year-ago period. In constant currency
 adjusted operating income rose 6.7%. For further details and a reconciliation of non-GAAP to reported amounts
Diluted earnings per share was $5.24 in 2019 and $7.00 in 2018. The year-on-year decrease in earnings per share was driven mainly by the significant reduction in the non-recurring benefit of the U.S. Tax Act and
 to a much smaller extent
 by a higher amount of shares outstanding and by increased special charges in 2019 as compared to 2018. Those unfavorable impacts in 2019 were partially offset by higher operating income as previously described
 by the absence of transaction and integration expenses
 by lower interest expense and by higher income from unconsolidated operations in 2019 as compared to 2018. Special charges lowered earnings per share by $0.12 and $0.10 in 2019 and 2018
 respectively.  Transaction and integration expenses lowered earnings per share by $0.13 in 2018.  A non-recurring benefit from the U.S. Tax Act increased diluted earnings per share by $0.01 and $2.26 in 2019 and 2018
 respectively. Excluding the effects of special charges
 transaction and integration expenses
 and the non-recurring benefit of the U.S. Tax Act
 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $5.35 in 2019 and $4.97 in 2018
We are well-positioned for another year of underlying solid performance in 2020. In 2020
 we expect to grow net sales 2% to 4% over 2019&#8217;s net sales of $5
347.4 million. That anticipated 2020 sales growth is primarily driven by new products
 brand marketing
 expanded distribution and the impact of pricing actions
 which
 in conjunction with cost savings
 are expected to offset an anticipated mid-single digit cost increase. That increase consists entirely of organic growth as we do not currently anticipate an incremental sales impact from acquisitions in 2020. We expect our 2020 gross profit margin to be 25 to 75 basis points higher in 2020 than in 2019
In 2020
 we expect operating income
 compared to 2019&#8217;s operating income of $957.7 million
 to range from comparable to an increase of 2%; that range includes an estimated 600 basis point unfavorable impact from expenses related to the investment in our global ERP replacement. Our expectations for 2020 operating income reflect the impact of lower special charges
 estimated at $8 million in 2020 compared to $20.8 million in 2019. Excluding special charges (but including the estimated 600 basis point unfavorable impact from expenses related to our global ERP investment)
 we expect 2020&#8217;s adjusted operating income
 compared to 2019&#8217;s adjusted operating income of $978.5 million
 to range from a decline of 1% to an increase of 1%. Our CCI-led cost savings target in 2020 is approximately $105 million. In 2020
Our underlying effective tax rate is projected to be higher in 2020 than in 2019.  Absent the projected impact of discrete tax items
 we estimate our underlying tax rate to be approximately 24% in 2020. Including the projected impact of estimated discrete tax items
 including the favorable impact of a discrete item that occurred in December 2019
 we estimate that our consolidated effective tax rate will approximate 22% in fiscal 2020.  Excluding the non-recurring benefit of $1.5 million associated with the U.S. Tax Act and taxes associated with special charges recognized in fiscal 2019
Diluted earnings per share was $5.24 in 2019. Diluted earnings per share for 2020 are projected to range from $5.15 to $5.25. Excluding the per share impact of the non-recurring benefit from the U.S. Tax Act of $0.01 and special charges of $0.12 in 2019
 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $5.35 in 2019. Adjusted diluted earnings per share (excluding an estimated $0.05 per share impact from special charges) are projected to be $5.20 to $5.30 in 2020. Our projected adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2020
 which ranges from a decline of 3% to a decline of 1% from adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.35 in 2019
In 2020
 we expect minimal impact of foreign currency
 as compared to 2019 levels
 on our projections of net sales

Selling
 general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expense was $1
166.8 million in 2019 compared to $1
163.4 million in 2018
 an increase of $3.4 million. That increase in SG&amp;A expense was driven by increased stock-based compensation expense and higher distribution costs
 partially offset by CCI-led cost savings. SG&amp;A expense in 2019 also reflected the impact of two significant
 but largely offsetting items: (i) expenses associated with our investment in a global ERP platform in support of our GE business transformation initiative that increased SG&amp;A expense over the prior year level; and (ii) a one-time fiscal 2019 expense reduction from the alignment of an employee benefit plan to our global standard that decreased SG&amp;A expense from the prior year level. As a result of the above factors over an increased net sales base
 SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of net sales was 21.8%
We regularly evaluate whether to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs
 simplify or improve processes
 and improve our competitiveness
 and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future. From time to time
During 2019
 we recorded $20.8 million of special charges
 consisting primarily of (i) $14.1 million of costs related to our multi-year GE business transformation initiative
 including $10.6 million of third-party expenses
&#160;$2.1 million related to severance and related benefits
During 2018
 we recorded $16.3 million of special charges
 consisting primarily of: (i) $11.5 million related to our multi-year GE business transformation initiative
 consisting of $7.5 million of third party expenses
 $1.0 million of employee severance charges and a non-cash asset impairment charge of $3.0 million (which non-cash asset impairment charge was related to the write-off of certain software assets that are incompatible with our move to the new global ERP platform); (ii) a one-time payment
 in the aggregate amount of $2.2 million
Transaction and integration expenses related to the RB Foods acquisition totaled $22.5 million for 2018. These costs primarily consisted of outside advisory
 service and consulting costs; employee-related costs
Operating income increased by $66.6 million
 or 7.5%
 from $891.1 million in 2018 to $957.7 million in 2019. An absence of transaction and integration expenses in 2019
 compared to $22.5 million related to our acquisition of RB Foods in 2018
 more than offset a $4.5 million increase in special charges in 2019 from $16.3 million in 2018 to $20.8 million in 2019. Operating income as a percent of net sales rose by 110 basis points in 2019
 from 16.8% in 2018 to 17.9% in 2019 as a result of the factors previously described. Our operating income as a percent of net sales in 2019 was impacted by two large
 but substantially offsetting items:  (i) expenses associated with our investment in a global ERP platform in support of our GE business transformation initiative that decreased operating income as a percent of sales by approximately 35 basis points in 2019; and (ii) a one-time fiscal 2019 expense reduction from the alignment of an employee benefit plan to our global standard that increased operating income as a percent of sales by approximately 40 basis points in 2019. Excluding the effect of special charges and transaction and integration expenses previously described
 adjusted operating income was $978.5 million in 2019 as compared to $929.9 million in 2018
 an increase of $48.6 million or 5.2% over the 2018 level. Adjusted operating income as a percent of sales rose by 80 basis points in 2019
Other income
Interest expense was $9.4 million lower for 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily due to a decline in average total borrowings. Other income
 net for 2019 increased by $1.9 million from the 2018 level due principally to higher non-service cost income associated with our pension and postretirement benefit plans and higher interest income
The provision for income taxes is based on the then-current estimate of the annual effective tax rate adjusted to reflect the tax impact of items discrete to the fiscal period. We record tax expense or tax benefits that do not relate to ordinary income in the current fiscal year discretely in the period in which such items occur pursuant to the requirements of U.S. GAAP. Examples of such types of discrete items not related to ordinary income of the current fiscal year include
 but are not limited to
 excess tax benefits associated with share-based payments to employees
 changes in estimates of the outcome of tax matters related to prior years (including reversals of reserves upon the lapsing of statutes of limitations)
 provision-to-return adjustments
 and the settlement of tax audits and
 beginning in 2019
As more fully described in note 12 of the accompanying financial statements
 the U.S. Tax Act was enacted in December 2017. The U.S. Tax Act significantly changed U.S. corporate income tax laws by
 among other things
 reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% beginning on January 1
 2018 and creating a territorial tax system with a one-time transition tax on previously deferred post-1986 foreign earnings of U.S. subsidiaries. Under GAAP (specifically
 ASC Topic 740
)
balances are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. We recorded a net benefit of $301.5 million associated with the U.S. Tax Act during 2018. This amount includes a $380.0 million benefit from the revaluation of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities as of January 1
 2018
 based on the new lower corporate income tax rate offset
 in part
 by an estimated net transition tax impact of $78.5 million. That net transition tax impact is comprised of the mandated one-time transition tax on previously deferred post-1986 foreign earnings of U.S. subsidiaries estimated at $75.3 million
 together with additional foreign withholding taxes of $7.9 million associated with previously unremitted prior year earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were no longer considered indefinitely reinvested as of the effective date of the U.S. Tax Act and that were subsequently repatriated in 2018
 less a $4.7 million reduction in our fiscal 2018 income taxes directly resulting from the transition tax. In addition
 in 2019
The effective tax rate was an expense of 19.2% in 2019 as compared to a benefit of 21.2% in 2018. The effective tax rate benefit of 21.2% in 2018 includes the non-recurring net tax benefit of $301.5 million associated with the U.S. Tax Act
 as more fully described above
 that had a (40.7)% impact on 2018&#8217;s effective tax rate. Net discrete tax benefits were $43.7 million in 2019
 which is an increase of $15.6 million from $28.1 million in 2018
 excluding the non-recurring benefit of the U.S. Tax Act in 2018. For 2019
 the effective tax rate was impacted by $15.2 million of tax benefits associated with an intra-entity asset transfer that occurred during 2019 under the provisions of ASU No. 2016-16
 which we adopted on December 1
 2018. Discrete tax benefits in both periods include excess tax benefits associated with share-based payments to employees ($22.4 million and $21.7 million in 2019 and 2018
 respectively)
 reversal of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits for the expiration of the statues of limitations and settlements with taxing authorities in several jurisdictions
 the previously described non-recurring benefit of the U.S. Tax Act
Income from unconsolidated operations
 which is presented net of the elimination of earnings attributable to non-controlling interests
 increased $6.1 million in 2019 from the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to the impact of higher earnings from our largest joint venture
 McCormick de Mexico
 as well as the impact of eliminating a lower level of earnings associated with our minority interests in 2019 as compared to 2018. We own 50% of most of our unconsolidated joint ventures
We reported diluted earnings per share of $5.24 in 2019
We measure the performance of our business segments based on operating income
of operating income
 excluding special charges as well as transaction and integration expenses related to our RB Foods acquisition
 to consolidated operating income. In the following discussion
In 2019
 the Company transferred management responsibility for certain export operations in both its consumer and flavor solutions segments between geographies within each respective segment
 shifting from the Americas to the Asia/Pacific regions within each segment

Sales of our consumer segment in 2019 grew by 0.7% as compared to 2018 and grew by 2.5% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 2.4% to sales
In the Americas
 consumer sales rose 2.4% in 2019 as compared to 2018 and rose by 2.7% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 2.7% to sales
In the EMEA region
 consumer sales decreased 5.5% in 2019 as compared to 2018 and decreased 0.2% on a constant currency basis. Volume and product mix increased sales by 1.0%
In the Asia/Pacific region
 consumer sales increased 0.8% as compared to 2018 and increased 5.7% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 2.9% to sales
 led by strong sales in India and Southeast Asia. Pricing actions
 primarily in China
We grew segment operating income for our consumer segment by $39.2 million
 or 6.1%
 in 2019 compared to 2018. The favorable impact of higher sales and CCI-led cost savings more than offset increased conversion costs. On a constant currency basis
 segment operating income for our consumer segment rose 7.3%. Segment operating income margin for our consumer segment rose by 110 basis points to 20.7% in 2019 from 19.6% in 2018

In the Americas
 flavor solutions sales rose 2.2% in 2019 as compared to 2018 and rose 2.6% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 2.4% to sales and included growth in new products as well as in base business
In the EMEA region
In the Asia/Pacific region
 flavor solutions sales decreased 3.4% in 2019 as compared to 2018 and increased 0.6% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 0.9% to sales and included increased sales to quick service restaurants
We grew segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment by $9.4 million
 or 3.2%
 in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in segment operating income was driven by higher sales as well as lower SG&amp;A costs. On a constant currency basis

Sales for 2018 increased by 12.1% from 2017 and by 10.9% on a constant currency basis. Both the consumer and flavor solutions segments drove higher volume and product mix that added 2.2% to sales in 2019. This was driven by new products as well as growth in the base business. The incremental impact of pricing actions added 0.5% to sales in 2018

In 2018
 our gross profit margin rose 160 basis points to 39.5% from 37.9% in 2017. While this expansion in 2018 includes the accretive impact from our acquisition of the RB Foods business
 together with the absence of related transaction and integration expenses of $20.9 million that depressed our 2017 gross profit margin by 50 basis points
 our core business was also a driver of that expansion. In 2018
 CCI-led cost savings and the shift in our core product portfolio to more value-added products continued to drive profit expansion across both of our segments
 which was partially offset by an increase in freight costs during 2018 as compared to 2017. Excluding the effect of those transaction and integration expenses in 2017

 general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expense was $1
163.4 million in 2018 compared to $1
031.2 million in 2017
 an increase of $132.2 million. That increase in SG&amp;A expense was driven by the incremental impact of the RB Foods acquisition
 together with increased brand marketing and higher distribution costs
 which was offset in part by CCI-led cost savings
 including the benefits from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 of the accompanying financial statements. As a result
 SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of net sales was 22.0%
During 2018
 we recorded $16.3 million of special charges
 consisting primarily of: (i) $11.5 million related to our multi-year GE business transformation initiative
 consisting of $7.5 million of third party expenses
 $1.0 million of employee severance charges and a non-cash asset impairment charge of $3.0 million (that non-cash asset impairment charge was related to the write-off of certain software assets that are incompatible with our move to the new global ERP platform); (ii) a one-time payment
 in the aggregate amount of $2.2 million
During 2017
 we recorded $22.2 million of special charges
 consisting primarily of $12.7 million related to third party expenses incurred as part of our evaluation of changes relating to our GE transformation initiative
 $2.8 million related to employee severance benefits and other costs associated with the relocation of one of our Chinese manufacturing facilities
 $2.5 million for severance and other exit costs associated with the closure of our manufacturing plant in Portugal
Transaction and integration expenses related to our RB Foods acquisition totaled&#160;$22.5 million and $77.1 million in 2018 and 2017
 respectively. In 2018
 these costs primarily consisted of outside advisory
 service and consulting costs; employee-related costs; and other costs related to the acquisition. In 2017
 these expenses consisted of amortization of the acquisition-date fair value adjustment of inventories of $20.9 million that was included in cost of goods sold; outside advisory
 service and consulting costs; employee-related costs; and other costs related to the acquisition
Operating income increased by $191.3 million
 or 27.3%
 from $699.8 million in 2017 to $891.1 million in 2018. The change in operating income was impacted by (i) a $39.2 million decrease in transaction and integration expenses
 from $61.7 million in 2017 to $22.5 million in 2018
 related to our acquisition of RB Foods in 2018; and (ii) a $5.9 million decrease in special charges in 2018 as compared to 2017. Operating income as a percent of net sales rose by 200 basis points in 2018
 from 14.8% in 2017 to 16.8% in 2018 as a result of the factors previously described. Excluding the effect of special charges and transaction and integration expenses
 adjusted operating income was $929.9 million in 2018 as compared to $783.7 million in 2017
 an increase of $146.2 million or 18.7% over the 2017 level. Adjusted operating income as a percent of sales rose by 90 basis points in 2018
Other income
Interest expense for 2018 of $174.6 million was sharply higher than the prior year level
 primarily due to higher average borrowings in 2018 related to our incurrence of $3.7 billion in debt in August 2017 to finance the acquisition of RB Foods (see note 6 of the accompanying financial statements). Other income
 net
 for 2018 of $24.8 million was significantly higher than the 2017 level principally due to i) a $9.6 million increase in income related to the non-service component of our pension and other post-retirement plans
 ii) a gain of $6.3 million recognized on the sale in 2018 of a building vacated as part of our move to a new global headquarters in Maryland
 iii) higher interest income
As more fully described above and in note 12 of the accompanying financial statements
 the U.S. Tax Act was enacted in December 2017. We recorded a net benefit of $301.5 million associated with the U.S. Tax Act during 2018. This amount included a $380.0 million benefit from the revaluation of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities as of January 1
 2018
 based on the new lower corporate income tax rate offset
 in part
 by an estimated net transition tax impact of $78.5 million. That net transition tax impact was comprised of the mandated one-time transition tax on previously deferred post-1986 foreign earnings of U.S. subsidiaries estimated at $75.3 million
 together with additional foreign withholding taxes of $7.9 million associated with previously unremitted prior year earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were no longer considered indefinitely reinvested as of the effective date of the U.S. Tax Act and that were subsequently repatriated in 2018
The effective tax rate was a benefit of 21.2% in 2018 as compared to an effective tax rate expense of 25.4% in 2017.  The effective tax rate benefit of 21.2% in 2018 includes the net tax benefit of $301.5 million associated with the U.S. Tax Act
 as more fully described above
 that had a (40.7)% impact on 2018&#8217;s effective tax rate.  Our 2018 effective tax rate also reflects the effects of the lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate under the U.S. Tax Act and higher other net discrete tax benefits. Net discrete tax benefits
 excluding the effects of the U.S. Tax Act in 2018
 increased by $3.9 million from $24.2 million in 2017 to $28.1 million in 2018. Discrete tax benefits in both periods include excess tax benefits associated with share-based payments to employees ($21.7 million and $10.7 million in 2018 and 2017
 respectively)
 reversal of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits for the expiration of the statues of limitations and settlements with taxing authorities in several jurisdictions
 and other discrete items
 including
 in 2017
Income from unconsolidated operations increased $0.9 million in 2018 from the prior year. This increase was mainly attributable to higher earnings from our largest joint venture
 McCormick de Mexico
 partially offset by the impact of a higher elimination of earnings associated with our minority interests in 2018 than in 2017. We own 50% of most of our unconsolidated joint ventures
 including McCormick de Mexico
We reported diluted earnings per share of $7.00 in 2018

Sales of our consumer segment in 2018 grew by 11.9% as compared to 2017 and grew by 10.5% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 1.7% to sales
In the Americas
 consumer sales rose 13.4% in 2018 as compared to 2017 and rose by 13.3% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 0.6% to sales
 pricing actions added 1.0% to sales
In the EMEA region
 consumer sales increased 6.9% in 2018 as compared to 2017 and rose 1.6% on a constant currency basis. Volume and product mix increased sales by 1.8%
 led by growth in France and export sales to developing markets. This growth was partially offset by sales weakness in Poland driven by competitive conditions. The incremental impact of the RB Foods acquisition added 0.8% to sales
In the Asia/Pacific region
 consumer sales increased 11.5% in 2018 as compared to 2017 and increased 9.0% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 6.7% to sales. Growth was led by China through product innovation and increased distribution
 partially offset by lower private label sales in Australia. Pricing actions added 1.2% to sales
We grew segment operating income for our consumer segment by $74.7 million
 or 13.3%
 in 2018 compared to 2017. The favorable impact of greater sales and higher CCI-led cost savings more than offset the unfavorable impact of higher costs and brand marketing expense. On a constant currency basis
 segment operating income for our consumer segment rose 12.4%. Segment operating income margin for our consumer segment rose by 20 basis points to 19.6% in 2018 from 19.4% in 2017. The increase in segment operating income margin was driven by a higher gross profit margin and the leverage of fixed and semi-fixed elements of SG&amp;A over the higher sales base in 2018 as compared to 2017. Those factors were partially offset by an increase in SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales
 driven by increased investment in brand marketing and higher distribution costs. The previously described gross profit margin improvement includes the incremental accretive impact attributable to the RB Foods acquisition as well as expansion in our core business

In the Asia/Pacific region
 flavor solutions sales increased 3.9% in 2018 as compared to 2017 and increased 1.6% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix increased sales by 1.3%
 while pricing actions reduced sales by 0.5% as compared to 2017. Increased sales in China
 led by new products and limited time offers
 were offset in part by sales declines in Australia
We grew segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment by $71.5 million
 or 32.3%
 in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in segment operating income was due to the incremental impact of the RB Foods acquisition
 coupled with CCI-led cost savings. On a constant currency basis
 segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment rose 32.3%.  Segment operating income margin for our flavor solutions segment rose by 210 basis points to 14.2% in 2018 from 12.1% in 2017 and was driven by a higher gross profit margin offset

Special charges &#8211; Special charges consist of expenses associated with certain actions undertaken by the Company to reduce fixed costs
 simplify or improve processes
 and improve our competitiveness and are of such significance in terms of both up-front costs and organizational/structural impact to require advance approval by our Management Committee. Upon presentation of any such proposed action (including details with respect to estimated costs

 expenses associated with the approved action are classified as special charges upon recognition and monitored on an ongoing basis through completion. In 2018
 we also included in special charges
 as approved by our Management Committee
 expense associated with a one-time payment
 made to eligible U.S. hourly employees
 to distribute a portion of the non-recurring net income tax benefit recognized in connection with the enactment of the U.S. Tax Act as that non-recurring income tax benefit is excluded from our computation of adjusted income taxes

Transaction and integration expenses associated with the RB Foods acquisition &#8211; We exclude certain costs associated with our acquisition of RB Foods in August 2017 and its subsequent integration into the Company. Such costs

 include transaction costs associated with the acquisition

Income taxes associated with the U.S. Tax Act &#8211; In connection with the enactment of the U.S. Tax Act in December 2017
 we recorded a net non-recurring income tax benefit of $301.5 million during the year ended November 30
 2018
 which included the estimated impact of the tax benefit from revaluation of net U.S. deferred tax liabilities based on the new lower corporate income tax rate and the tax expense associated with the one-time transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. We recorded an additional net income tax benefit of $1.5 million during the year ended November 30

Because we are a multi-national company
 we are subject to variability of our reported U.S. dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange
 or what we refer to as amounts expressed &#8220;on a constant currency basis
&#8221; is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is
Percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. To present this information for historical periods
 current year results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the prior fiscal year
 rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. As a result
 the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current year and the prior fiscal year. The tables set forth below present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis as follows: (1) to present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income for 2019 on a constant currency basis
 net sales and adjusted operating income for 2019 for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for 2018 and compared to the reported results for 2018; and (2) to present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income for 2018 on a constant currency basis

 2020 projected local currency sales
 adjusted operating income
 and adjusted net income for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at currently prevailing exchange rates and are compared to those 2020 local currency projected results
 translated into U.S. dollars&#160; at the average actual exchange rates in effect during the corresponding months in fiscal year 2019 to determine what the 2020 consolidated U.S. dollar sales
 adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share would have been if the relevant currency exchange rates had not changed from those of the comparable prior-year periods. In 2020
 we expect minimal impact of foreign currency
 as compared to 2019 levels
 on our projections of net sales
In addition to the above non-GAAP financial measures
 we use a leverage ratio which is determined using non-GAAP measures. A leverage ratio is a widely-used measure of ability to repay outstanding debt obligations and is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating financial leverage. We believe that our leverage ratio is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating our financial leverage
 although our method to calculate our leverage ratio may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate such a leverage ratio. We determine our leverage ratio as net debt (which we define as total debt
 net of cash in excess of $75.0 million) to adjusted earnings before interest
 tax
 depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus expenses for interest
 income taxes
 depreciation and amortization
 less interest income and as further adjusted for cash and non-cash acquisition-related expenses (which may include the effect of the fair value adjustment of acquired inventory on cost of goods sold)
 special charges
 stock-based compensation expenses
 and certain gains or losses (which may include third party fees and expenses and integration costs). Adjusted EBITDA and our leverage ratio are both non-GAAP financial measures. Our determination of the leverage ratio is consistent with the terms of our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and our term loans which require us to maintain our leverage ratio below certain levels. Under those agreements
 the applicable leverage ratio is reduced annually. As of November 30
 2019
 our capacity under the revolving credit facility is not affected by these covenants. We do not expect that these covenants would limit our access to our revolving credit facility for the foreseeable future; however

We generate strong cash flow from operations which enables us to fund operating projects and investments that are designed to meet our growth objectives
 service our debt
 increase our dividend
 fund capital projects and other investments
 and make share repurchases when appropriate. Due to the cyclical nature of a portion of our business
In the cash flow statement
 the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates
 as these do not reflect actual cash flows. Accordingly
The reported values of our assets and liabilities held in our non-U.S. subsidiaries and affiliates can be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between periods. At November 30
 2019
 the exchange rates for the Euro
 Australian dollar
 Polish zloty and Chinese renminbi were lower versus the U.S. dollar than at November 30
 2018. At November 30
 2019
 the exchange rates for the British pound sterling and Canadian dollar were higher versus the U.S. dollar than at November 30
 in 2019
 in 2018
 in 2017. The increases in cash flow from operations in both 2019 and 2018 were primarily due to higher net income
 related to the U.S. Tax Act. In addition
 as more fully described below
 our working capital management favorably impacted operating cash flow in 2019
 2018 and 2017. In 2019
 the increases to operating cash flow were partially offset by a use of cash associated with other assets and liabilities
 totaling $81.5 million. In 2018
RB Foods
 as compared to the source of cash in 2017. Dividends received from unconsolidated affiliates
 which were higher in 2019 compared to 2018 and higher in 2018 as compared to 2017
 principally related to inventory
 trade accounts receivable
 impacts our operating cash flow. The change in inventory had a significant impact on the variability in cash flow from operations. It was a use of cash in 2019 and 2018 and a source of cash in 2017. The change in trade accounts receivable has varied in the last three years as well
 as it was a source of cash in 2019 and 2018
In addition to operating cash flow
 we also use cash conversion cycle (CCC) to measure our working capital management. This metric is different than operating cash flow in that it uses average balances instead of specific point in time measures. CCC is a calculation of the number of days
 on average
 that it takes us to convert a cash outlay for resources
 such as raw materials
The decreases in CCC in 2019 from 2018 and in 2018 from 2017 were due
 in both instances
 to an increase in our days payable outstanding as a result of extending our payment terms to suppliers and to a lesser extent
 by a decrease in our days sales outstanding. Our CCC is also impacted by days in inventory which increased in 2019 as compared to 2018

 respectively
During 2017
 we issued approximately 6.35 million shares of our Common Stock Non-Voting to fund our acquisition of RB Foods (see notes 2 and 13 of the accompanying financial statements)
 which included approximately 0.8 million shares from the exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. The net proceeds from this issuance

The leverage ratio covenant in our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and the term loan agreements
 both outstanding at November 30
 2019
 2018
 and 2017
 provide that Adjusted EBITDA under that covenant also include the pro forma impact of acquisitions
 as applicable. As of November 30
 2017
 our leverage ratio under the terms of those agreements

 as of November 30
 2019
 and 5.1 as of November 30
 2018 and 2017
 as of November 30
 as of November 30
 2019 is due to both an increase in our adjusted EBITDA
 which was driven by higher operating income in 2019 as compared to 2018
 as well as our lower level of net debt at November 30
The decrease in the ratio from 5.1 as of November 30
 as of November 30
 2018 is principally due to an increase in our adjusted EBITDA
 which was driven by higher operating income in 2018 as compared to 2017. In addition
 the ratio was favorably impacted by our lower level of net debt at November 30
Most of our cash is in our foreign subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. Prior to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Act on December 22
 2017
 the permanent repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have had adverse tax consequences; however
 those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations
 capital projects and future acquisitions. Currently
 the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could still have adverse tax consequences related to the effects of withholding and other taxes. At November 30
 2019
term debt in the U.S. The average short-term borrowings outstanding for the years ended November&#160;30
 2019 and 2018 were $848.6 million and $700.0 million
 respectively. The total average debt outstanding for the years ended November&#160;30
 2019 and 2018 was $4
753.8 million and $5
081.6 million
 &#8211; Cash flows from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity for funding growth
 share repurchases
 dividends and capital expenditures. We also rely on our revolving credit facility
 or borrowings backed by this facility
In August 2017
 we entered into a five-year $1.0 billion revolving credit facility
 which will expire in August 2022. The current pricing for the credit facility
 on a fully drawn basis
 is LIBOR plus 1.25%. The pricing of the credit facility is based on a credit rating grid that contains a fully drawn maximum pricing of the credit facility equal to LIBOR plus 1.75%. This facility replaced our prior facilities: (i) a five-year $750 million revolving credit facility that was due to expire in June 2020 and (ii) a 364-day $250 million revolving facility
 which we entered into in the second quarter of 2017 and that was due to expire in March 2018. We generally use this facility to support our issuance of commercial paper. If the commercial paper market is not available or viable
 we could borrow directly under our revolving credit facility. The facility is made available by a syndicate of banks
 with various commitments per bank. If any of the banks in this syndicate are unable to perform on their commitments
 our liquidity could be impacted
 which could reduce our ability to grow through funding of seasonal working capital. In addition to our committed revolving credit facility
 as of November 30
 2019
 that can be withdrawn based upon the lenders' discretion. We engage in regular communication with all banks participating in our credit facilities. During these communications
 none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments. In addition
 we periodically review our banking and financing relationships
 considering the stability of the institutions and other aspects of the relationships. Based on these communications and our monitoring activities
&#8211; We hold investments in equity and debt securities in both our qualified defined benefit pension plans and through a rabbi trust for our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan. Cash contributions to pension plans
 including unfunded plans
 in 2019
 $13.5 million in 2018
 and $18.7 million in 2017. It is expected that the 2020 total pension plan contributions will be approximately $12.0 million. Future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets. We base our investment of plan assets
 in part
 on the duration of each plan&#8217;s liabilities. Across all of our qualified defined benefit pension plans
 approximately 59% of assets are invested in equities
 31% in fixed income investments and 10% in other investments. Assets in the rabbi trust are primarily invested in corporate-owned life insurance
 the value of which approximates an investment mix of 60% in equities and 40% in fixed income investments. See note 10 of the accompanying financial statements

 we purchased 100% of the shares of Enrico Giotti SpA (Giotti)
 a leading European flavor manufacturer located in Italy
 for a cash payment of $123.8 million
 net of cash acquired of $1.2 million. The acquisition was funded with cash and short-term borrowings. Giotti is well known in the industry for its innovative beverage
 sweet
 savory and dairy flavor applications. Our acquisition of Giotti in fiscal 2017 expanded the breadth of value-added products for McCormick's flavor solutions segment
On August 17
 2017
 we completed the acquisition of RB Foods. The purchase price was approximately $4.21 billion
 net of acquired cash of $24.3 million
 and included a preliminary working capital adjustment of $11.2 million. In December 2017
 we paid $4.2 million associated with the final working capital adjustment.  The acquisition was funded through our issuance of approximately 6.35 million shares of common stock non-voting (see note 13 of the accompanying financial statements) and through new borrowings comprised of senior unsecured notes and&#160;pre-payable&#160;term loans (see note 6 of the accompanying financial statements). The acquired market-leading brands of RB Foods include French&#8217;s
Frank&#8217;s RedHot and Cattlemen&#8217;s
The following line graph compares the yearly change in McCormick&#8217;s cumulative total shareholder return (stock price appreciation plus reinvestment of dividends) on McCormick&#8217;s Non-Voting Common Stock with (1)&#160;the cumulative total return of the Standard&#160;&amp; Poor&#8217;s 500 Stock Price Index

We utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk
 including foreign exchange and interest rate exposures
 which exist as part of our ongoing business operations. We do not enter into contracts for trading purposes
Primary exposures include the U.S. dollar versus the Euro
 British pound sterling
 Canadian dollar
 Polish zloty
 Australian dollar
 Mexican peso
 Chinese renminbi
 Indian rupee and Thai baht
 as well as the Euro versus the British pound sterling
During 2019
 the foreign currency translation component in other comprehensive income was principally related to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in our subsidiaries with a functional currency of the British pound sterling
 Euro
 Polish zloty
 Chinese yuan
 Australian dollar
 Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. Beginning in the first quarter of 2019
 we also utilized cross currency interest rate swap contracts
 which are designated as net investment hedges
 to manage the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in subsidiaries with a functional currency of the British pound sterling and Euro. Gains and losses on these instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). In 2018 and 2017
The following table summarizes the foreign currency exchange contracts held at November&#160;30
 2019. All contracts are valued in U.S. dollars using year-end 2019 exchange rates and have been designated as hedges of foreign currency transactional exposures
FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AT NOVEMBER 30
We had a number of smaller contracts at November 30
 2019 with an aggregate notional value of $21.8 million to purchase or sell other currencies
 such as the Romanian leu

 and Singapore dollar. The aggregate fair value of these contracts was $0.2 million at November&#160;30
At November 30
 2018
 we had foreign currency exchange contracts for the Euro
 British pound sterling
 Canadian dollar
 Australian dollar
 Polish zloty
 Swiss franc and other currencies
.  The aggregate fair value of these contracts was $(2.0) million at November 30
Beginning in the first quarter of 2019
 we also utilized cross currency interest rate swap contracts that are considered net investment hedges. As of November 30
 2019
 we had notional values of cross currency interest rate swap contracts of (i) $250 million notional value to receive $250 million at three-month U.S. LIBOR plus 0.685% and pay &#163;194.1 million at three-month GBP LIBOR plus 0.740% and (ii) &#163;194.1 million notional value to receive &#163;194.1 million at three-month GBP LIBOR plus 0.740% and pay &#8364;221.8 million at three-month Euro EURIBOR plus 0.808%. These cross-currency interest rate swap contracts expire in August 2027. For more information
 Our policy is to manage interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements. We also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing costs and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt.

. While future movements of raw material costs are uncertain
 we respond to this volatility in a number of ways
 including strategic raw material purchases
 purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments. We generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk. To the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose
&#8211; The customers of our consumer segment are predominantly food retailers and food wholesalers. Consolidations in these industries have created larger customers. In addition
 competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels including mass merchandisers

Pension and postretirement funding can vary significantly each year due to changes in legislation
 our significant assumptions and investment return on plan assets. As a result
We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of November&#160;30
In preparing the financial statements
 we are required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets
 liabilities
 revenue and expenses reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information   disclosed by us
 including information about contingencies
 risk and financial condition. We believe
 given current facts and circumstances
 our estimates and assumptions are reasonable
 adhere to U.S. GAAP and are consistently applied. Inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates
 and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise. In preparing the financial statements
 we make routine estimates and judgments in determining the net realizable value of accounts receivable
 inventory
In several of our major geographic markets
 the consumer segment sells our products by entering into annual or multi-year customer arrangements. Known or expected pricing or revenue adjustments
 such as trade discounts
 rebates or returns
 are estimated at the time of sale. Where applicable
 future reimbursements are estimated based on a combination of historical patterns and future expectations regarding these programs.  Key sales terms
 such as pricing and quantities ordered
 are established on a frequent basis such that most customer arrangements and related incentives have a one-year or shorter duration. Estimates that affect revenue
 such as trade incentives and product returns
Our reporting units are the same as our operating segments. We estimate the fair value of a reporting unit by using a discounted cash flow model. Our discounted cash flow model calculates fair value by present valuing future expected cash flows of our reporting units using our internal cost of capital as the discount rate. We then compare this fair value to the carrying amount of the reporting unit
 including intangible assets and goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value
 then we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill. An impairment charge would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value.  As of November&#160;30

amounts of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. In the event that the fair value of any of the brand names or trademarks are less than their related carrying amounts
The estimation of fair values of our brand names and trademarks requires us to make significant assumptions
 including expectations with respect to sales and profits of the respective brands and trademarks
 related royalty rates and appropriate discount rates
 which are based

As of November 30
 2019
 we had $2
643.0 million of brand name assets and trademarks recorded in our balance sheet
 and none of the balances exceeded their estimated fair values at that date. Of the $2

320.0 million relates to the French&#8217;s
 Frank&#8217;s RedHot and Cattlemen&#8217;s brand names and trademarks
 recognized as part of our acquisition of RB Foods in August 2017
 that we group for purposes of our impairment analysis; and (ii) the remaining $323.0 million represents a number of other brand name assets and trademarks with individual carrying values ranging from $0.2 million to $106.4 million. The percentage excess of estimated fair value over respective book values for each of our brand names and trademarks
 including the $2
320.0 million related to our French&#8217;s
 Frank's RedHot and Cattlemen&#8217;s brands
 was 20% or more as of November 30

The brand names and trademarks related to recent acquisitions may be more susceptible to future impairment as their carrying values represent recently determined fair values. A change in assumptions with respect to recently acquired businesses
 including those affected by rising interest rates or a deterioration in expectations of future sales
 profitability or royalty rates as well as future economic and market conditions
 or higher income tax rates
We estimate income taxes and file tax returns in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to file a tax return. At the end of each year
 an estimate for income taxes is recorded in the financial statements. Tax returns are generally filed in the third or fourth quarter of the subsequent year. A reconciliation of the estimate to the final tax return is done at that time which will result in changes to the original estimate. We believe that our tax return positions are appropriately supported
 but tax authorities may challenge certain positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the GAAP guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. We believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions
 including related interest
 is adequate. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and
 therefore
 could have a material impact on our tax provision
 net income and cash flows. We have recorded valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In doing so
 we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Both future taxable income and tax planning strategies include a number of estimates. In addition
 interpretative guidance continues to be issued in connection with the U.S. Tax Act enacted in December 2017. While we have considered available guidance
Pension and other postretirement plans&#8217; costs require the use of assumptions for discount rates
 investment returns
 projected salary increases
 mortality rates and health care cost trend rates. The actuarial assumptions used in our pension and postretirement benefit reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension and postretirement benefit obligations. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate
We will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the assumptions used in the measurement of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. In addition
We are also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We maintain a system of internal control that is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the fair and reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements
Our control environment is the foundation for our system of internal control over financial reporting and is embodied in our Business Ethics Policy. It sets the tone of our organization and includes factors such as integrity and ethical values. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by formal policies and procedures which are reviewed
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
 which is composed solely of independent directors
 meets periodically with members of management
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). This assessment included review of the documentation of controls
 evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls
 testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this assessment. Although there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting
 based on our assessment
 we have concluded with reasonable assurance that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of November&#160;30

 and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at item 15(2) and our report dated January 28
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
 assessing the risk that a material weakness exists
 testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk
A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)&#160;pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&#160;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)&#160;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging

At November 30
 2019
 the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of brand names and trademarks with an aggregate carrying value of approximately $2.6 billion.  As explained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements
 these assets are assessed for impairment at least annually primarily using the relief-from-royalty methodology to determine their fair values. If the fair value of any of the brand names or trademarks is less than its carrying amount
Auditing the Company's impairment assessments is complex due to the significant estimation required in determining the fair value of the brand names and trademarks. Significant management judgment is also involved in determining whether individual brand names and trademarks should be grouped for purposes of the fair value determination or must be evaluated individually. The Company's methodologies for estimating the fair value of these assets involve significant assumptions and inputs
 including projected financial information for net sales and operating profit by brand
 royalty rates
 and discount rates
 all of which are sensitive to and affected by economic
 industry
We obtained an understanding
 evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's controls over the Company&#8217;s indefinite-lived intangible asset review process
 including controls over management&#8217;s review of its asset groupings and the significant assumptions described above.  We tested controls over the review of methodologies used
 significant assumptions and inputs
To test the estimated fair value of the Company&#8217;s indefinite-lived intangible assets
 we performed audit procedures that included
 among others
 evaluating the asset groupings used by the Company to perform its impairment assessment
 assessing the methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analyses. We compared the significant assumptions to current industry
 market and economic trends
 to the Company's historical results
 to other guideline companies within the same industry
 and to other relevant data. In addition

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows
 risk-adjusted discount rates
 assumed royalty rates
Our reporting units used to assess potential goodwill impairment are the same as our business segments. We calculate fair value of a reporting unit by using a discounted cash flow model and then compare that to the carrying amount of the reporting unit
 including intangible assets and goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the calculated fair value
Our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of brand names and trademarks. We primarily determine fair value by using a relief-from-royalty method and then compare that to the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value
Fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists. If an impairment is determined to exist

We account for product shipping and handling as fulfillment activities with costs for these activities recorded within cost of goods sold.  Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as accounts receivable on the balance sheet and require payment on a short-term basis.

(the &#8220;Revenue Recognition ASU&#8221;)
(the &#8220;Pension ASU&#8221;)
In May 2014
 the FASB issued the Revenue Recognition ASU
 which supersedes previously existing revenue recognition guidance. Under this new guidance
new revenue recognition guidance allows companies to account for shipping and handling activities that occur before and after the customer has obtained control of a product as fulfillment activities rather than as a promised service; and we applied this accounting policy election. In addition
 the new revenue guidance requires that customer payments be accounted for as a reduction in the transaction price unless the payment to a customer is in exchange for a distinct good or service. The adoption of this standard did not have and is not expected to have an effect on the timing of our revenue recognition. There was no effect on operating income
 net income
In March 2017
 the FASB issued the Pension ASU.&#160;This guidance revises how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans present the net periodic benefit cost in their income statement and requires that the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost be presented in the same income statement line items as other employee compensation costs from services rendered during the period. Of the components of net periodic benefit cost
 only the service cost component is eligible for asset capitalization. The other components of the net periodic benefit cost must be presented separately from the line items that include the service cost and outside of any subtotal of operating income on the income statement. The new standard was adopted as of December 1
 2018 and has been applied on a retrospective basis. Adoption of the new standard solely impacted classification within our consolidated income statement

.&#160;This guidance eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires
 for qualifying hedges
 the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. The guidance also modifies the accounting for components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness
 eases documentation and assessment requirements and modifies certain disclosure requirements. The new standard is effective for the first quarter of our fiscal year ending November 30
 2020
 with early adoption permitted in any interim period or fiscal year before the effective date. We have elected to adopt this guidance effective December 1
In October 2016
 The ASU eliminates the deferral of the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers other than inventory. As a result
 the tax expense from the intercompany sale of assets

associated changes to deferred taxes will be recognized when the sale occurs even though the pre-tax effects of the transaction have not been recognized. This new standard was effective beginning in fiscal year 2019 and was required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the first day of fiscal year 2019.

(ASC 840) for both lessees and lessors. Our leases principally relate to: (i) certain real estate
 including that related to a number of administrative
 distribution and manufacturing locations; (ii) certain machinery and equipment
 including forklifts; and (iii) certain automobiles
 delivery and other vehicles
 including an airplane. The new guidance in ASU No. 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all leases (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease). The lease liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments and the right-of-use asset will be based on the lease liability
 subject to adjustment such as for initial direct costs. For income statement purposes
 the new standard retains a dual model similar to ASC 840
 requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. For lessees
 operating leases will result in straight-line expense (similar to current accounting by lessees for operating leases under ASC 840) while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern (similar to current accounting by lessees for capital leases under ASC 840). In July 2018
We will adopt the standard using a modified retrospective approach as of December 1
 2019
 the first day of our fiscal year 2020. We will elect the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance
 which among other things
 allows us to retain the historical lease classification.&#160; In addition
 we will elect to combine the lease and non-lease components for all asset categories other than real estate. We will also make an accounting policy election to exclude from balance sheet reporting those leases with initial terms of 12 months or less (short-term leases).

This guidance eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead
 a company will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. The new standard will be effective for the first quarter of our fiscal year ending November 30

In our consolidated income statement
 we include a separate line item captioned &#8220;special charges&#8221; in arriving at our consolidated operating income. Special charges consist of expenses
 including related impairment charges
 associated with certain actions undertaken to reduce fixed costs
 simplify or improve processes
 and improve our competitiveness and are of such significance in terms of both up-front costs and organizational/structural impact to require advance approval by our Management Committee
 comprised of our senior management
 including our Chairman
 President and Chief Executive Officer. Upon presentation of any such proposed action (generally including details with respect to estimated costs
 which typically consist principally of employee severance and related benefits
 together with ancillary costs associated with the action that may include a non-cash component
 such as an asset impairment
 or a component which relates to inventory adjustments that are included in cost of goods sold; impacted employees or operations; expected timing; and expected savings) to the Management Committee and the Committee&#8217;s advance approval
 expenses associated with the approved action are classified as special charges upon recognition and monitored on an on-going basis through completion. Certain ancillary expenses related to these actions approved by our Management Committee do not qualify for accrual upon approval but are included as special charges as incurred during the course of the actions. In 2018
 we also included in special charges

We are potentially exposed to concentrations of credit risk with trade accounts receivable and financial instruments. The customers of our consumer segment are predominantly food retailers and food wholesalers. Consolidations in these industries have created larger customers. In addition
 competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels including mass merchandisers
 dollar stores
 warehouse clubs
 discount chains and e-commerce. This has caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk. We generally have a large and diverse customer base which limits our concentration of credit risk. At November 30

In December 2017
 President Trump signed into law Pub. L. 115-97
 &#8220;An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018&#8221; (this legislation is referred to herein as the &#8220;U.S. Tax Act&#8221;). The U.S. Tax Act provides for significant changes in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended. Certain provisions of the U.S. Tax Act were effective during our fiscal year ended November 30
 2018 with all provisions of the U.S. Tax Act effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year beginning December 1
 2018.  The U.S. Tax Act contains provisions with separate effective dates but is generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31
 2017. The U.S. Tax Act creates a new requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries
 known as Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI)
 must be included in the gross income of the subsidiary&#8217;s U.S. shareholder.  This provision of the U.S. Tax Act was effective for us for our fiscal year beginning December 1
Beginning on January 1
 2018
&#160;and is reflected as a reduction in our income tax expense in our results for the year ended November 30
 2018. The U.S. Tax Act imposes a one-time transition tax on post-1986 earnings of non-U.S. affiliates that have not been repatriated for purposes of U.S. federal income tax
 for earnings reflected by cash and cash equivalent items and 8% for other assets. This transition tax
 based on our fiscal 2018 tax return filed in fiscal 2019
 in fiscal 2018). The cash tax effects of the transition tax
 of current and carried forward excess foreign tax credits
 as well as other items of&#160;
 resulted in a net tax liability of 
 which&#160;can be remitted in installments over an eight-year period as we are doing. As of November 30

 we incurred additional foreign withholding taxes

Historically
 we have not provided deferred income taxes on the cumulative undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries. During fiscal 2018
 previously undistributed earnings of certain international subsidiaries were no longer considered indefinitely reinvested as of January 1
 2018; therefore
 of income tax expense in fiscal 2018. Our intent is to continue to reinvest the remaining undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries indefinitely. Therefore
 in 2019 there were no incremental previously undistributed earnings that no longer met the requirements of indefinite reinvestment. While federal income tax expense has been recognized as a result of the U.S. Tax Act
 we have not provided any additional deferred taxes with respect to items such as foreign withholding taxes

Tax settlements or statute of limitation expirations could result in a change to our uncertain tax positions.  We believe that the reasonably possible total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of November 30
 2019 that could decrease in the next 12 months as a result of various statute expirations
We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The open years subject to tax audits vary depending on the tax jurisdictions. In the U.S federal jurisdiction
 we are no longer subject to income tax audits by taxing authorities for years before 2016. In other major jurisdictions
We are under normal recurring tax audits in the U.S. and in several jurisdictions outside the U.S. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position

During 2017
 shares of our common stock non-voting in connection with our acquisition of RB Foods (see note 2)

 after the underwriting discount and related expenses
During the normal course of our business
November 30
 2019
 no material reserves were recorded. The determination of probability and the estimation of the actual amount of any such loss are inherently unpredictable
 and it is therefore possible that the eventual outcome of such claims and litigation could exceed the estimated reserves
 if any. However
We operate in two business segments: consumer and flavor solutions. The consumer and flavor solutions segments manufacture
 market and distribute spices
 seasoning mixes
 condiments and other flavorful products throughout the world. Our consumer segment sells to retail channels
 including grocery
 mass merchandise
 warehouse clubs
 discount and drug stores
 and e-commerce under the &#8220;McCormick&#8221; brand and a variety of brands around the world
 including &#8220;French's
&#8221; &#8220;Frank's RedHot
&#8221; &#8220;Lawry&#8217;s
&#8221; &#8220;Zatarain&#8217;s

&#8221; &#8220;Kamis
&#8221; &#8220;Kohinoor
In each of our segments
 we produce and sell many individual products which are similar in composition and nature. With their primary attribute being flavor
Historically
 we have measured segment performance based on operating income excluding special charges as this activity is managed separately from the business segments. Beginning in 2017
 we also excluded transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisition of RB Foods from our measure of segment performance as these expenses are similarly managed separately from the business segments. These transaction and integration expenses excluded from our segment performance measure include the amortization of the acquisition-date fair value adjustment of inventories that is included in cost of goods sold
 costs directly associated with that acquisition and costs associated with integrating the RB Foods business. Although the segments are managed separately due to their distinct distribution channels and marketing strategies
 manufacturing and warehousing are often integrated to maximize cost efficiencies. We do not segregate jointly utilized assets by individual segment for purposes of internal reporting
 performance evaluation
In 2019
 the Company transferred management responsibility for certain export operations in both its consumer and flavor solutions segments between geographies within each respective segment
Asia/Pacific regions within each segment
We have a large number of customers for our products. Sales to one of our consumer segment customers
 Wal-Mart Stores
 Inc.
 accounted for approximately 
. Sales to one of our flavor solutions segment customers
 PepsiCo
 Inc.
Accounting policies for measuring segment operating income and assets are consistent with those described in note 1. Because of integrated manufacturing for certain products within the segments
 products are not sold from one segment to another but rather inventory is transferred at cost. Inter-segment sales are not material. Corporate assets include cash
 deferred taxes

In December 2017
 President Trump signed into law Pub. L. 115-97
 &#8220;An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018&#8221; (this legislation is referred to herein as the &#8220;U.S. Tax Act&#8221;). The U.S. Tax Act provides for significant changes in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended. Certain provisions of the U.S. Tax Act were effective during our fiscal year ended November 30
 2018 with all provisions of the U.S. Tax Act effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year beginning December 1
 2018.  The U.S. Tax Act contains provisions with separate effective dates but is generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31
 2017. The U.S. Tax Act creates a new requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries
 known as Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI)
 must be included in the gross income of the subsidiary&#8217;s U.S. shareholder.  This provision of the U.S. Tax Act was effective for us for our fiscal year beginning December 1
Beginning on January 1
 2018
&#160;and is reflected as a reduction in our income tax expense in our results for the year ended November 30
 2018. The U.S. Tax Act imposes a one-time transition tax on post-1986 earnings of non-U.S. affiliates that have not been repatriated for purposes of U.S. federal income tax
 for earnings reflected by cash and cash equivalent items and 8% for other assets. This transition tax
 based on our fiscal 2018 tax return filed in fiscal 2019
 in fiscal 2018). The cash tax effects of the transition tax
 of current and carried forward excess foreign tax credits
 as well as other items of&#160;
 resulted in a net tax liability of 
 which&#160;can be remitted in installments over an eight-year period as we are doing. As of November 30
 2019
 recognized in 2018
 we incurred additional foreign withholding taxes
 net of a U.S. foreign tax credit
 reduction in our fiscal 2018 income taxes as a consequence of the transition tax
 both of which we recognized as a component of our income tax expense for the year ended November 30
 2018
In 2019
State income taxes
Other

At November 30
 2019
 net decrease in the valuation allowance from November 30
 2018 to November 30
 2019 mainly relates to subsidiaries' net operating losses
Historically
 we have not provided deferred income taxes on the cumulative undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries. During fiscal 2018
 previously undistributed earnings of certain international subsidiaries were no longer considered indefinitely reinvested as of January 1
 2018; therefore
 of income tax expense in fiscal 2018. Our intent is to continue to reinvest the remaining undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries indefinitely. Therefore
 in 2019 there were no incremental previously undistributed earnings that no longer met the requirements of indefinite reinvestment. While federal income tax expense has been recognized as a result of the U.S. Tax Act
 we have not provided any additional deferred taxes with respect to items such as foreign withholding taxes
As of November 30
 2019
 if recognized
 all of the 
 in 2019
 2018 and 2017

 we had accrued 
 respectively
Tax settlements or statute of limitation expirations could result in a change to our uncertain tax positions.  We believe that the reasonably possible total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of November 30
 2019 that could decrease in the next 12 months as a result of various statute expirations
We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The open years subject to tax audits vary depending on the tax jurisdictions. In the U.S federal jurisdiction
 we are no longer subject to income tax audits by taxing authorities for years before 2016. In other major jurisdictions
We are under normal recurring tax audits in the U.S. and in several jurisdictions outside the U.S. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position
 we believe that our reserves for uncertain tax positions are adequate to cover existing risks and exposures.

        documentation: The estimated measure of the minimum percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.

All previous accounting standards (such as FASB Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, FASB Interpretations, FASB Staff Positions, Emerging Issues Task Force Consensuses, other pronouncements of the FASB or other designated bodies, or other forms of GAAP are considered accounting pronouncements) were superseded upon the adoption of the Codification.

The estimated measure of the maximum percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.

We use derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk
 including foreign currency and interest rate exposures
 which exist as part of our ongoing business operations. We do not enter into contracts for trading purposes
 nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument and all derivatives are designated as hedges. We are not a party to master netting arrangements
We are potentially exposed to foreign currency fluctuations affecting net investments in subsidiaries
At November 30
 2019
 at November 30
Contracts which are designated as hedges of anticipated purchases denominated in a foreign currency (generally purchases of raw materials in U.S. dollars by operating units outside the U.S.) are considered cash flow hedges. The gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in cost of goods sold
 at which time the net amount deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income is also recognized in cost of goods sold. Gains and losses from contracts that are designated as hedges of assets
 liabilities or firm commitments are recognized through income

We are potentially exposed to concentrations of credit risk with trade accounts receivable and financial instruments. The customers of our consumer segment are predominantly food retailers and food wholesalers. Consolidations in these industries have created larger customers. In addition
 competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels including mass merchandisers
 dollar stores
 warehouse clubs
 discount chains and e-commerce. This has caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk. We generally have a large and diverse customer base which limits our concentration of credit risk. At November 30

In our consolidated income statement
 we include a separate line item captioned &#8220;special charges&#8221; in arriving at our consolidated operating income. Special charges consist of expenses
 including related impairment charges
 associated with certain actions undertaken to reduce fixed costs
 simplify or improve processes
 and improve our competitiveness and are of such significance in terms of both up-front costs and organizational/structural impact to require advance approval by our Management Committee
 comprised of our senior management
 including our Chairman
 President and Chief Executive Officer. Upon presentation of any such proposed action (generally including details with respect to estimated costs
 which typically consist principally of employee severance and related benefits
 together with ancillary costs associated with the action that may include a non-cash component
 such as an asset impairment
 or a component which relates to inventory adjustments that are included in cost of goods sold; impacted employees or operations; expected timing; and expected savings) to the Management Committee and the Committee&#8217;s advance approval
 expenses associated with the approved action are classified as special charges upon recognition and monitored on an on-going basis through completion. Certain ancillary expenses related to these actions approved by our Management Committee do not qualify for accrual upon approval but are included as special charges as incurred during the course of the actions. In 2018
 we also included in special charges
 as approved by our Management Committee
 expense associated with a one-time payment
 made to eligible U.S. hourly employees
 to distribute a portion of the non-recurring net income tax benefit recognized in connection with the enactment of the U.S. Tax Act and as more fully described in note 12.
We continue to evaluate changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs
 simplify or improve processes
During 2019
&#160;of special charges
 related to our GE initiative
 of third-party expenses
&#160;related to severance and related benefits
&#160;related to other costs
 in special charges recorded during 2019
 were paid in cash
During 2018
 of special charges
 related to our global enablement initiative
 as more fully described below; (ii) a one-time payment
 in special charges recognized in 2018 related to our GE initiative
 related to third party expenses
 represented a non-cash asset impairment charge
 related to employee severance benefits. That non-cash asset impairment charge was related to the write-off of certain software assets that are incompatible with our future move
 approved in 2018
 in special charges recorded during 2018
 represented a non-cash asset impairment
 with the remaining accrual paid in 2019. As of November 30
 2019
During 2017
 of special charges
 related to third party expenses incurred associated with our evaluation of changes relating to our global enablement initiative
 for severance and other exit costs associated with our Europe
 Middle East
During 2017
 our Management Committee approved a multi-year initiative during which we expect to execute significant changes to our global processes
by aligning and simplifying processes throughout McCormick
 in part building upon our current shared services foundation and expanding the end-to-end processes presently under that foundation. We expect this initiative
 which we refer to as Global Enablement (GE)
 to enable this scalable platform for future growth while reducing costs
 enabling faster decision making
While we are continuing to fully develop the details of our GE operating model
 we expect the cost of the GE initiative&#8212;to be recognized as &#8220;Special charges&#8221; in our consolidated income statement over its multi-year course&#8212;to range from approximately 
 we estimate that approximately sixty percent will be attributable to cash payments associated with related costs of GE implementation and transition
 including outside consulting and other costs and approximately forty percent will be attributable to employee severance and related benefit payments both directly related to the initiative. We incurred 
 of special charges associated with our GE initiative during 2019
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.

During the normal course of our business

 no material reserves were recorded. The determination of probability and the estimation of the actual amount of any such loss are inherently unpredictable
 and it is therefore possible that the eventual outcome of such claims and litigation could exceed the estimated reserves
 if any. However
 we believe that the likelihood that any such excess might have a material adverse effect on our financial statements is remote.

Retirement Benefits
 Description [Abstract]





We sponsor defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. and certain foreign locations. In addition
 we sponsor defined contribution plans in the U.S. We contribute to defined contribution plans in locations outside the U.S.
During fiscal years 2018 and 2017
On December 1
 2017
 our Management Committee approved the freezing of benefits under our pension plans in Canada. The effective date of this freeze was November 30
 2019. Although those plans have been frozen
 employees who are participants in the plans retained benefits accumulated up to the date of the freeze
 based on credited service and eligible earnings
On December 1
 2016
 our Management Committee approved the freezing of benefits under the McCormick U.K. Pension and Life Assurance Scheme (the U.K. plan). The effective date of this freeze was December 31
 2016. Although the U.K. plan has been frozen
retained benefits accumulated up to the date of the freeze
 based on credited service and eligible earnings
On January 3
 2017
 our Management Committee approved the freezing of benefits under the McCormick Pension Plan
 the defined benefit pension plan available to U.S. employees hired on or prior to December 31
 2011. The effective date of this freeze was November 30
 2018. Employees who are participants in that plan retained benefits accumulated up to the date of the freeze
 based on credited service and eligible earnings
On January 3
 2017
 the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved the freezing of benefits under the McCormick Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the &#8220;SERP&#8221;). The effective date of this freeze was January 31
 2017. Executives who are participants in the SERP as of the date of the freeze
 including certain named executive officers
 retained benefits accumulated up to that date
 based on credited service and eligible earnings
As a result of these changes
 we remeasured pension assets and benefit obligations as of the dates of the approvals indicated above and (i) in fiscal year 2018
; and (ii) in fiscal year 2017
 we reduced the U.S. and U.K. plan benefit obligations by 
 respectively. These remeasurements resulted in non-cash
 for fiscal years 2018 and 2017
 respectively. These net actuarial gains consist principally of curtailment gains of 
 which are included in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 2018 and 2017
 respectively
 as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss) on the line entitled Unrealized components of pension plans. Deferred taxes associated with these actuarial gains

As part of our acquisition of RB Foods in August 2017
 we assumed a defined benefit pension plan that covers eligible union employees of the Reckitt Benckiser food business (the RB Foods Union Pension Plan). The related plan assets and benefit obligation of the RB Foods Union Pension Plan are included in the U.S. in the preceding table. At the acquisition date
 the funded status of that plan was 
 based upon a preliminary valuation. During 2018
 we finalized the purchase accounting valuation for this plan which improved the funded status of this plan by 
 at the date of acquisition. During 2019 and 2018
 we made contributions of

The investment objectives of the defined benefit pension plans are to provide assets to meet the current and future obligations of the plans at a reasonable cost to us. The goal is to optimize the long-term return across the portfolio of investments at a moderate level of risk. Higher-returning assets include mutual
 co-mingled and other funds comprised of equity securities
 utilizing both active and passive investment styles. These more volatile assets are balanced with less volatile assets
 primarily mutual
 co-mingled and other funds comprised of fixed income securities. Professional investment firms are engaged to provide advice on the selection and monitoring of investment funds

 of the participant's salary for all U.S. employees who are employed on December 31 of each year. Prior to December 1
 2018
 for the U.S. defined contribution retirement plan
 we matched&#160;100%&#160;of a participant&#8217;s contribution up to the first&#160;3%&#160;of the participant&#8217;s salary
 and&#160;50%&#160;of the next&#160;2%&#160;of the participant&#8217;s salary. In addition
 we made contributions of&#160;3%&#160;of the participant's salary for U.S. employees not covered by the defined benefit plan. Some of our smaller U.S. subsidiaries sponsor separate 401(k) retirement plans. We also sponsor a non-qualified defined contribution retirement plan. Our contributions charged to expense under all U.S. defined contribution retirement plans were

During 2017
On August 23
 2017
 our Management Committee approved changes to our postretirement medical benefits plan for eligible U.S. employees and retirees (employees hired after December 31
 2008 are not eligible for the subsidy).&#160;These changes included consolidating benefits providers and simplifying and reducing our subsidy for postretirement medical benefits. The effective date of the change in our subsidy was January 1
On August 23
 2017
 our Management Committee approved the elimination of life insurance benefits under our other postretirement benefit plan to eligible U.S. active employees (that life insurance benefit was available to U.S. employees hired on or prior to December 31
 2008). The effective date of this plan amendment was January 1
 2018
 unless an employee committed to their retirement date by December 31
 2017 and retired on or before December 31
As a result of these changes
 we remeasured the other postretirement benefit obligation as of August 23
 2017
.&#160;These remeasurements resulted in an aggregate non-cash
 pre-tax net prior service cost credit of 
 which is included in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 2017
