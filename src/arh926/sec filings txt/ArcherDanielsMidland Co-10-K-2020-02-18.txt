The Company continues to expand the size and global reach of its business through the development of new products.&#160;&#160;Acquisitions
 especially in the Nutrition segment
A significant majority of the Company&#8217;s raw materials are agricultural commodities.&#160;&#160;In addition
 the Company sources specific fruits
 vegetables
 and nuts for extracts to make flavors and colors.  In any single year
 the availability and price of these commodities are subject to factors such as changes in weather conditions
 plantings
 government programs and policies
 competition
 changes in global demand
 changes in standards of living
 and global production of similar and competitive crops.&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s raw materials are procured from thousands of growers
 grain elevators
 and wholesale merchants in North America
 South America

Seasonality
 Working Capital Needs
Since the Company is widely diversified in global agribusiness markets
 there are no material seasonal fluctuations in overall global processing volumes and the sale and distribution of its products and services.&#160;&#160;There is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles
 procurement
 and transportation of the Company&#8217;s principal raw materials: oilseeds
 corn
 wheat
The prices of agricultural commodities
 which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly
 directly affect the Company&#8217;s working capital requirements.&#160;&#160;Because the Company has a higher portion of its operations in the northern hemisphere
 principally North America and Europe
 relative to the southern hemisphere
 primarily South America
 inventory levels typically peak after the northern hemisphere fall harvest and are generally lower during the northern hemisphere summer months.&#160;&#160;Working capital requirements have historically trended with inventory levels.&#160;&#160;No material part of the Company&#8217;s business is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers.&#160;&#160;The Company has seasonal financing arrangements with farmers in certain countries around the world.&#160;&#160;Typically
The Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates based principally on price
 foreign exchange rates
 quality
 global supply
 and alternative products
 some of which are made from different raw materials than those utilized by the Company.&#160;&#160;Given the commodity-based nature of many of its businesses
 the Company
 on an ongoing basis
 focuses on managing unit costs and improving efficiency through technology improvements

The Company&#8217;s laboratories and technical innovation centers around the world enhance its ability to interact with customers globally
 not only to provide flavors
 but also to support the sales of other food ingredients.  The acquisition of Wild Flavors in October 2014 approximately doubled the number of scientists and technicians in research and development.  Since that time
 additional laboratories have been added
 including food &amp; beverages applications laboratories in Fort Collins
 Colorado
 and Bergamo
 Italy as well as expanded laboratories in Decatur
 Illinois and Shanghai

 the Company opened its new enzyme development laboratory in Davis
 California to advance the research and development of feed enzyme as well as enzymes for internal use.  In August 2018
 the Company further expanded its probiotics business with the acquisition of Probiotics International Limited.  With the acquisition of Neovia in early 2019
 ADM further expanded its R&amp;D capabilities in Animal Nutrition
 globally.  In December 2019
 the Company opened a new Animal Nutrition Technology Center in Decatur
 Illinois
ADM Ventures
 which was launched by the Company in 2016
 continues to select high-potential
 new product development projects from within its business units.  The first internal venture funded project
 a new sweetener
 has been fully commercialized and is being sold in the United States by our Carbohydrate Solutions team.  Through the acquisition of Neovia
 ADM Ventures further expanded its equity investments in promising
 early-stage start-up companies from three to six
The Company is continuing to invest in research to develop a broad range of sustainable materials with an objective to produce key intermediate materials that serve as a platform for producing a variety of sustainable packaging products.

A number of jurisdictions where the Company has operations have implemented or are in the process of implementing carbon pricing programs or regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions including
 but not limited to
 the U.S.
 Canada
 Mexico
 the E.U. and its member states
 and China.  The Company's operations located in countries with effective and applicable carbon pricing and regulatory programs currently meet their obligations in this regard with no significant impact on the earnings and competitive position of the Company.  The Company&#8217;s business could be affected in the future by additional global
 regional
 national
 and local regulation
 pricing of greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change legislation
 regulation or agreements.  It is difficult at this time to estimate the likelihood of passage
 or predict the potential impact
 of any additional legislation

The availability and prices of the agricultural commodities and agricultural commodity products the Company procures
 transports
 stores
 processes
 and merchandises can be affected by climate change
 weather conditions
 disease
 government programs
 competition
The availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations
 including impacts from factors outside the Company's control such as changes in weather
 climate
 and rising sea levels
 crop disease
 plantings
 government programs and policies
 competition
 and changes in global demand.&#160;&#160;The Company uses a global network of procurement
 processing
 and transportation assets
 as well as robust communications between global commodity merchandiser teams
 to continually assess price and basis opportunities.  Management-established limits (including a corporate wide value-at-risk metric)
 with robust internal reporting
 help to manage risks in pursuit of driving performance.  Additionally
Reduced supply of agricultural commodities could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s profitability by increasing the cost of raw materials and/or limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to procure
 transport
 store
 process
 and merchandise agricultural commodities in an efficient manner.  High and volatile commodity prices can place more pressures on short-term working capital funding.  Conversely
 if supplies are abundant and crop production globally outpaces demand for more than one or two crop cycles
Advances in technology
 such as seed and crop protection
 farming techniques
 storage and logistics
 and speed of information flow
 may reduce the significance of dislocations and arbitrage opportunities in the agricultural global markets
The Company faces significant competition in each of its businesses and has numerous competitors
 who can be different depending upon each of the business segments in which it participates.&#160;&#160;The Company competes for the acquisition of inputs such as agricultural commodities
 transportation services
 and other materials and supplies
 as well as for workforce and talent.  Competition impacts the Company&#8217;s ability to generate and increase its gross profit as a result of the following factors:&#160;&#160;Pricing of the Company&#8217;s products is partly dependent upon industry processing capacity
 which is impacted by competitor actions to bring idled capacity on-line
 build new production capacity or execute aggressive consolidation; many of the products bought and sold by the Company are global commodities or are derived from global commodities that are highly price competitive and
 in many cases
 subject to substitution; significant changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar
 particularly the currencies of major crop growing countries
 could also make goods and products of these countries more competitive than U.S. products; improved yields in different crop growing regions may reduce the reliance on origination territories in which the Company has a significant presence; and continued merger and acquisition activities resulting in further consolidations could result in greater cost competitiveness and global scale of certain players in the industry
 especially when acquirers are state-owned and/or backed by public funds and have profit and return objectives that may differ from publicly traded enterprises.  To compete effectively
 the Company focuses on improving efficiency in its production and distribution operations
 developing and maintaining appropriate market presence
 maintaining a high level of product safety and quality
In the case of the nutrition business
 while maintaining efficient and cost-effective operations are important
The Company&#8217;s operating costs and the selling prices of certain finished products are sensitive to changes in energy prices.&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s processing plants are powered principally by electricity
 natural gas
 and coal.&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s transportation operations are dependent upon diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products.&#160;&#160;Significant increases in the cost of these items
 including any consequences of regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases
The Company has certain finished products
 such as ethanol and biodiesel
 which are closely related to
 or may be substituted for
 petroleum products
 or in the case of ethanol
 blended into gasoline to increase octane content.  Therefore
 the selling prices of ethanol and biodiesel can be impacted by the selling prices of gasoline
 diesel fuel
 and other octane enhancers.&#160;&#160;A significant decrease in the price of gasoline
 diesel fuel
The Company is subject to economic downturns and regional economic volatilities
 of its procurement facilities are located in the United States
 the Company also has significant operations in both developed areas (such as Western Europe
 Canada
 and Brazil) and emerging market areas.  One of the Company&#8217;s strategies is to expand the global reach of its core model
 which may include expanding or developing its business in emerging market areas.  Both developed and emerging market areas are subject to impacts of economic downturns
 including decreased demand for the Company&#8217;s products
 and reduced availability of credit
 or declining credit quality of the Company&#8217;s suppliers
 customers
 and other counterparties.  In addition
 emerging market areas could be subject to more volatile operating conditions including
 but not limited to
 logistics limitations or delays
 labor-related challenges
 epidemic outbreaks
 limitations or regulations affecting trade flows
 local currency concerns
 and other economic and political instability.&#160;&#160;Political fiscal instability could generate intrusive regulations in emerging markets
 potentially creating unanticipated assessments of taxes
 fees
 increased risks of corruption
 etc.  Economic downturns and volatile market conditions could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operating results and ability to execute its long-term business strategies
 although the nature of many of the Company's products (i.e. food and feed ingredients) is less sensitive to demand reductions in any economic downcycles.  The Company mitigates this risk in many ways
 including country risk and exposure analysis
 government relations and tax compliance activities
The Company is subject to numerous laws
 regulations
The Company does business globally
 countries
 and is required to comply with laws and regulations administered by the United States federal government as well as state
 local
 and non-U.S. governmental authorities in areas including:  Accounting and income taxes
 anti-corruption
 anti-bribery
 global trade
 trade sanctions
 environmental
 product safety
 and handling and production of regulated substances.&#160;&#160;The Company frequently faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due.&#160;&#160;These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.  Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject the Company to administrative
 civil
 and criminal remedies
 including fines
 penalties
 disgorgement
 injunctions
 and recalls of its products
 and damage to its reputation.  Resolution of some of these tax disputes could take many years and interest and penalties may be accruing in the meantime
The production of the Company&#8217;s products uses materials which can create emissions of certain regulated substances
 including greenhouse gas emissions.&#160;&#160;The Company has programs and policies in place (e.g.
 Corporate Sustainability Program
 No-Deforestation Policy
 Environmental Policy
 etc.) to reduce its environmental footprint and to help ensure compliance with laws and regulations.  Implementation of these programs and policies sometimes requires acquisition of technology at a cost to the Company.  Failure to comply can have serious consequences
 including civil
 administrative
 and criminal penalties as well as a negative impact on the Company&#8217;s reputation
 business
 cash flows
In addition
 changes to regulations or implementation of additional regulations - for example
 the imposition of regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gases
Government policies
 mandates
Agricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies
 mandates
 regulations
 and trade agreements
 including taxes
 tariffs
 duties
 subsidies
 incentives
 foreign exchange rates
 and import and export restrictions
 including policies related to genetically modified organisms
 traceability standards
 product safety and labeling
 renewable fuels
 and low carbon fuel mandates.  These policies can influence the planting of certain crops; the location and size of crop production; whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded; the volume and types of imports and exports; the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials; the viability and volume of production of certain of the Company&#8217;s products; and industry profitability.&#160;&#160;For example
 changes in government policies or regulations of ethanol and biodiesel including
 but not limited to
 changes in the Renewable Fuel Standard program under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 in the United States
 can have an impact on the Company&#8217;s operating results.&#160;&#160;International trade regulations can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions.  Regulations of financial markets and instruments
 including the Dodd-Frank Act
 Consumer Protection Act
 and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation
 create uncertainty and may lead to additional risks and costs
 and could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s futures commission merchant business and its agricultural commodity risk management practices.  Future government policies may adversely affect the supply of
 demand for
The Company&#8217;s operating results could be affected by political instability and by changes in monetary
 fiscal
 trade
 and environmental policies
 laws
 regulations
 and acquisition approvals
 creating risks including
 but not limited to:  Changes in a country&#8217;s or region&#8217;s economic or political conditions (e.g. Brexit)
 local labor conditions and regulations
 and safety and environmental regulations; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; changes in the regulatory or legal environment; restrictions on currency exchange activities; currency exchange fluctuations; burdensome taxes and tariffs; enforceability of legal agreements and judgments; adverse tax
 administrative agency or judicial outcomes; and regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases.&#160;&#160;International risks and uncertainties
 including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism
 political hostilities
 and war
 could limit the Company&#8217;s ability to transact business in these markets.  There has been a recent increase in populism and nationalism in various countries around the world and the concept and benefits of free trade are being challenged.  The Company has benefited from the free flow of agricultural and food and feed ingredient products from the U.S. and other sources to markets around the world.  Increases in tariff and restrictive trade activities around the world (e.g.
 the U.S.-China trade dispute
The Company&#8217;s strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops it merchandises and processes
 expanding the global reach of its core model
 and expanding its value-added product portfolio.  Government policies including
 but not limited to
 antitrust and competition law
 trade restrictions
 food safety regulations
 sustainability requirements
 and traceability
The Company is subject to risks which include
 but are not limited to
 product safety or quality; launch of new products by other industries that can replace the functionalities of the Company's production; shifting consumer preferences; federal
 state
 and local regulations on manufacturing or labeling; socially acceptable farming practices; environmental
 health
 and safety regulations; and customer product liability claims.&#160;&#160;The liability which could result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by
 or could exceed liability insurance related to product liability and food safety matters maintained by the Company.&#160;&#160;The Company has a particularly strong capability and culture around occupational health and safety and food safety; however
 risks to the Company's reputation may exist due to potential negative publicity caused by product liability
 food safety
 occupational health and safety
Certain of the Company&#8217;s merchandised commodities and finished products are used as ingredients in livestock and poultry feed.&#160;&#160;The Company is subject to risks associated with economic
 product quality
 feed safety or other factors which may adversely affect the livestock and poultry businesses
 including the outbreak of disease in livestock and poultry
 for example African swine fever
 which could adversely affect demand for the Company&#8217;s products used as ingredients in feed.&#160;&#160;In addition
 as the Company increases its investment in flavors and ingredients businesses
The Company is exposed to potential business disruption including
 but not limited to
 disruption of transportation services
 supply of non-commodity raw materials used in its processing operations
 and other impacts resulting from acts of terrorism or war
 natural disasters
 severe weather conditions
The Company&#8217;s operations rely on dependable and efficient transportation services the disruption of which could result in difficulties supplying materials to the Company&#8217;s facilities and impair the Company&#8217;s ability to deliver products to its customers in a timely manner.&#160;&#160;The Company relies on access to navigable rivers and waterways in order to fulfill its transportation obligations more effectively.&#160;&#160;In addition
 if certain non-agricultural commodity raw materials
 such as water or certain chemicals used in the Company&#8217;s processing operations
 are not available
 the Company&#8217;s business could be disrupted.&#160;&#160;Any major lack of available water for use in certain of the Company&#8217;s processing operations could have a material adverse impact on operating results.&#160;&#160;Certain factors which may impact the availability of non-agricultural commodity raw materials are out of the Company&#8217;s control including
 but not limited to
 disruptions resulting from weather
 high river water conditions
 economic conditions
 manufacturing delays or disruptions at suppliers
 shortage of materials
 interruption of energy supply
The assets and operations of the Company could be subject to extensive property damage and business disruption from various events which include
 but are not limited to
 acts of terrorism (for example
 purposeful adulteration of the Company&#8217;s products)
 war
 natural disasters
 severe weather conditions
 accidents
 explosions
 and fires. The Company is continuing to enhance and deploy additional food safety and security procedures and controls to appropriately mitigate the risks of any adulteration of the Company&#8217;s products in the supply chain and finished products in production and distribution networks. In addition
 the Company conforms to management systems
The Company requires significant capital
 including continuing access to credit markets
 to operate its current business and fund its growth strategy.&#160; The Company&#8217;s working capital requirements
 including margin requirements on open positions on futures exchanges
 are directly affected by the price of agricultural commodities
 which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly.&#160;&#160;The Company also requires substantial capital to maintain and upgrade its extensive network of storage facilities
 processing plants
 refineries
 mills
 ports
 transportation assets
 and other facilities to keep pace with competitive developments
 technological advances
 regulations
 and changing safety standards in the industry.&#160; Moreover
 the expansion of the Company&#8217;s business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital.&#160;&#160;Access to credit markets and pricing of the Company&#8217;s capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies.&#160;&#160;Sufficient credit ratings allow the Company to access cost competitive tier one commercial paper markets.  If the Company is unable to maintain sufficiently high credit ratings
 access to these commercial paper and other debt markets and costs of borrowings could be adversely affected.&#160;&#160;If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing
 including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets
 it could restrict the Company&#8217;s current operations and its growth opportunities.  The Company manages this risk with constant monitoring of credit/liquidity metrics
 cash forecasting
LIBOR (London Interbank Offered rate) has been the subject of recent proposals for international reform and it is anticipated LIBOR will be discontinued or modified by the end of 2021.  The Company's variable rate debt
 credit facilities
 &#160;certain derivative agreements
 and commercial agreements may use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing interest rates.  While it is not possible to predict the consequences of discontinuation or modification of LIBOR at this time
 the Company's financing costs could be adversely or positively impacted.  Although the Company does not expect that a transition from LIBOR will have a material adverse impact on its financing costs
The Company has a Chief Risk Officer who oversees the ERM Program and regularly reports to the Board of Directors on the myriad of risks facing the Company and the Company's strategies for mitigating the risks.  The Company&#8217;s business is affected by fluctuations in agricultural commodity cash prices and derivative prices
 transportation costs
 energy prices
 interest rates
 foreign currency exchange rates
 and equity markets.&#160;&#160;The Company monitors position limits and counterparty risks and engages in other strategies and controls to manage these risks.  The Company regularly reports its aggregate commodity risk exposures to the Board of Directors through the ERM process.  The Company has an established commodity merchandising governance process that ensures proper position reporting and monitoring
 limits approvals
 and executes training on trade compliance
 commodity regulatory reporting controls
 and other policies.  The Company&#8217;s risk monitoring efforts may not be successful at detecting a significant risk exposure.&#160;&#160;If these controls and strategies are not successful in mitigating the Company&#8217;s exposure to these fluctuations
December&#160;31
.&#160;&#160;Risks related to these investments may include:  The financial strength of the investment partner; loss of revenues and cash flows to the investment partner and related gross profit; the inability to implement beneficial management strategies
 including risk management and compliance monitoring
 with respect to the investment&#8217;s activities; and the risk that the Company may not be able to resolve disputes with the partners.&#160;&#160;The Company may encounter unanticipated operating issues
 financial results
 or compliance and reputational risks related to these investments.  The Company mitigates this risk using controls and policies related to joint venture formation
 governance (including board of directors&#8217; representation)
 merger and acquisition integration management
The Company&#8217;s information technology (IT) systems
 processes
 and sites may suffer interruptions
 security breaches
The Company&#8217;s operations rely on certain key IT systems
 some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties
 to provide critical data connectivity
 information
 and services for internal and external users.&#160;&#160;These interactions include
 but are not limited to: Ordering and managing materials from suppliers; risk management activities; converting raw materials to finished products; inventory management; shipping products to customers; processing transactions; summarizing and reporting results of operations; human resources benefits and payroll management; and complying with regulatory
 legal or tax requirements.&#160;&#160;The Company is also in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis as part of its ongoing business transformation program
 which is expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes and the underlying systems environment.  This will allow the Company to mitigate the risk of instability in aging legacy systems.  Increased IT security and social engineering threats and more sophisticated computer crime
 including advanced persistent threats
 pose a potential risk to the security of the Company&#8217;s IT systems
 networks
 and services
 as well as the confidentiality
 availability
 and integrity of the Company&#8217;s third party data.  The Company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy
 data protection
 and data security
 including those related to the collection
 storage
 handling
 use
 disclosure
 transfer
 and security of personal data.  Compliance with and interpretation of data privacy regulations
 including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation implemented in 2018
 continues to evolve and any violation could subject the Company to legal claims
 regulatory penalties
 and damage to its reputation.  The Company has put in place security measures to prevent
 detect
 and mitigate cyber-based attacks
 and has instituted control procedures for cyber security incident responses and disaster recovery plans for its critical systems.  In addition
 the Company monitors this risk on an ongoing basis to detect and correct any breaches
 and reports metrics on the quality of the Company&#8217;s data security efforts and control environment to the highest level of management and to the Board of Directors.  However
 if the Company&#8217;s IT systems are breached
 damaged
 or cease to function properly due to any number of causes
 such as catastrophic events
 power outages
 security breaches
 or cyber-based attacks
 and the Company&#8217;s disaster recovery plans do not effectively mitigate the risks on a timely basis
 the Company may suffer significant interruptions in its ability to manage its operations
 loss of valuable data
 actual or threatened legal actions
 and damage to its reputation
 which may adversely impact the Company&#8217;s revenues
 operating results
The Company may fail to realize the benefits or experience delays in the execution of its growth strategy
 encompassing organic and inorganic initiatives
As the Company executes its growth strategy
 through both organic and inorganic growth
 it may encounter risks which could result in increased costs
 decreased revenues
 and delayed synergies.  Recent investments outside the U.S. include Neovia
 certain assets of Brazil-based Algar Agro
 Protexin
 Ziegler
 Rodelle
 Inc.
 and Yerbalatina.  Growth in new geographies outside the U.S. can expose the Company to volatile economic
 political
 and regulatory risks that may negatively impact its operations and ability to achieve its growth strategy.  Expanding businesses where the Company has limited presence may expose the Company to risks related to the inability to identify an appropriate partner or target and favorable terms
 inability to retain/hire strategic talent
 or integration risks that may require significant management resources that would have otherwise been available for ongoing growth or operational initiatives.  Acquisitions may involve unanticipated delays
 costs
 and other problems.  Due diligence performed prior to the acquisition may not identify a material liability or issue that could impact the Company's reputation or adversely affect results of operations resulting in a reduction of the anticipated acquisition benefits.  Additionally
 acquisitions may involve integration risks such as:  internal control effectiveness
 system integration risks
 the risk of impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangibles
 ability to retain acquired employees

The Company is routinely involved in a number of actual or threatened legal actions
 including those involving alleged personal injuries
 employment law
 product liability
 intellectual property
 environmental issues
 alleged tax liability (see Note 13 in Item 8 for information on income tax matters)
 and class actions.  The Company also routinely receives inquiries from regulators and other government authorities relating to various aspects of its business
 and at any given time
 the Company has matters at various stages of resolution.  The outcomes of these matters are not within the Company's complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time.  In some actions
 claimants seek damages
 as well as other relief
 including injunctive relief
 that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues. In accordance with applicable accounting standards
 the Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for material loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range
 and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other
 the minimum amount of the range is accrued.  If a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not known or probable
 and can be reasonably estimated
 the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  When determining the estimated loss or range of loss
 significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded.  Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict
 particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages
 with incomplete facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties
 fines

Effective July 1
 2019
 the Company changed its segment reporting to reflect the creation of the combined Ag Services and Oilseeds segment.  The former Origination and Oilseeds businesses were merged into a combined Ag Services and Oilseeds segment which enables the Company to better respond to market changes by integrating the supply and value chains and risk management
 while delivering significant simplification and efficiency to the day-to-day business.  As part of the Company&#8217;s efforts for a streamlined management structure
The Company&#8217;s operations are organized
 managed
 and classified into three reportable business segments: Ag Services and Oilseeds
 Carbohydrate Solutions
 and Nutrition.&#160;&#160;Each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered.&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s remaining operations are not reportable business segments
 as defined by the applicable accounting standard
 and are classified as Other.&#160;&#160;Financial information with respect to the Company&#8217;s reportable business segments is set forth in Note 17 of &#8220;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; included in Item 8 herein

 and Expand Strategically
 all supported by its Readiness effort.  During 2018
 the Company launched Readiness to drive new efficiencies and improve the customer experience in the Company&#8217;s existing businesses through a combination of data and analytics
 process simplification and standardization
 and behavioral and cultural change
 building upon its earlier 1ADM and operational excellence programs.  Readiness will also support the execution of the Company's growth strategies across its five key growth platforms:  Taste

The Company&#8217;s Ag Services and Oilseeds operations are principally agricultural commodity-based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity-based agricultural raw materials.  As a result
 changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold.  Therefore
 changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in margins or gross profit.  Thus
The Company&#8217;s Carbohydrate Solutions operations and Nutrition businesses also utilize agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials.  However
 in these operations
 agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in cost of products sold.  Therefore
 changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit.  Thus

 the local currency is the functional currency except certain significant subsidiaries in Switzerland where Euro is the functional currency
 and Brazil and Argentina where U.S. dollar is the functional currency.  Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods.  For the majority of the Company&#8217;s business activities in Brazil and Argentina
 the functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however
 certain transactions

December&#160;31
The Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company's operating results.  In Ag Services and Oilseeds
 sales volumes and margins were negatively impacted by challenging North American weather conditions
 in particular high water in the Mississippi river system in the first half of the year
 and the continuing global trade tensions with China.  Handling volumes in North America were impacted by the late harvest as planting was delayed due to spring flooding.  Continued good global meal demand resulted in strong global crushing volumes and solid margins.  South American origination volumes benefited from the U.S.-China trade dispute but were also impacted by softer Chinese demand due to the African swine fever impact on local feed demand and intermittent farmer selling.  Global demand and margins for refined oil and biodiesel remained solid.  In Carbohydrate Solutions
 demand and prices for sweeteners and starches remained solid in North America while co-product prices were stable.  Although ethanol demand remained steady in North America
 margins were severely pressured as U.S. industry ethanol production and stocks remained at high levels and U.S. exports to China ceased during the trade dispute.  The severe weather conditions in North America also adversely impacted operations in the Carbohydrate Solutions business unit.  Nutrition benefited from growing demand for flavors
 flavors systems
 human and pet health and wellness products
 and plant-based proteins but was negatively impacted by the African swine fever in Asia Pacific

.  Ag Services results were lower due to weaker North American grain margins and lower volumes
 in part due to challenging weather conditions and the U.S.-China trade tensions.  Results in the current period were negatively impacted by high water conditions in the first half of the year
 which limited grain movement and sales in North America.  Slow farmer selling and lower Chinese demand of South American origination
 in part due to African swine fever
 also impacted results.  Crushing results were strong but down compared to the prior year.  Lower executed crush margins around the globe drove lower results

 where applicable
Management believes that adjusted EPS

The Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company's operating results.  In 2018
 markets were volatile amid escalating global trade tensions including the announcement of tariffs on Chinese imports of U.S. soybeans.  In Ag Services and Oilseeds
 strong demand for feedstuffs in light of weather conditions in Northern Europe resulted in higher sales volumes and margins in destination markets
 and strong basis positions across commodities resulted in higher margins. South American origination volumes and margins benefited from stronger farmer selling.  Dry conditions in Argentina resulted in a smaller soybean crop
 which combined with continued good global meal demand
 resulted in strong global crushing margins and volumes.  Demand and margins for refined oil remained solid
 and biodiesel margins improved.  Excess global peanut supply resulted in weak peanut margins.  In Carbohydrate Solutions
 global demand and prices for starches and sweeteners remained solid in North America while co-product prices were stable.  U.S. ethanol industry production remained at high levels.  Although ethanol demand remained strong both in North America and export markets due to favorable gasoline blending economics and ethanol's continuing status as a competitive octane enhancer

 Compared to Year Ended December&#160;31
Net earnings attributable to controlling interests increased 13% or $0.2 billion
 to $1.8 billion.   Segment operating profit increased 29% or $0.7 billion

 a net gain on sales of assets and businesses
 and corn hedge timing effects.  Adjusted segment operating profit increased $0.7 billion to $3.4 billion due to an increase in sales prices and volumes of corn and meal
 improved margins in Ag Services and Oilseeds and Nutrition
 and the benefits of the 2017 biodiesel tax credit which was approved and received in the first quarter of 2018

The Company generally operates its production facilities

 to react to local supply and demand conditions. Processed volumes of oilseeds increased due to increasing global demand for oilseed products
 particularly meal
 and higher crushing volumes in North America due to the reduced soybean crop in Argentina.  The overall decrease in corn is primarily related to decreased current year processing after the reconfiguration of the Company&#8217;s Peoria

Revenues and cost of products sold in commodity merchandising and processing businesses are significantly correlated to the underlying commodity prices and volumes.  In periods of significant changes in commodity prices
 the underlying performance of the Company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold
 particularly in Ag Services and Oilseeds
Revenues increased $3.5 billion or 6%
 to $64.3 billion due principally to higher sales prices ($2.3 billion) and higher sales volumes ($1.2 billion).   The increase in sales prices and volumes was due primarily to increases in corn and soybean meal.  Ag Services and Oilseeds revenues increased 7% to $49.9 billion due to higher sales prices ($2.5 billion) and higher sales volumes ($0.8 billion). Carbohydrate Solutions revenues decreased 1% to $10.3 billion due to lower sales prices ($0.2 billion)
Cost of products sold increased $2.9 billion to $60.2 billion due principally to higher sales volumes and higher prices for commodities.  Included in cost of products sold in 2018 was a credit of $18 million from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves compared to $2 million in 2017.  Manufacturing expenses increased $0.2 billion to $5.4 billion due principally to increased energy cost

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $62 million to $518 million due to earnings from a new equity investment and higher earnings from the Company&#8217;s equity investments in CIP and Olenex
Other expense - net of $101 million increased $111 million from net income of $10 million.  Expense in 2018 included foreign exchange losses and a non-cash pension settlement charge of $117 million related to the purchase of a group annuity contract that irrevocably transferred the future benefit obligations and annuity administration for certain U.S. salaried retirees under the Company's ADM Retirement Plan.  These expenses were partially offset by gains on disposals of businesses

Ag Services and Oilseeds operating profit increased 64%.  Ag Services was up significantly year-over-year.  Global trade delivered strong results due to increased volumes
 strong margins
 and improved opportunities in the soybean and feedstuff value chain.  North American grain was up due to improved margins and higher volumes.  South America saw strong origination volumes and improving margins as farmer selling accelerated.  Crushing results increased due to a strong global demand and margin environment.  The reduced soybean crop in Argentina combined with continued good global meal demand resulted in strong crushing margins and volumes.  Refined Products and Other results were higher mainly due to the 2017 biodiesel tax credit of approximately $120 million which was approved and received in the first quarter of 2018
 solid biodiesel results
 and higher earnings from the Company&#8217;s investment in Olenex
Carbohydrate Solutions operating profit decreased 12%.  Starches and Sweeteners results decreased due to lower margins and volumes in liquid sweeteners mainly due to production issues in the Decatur
 Illinois corn complex partially offset by improved results from starches and dry sweeteners.  Bioproducts results were down as near record industry fuel ethanol inventories pressured margins and production issues in the Decatur
 IL corn complex increased costs
Nutrition operating profit increased 9%.  Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients results were up due to improved earnings across the segment and higher sales volumes related to contributions from new acquisitions and organic growth.  In Wild Flavors
 an improved portfolio mix boosted sales and margins.  Health and Wellness improved driven largely by increased contributions from bioactives.  Specialty Ingredients was up due to improved volumes and margins in proteins and increased sales in fibers partially offset by lower results in polyols.  Animal Nutrition was down due to operational issues in Decatur
Other operating profit increased 14% primarily due to stronger results from its futures commission brokerage business due to higher short-term interest rates

Corporate results were a net charge of $1.2 billion in 2018 compared to $0.9 billion in 2017.  The effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves resulted in a credit of $18 million in 2018 compared to a credit of $2 million in 2017.  Interest expense - net increased $11 million due to higher interest rates on short-term debt and higher borrowings
 partially offset by interest income related to a tax credit and lower-tax related expense.  Unallocated corporate costs increased $190 million due principally to higher performance-related compensation accruals
 increased pension and project-related expenses
 and railroad maintenance expense that has an offsetting benefit in income tax expense.  Adjustments related to acquisitions in 2018 related to expenses and losses on foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge certain acquisitions.

 see Note 4 in Item 8.&#160;&#160;Changes in the market values of these inventories and commodity contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.&#160;&#160;If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value
 amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.&#160;&#160;Additionally
 if market conditions change subsequent to year-end
The Company
 from time to time
 uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the purchase or sales price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month.  Assuming normal market conditions
 the change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been
 and is expected to continue to be
 highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item.&#160;&#160;Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income
 net of applicable income taxes
 and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings.&#160;&#160;If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item
The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence.&#160;&#160;These investments are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted
 where appropriate
 for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.&#160;&#160;Generally
 the minimum ownership threshold for asserting significant influence is 20% ownership of the investee.&#160;&#160;However
 the Company considers all relevant factors in determining its ability to assert significant influence including
 but not limited to
 ownership percentage
 board membership
 customer and vendor relationships
 and other arrangements.&#160;&#160;If management used a different accounting method for these investments
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the applicable accounting standards.  These standards prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements.  The Company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements tax positions determined more likely than not to be sustained upon examination
 based on the technical merits of the position.  The Company faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due.&#160;&#160;These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.&#160;&#160;In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions
 the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company.&#160;&#160;For example
 the Company has received tax assessments from tax authorities in Brazil
 Argentina
 and the Netherlands

 based in part upon advice from legal counsel
Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns where the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Company&#8217;s income statement.&#160;&#160;The realization of the Company&#8217;s deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions

 in 2018.  The Company elected to pay the one-time transition tax over eight years.  Because the Company&#8217;s undistributed foreign earnings and outside basis differences inherent in foreign entities continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations
The Act also contains new provisions related to Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) and Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) which were effective for fiscal year 2018.  The Company made an accounting policy election to treat GILTI as a period cost.  During 2018
 U.S. tax authorities issued proposed Treasury Regulations addressing some of the tax reform items that were effective in 2018.  The Company has recorded and will continue to record the impact of tax reform items as U.S. tax authorities issue Treasury Regulations and other guidance addressing tax reform-related changes.  It is also reasonable to expect that global taxing authorities will be reviewing their current legislation for potential modifications in reaction to the implementation of the Act.

The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring
 transporting
 storing
 processing
 and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.&#160;&#160;This business is global in nature and is highly capital-intensive.&#160;&#160;Both the availability of the Company&#8217;s raw materials and the demand for the Company&#8217;s finished products are driven by factors such as weather
 plantings
 government programs and policies
 changes in global demand
 changes in standards of living
 and global production of similar and competitive crops.&#160;&#160;These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Company&#8217;s raw materials and finished products.&#160;&#160;Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Company&#8217;s assets in terms of geographic location
 size
 and age of its facilities.&#160;&#160;The Company
 from time to time
 will also invest in equipment
 technology
 and companies related to new
 value-added products produced from agricultural commodities and products.&#160;&#160;These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective.&#160;&#160;Management evaluates the Company&#8217;s property
 plant
 and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.&#160;&#160;Assets are written down to fair value after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value.&#160;&#160;If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets

Business Combinations
The consideration transferred is allocated to various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the residual allocated to goodwill.  Fair values allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations require management to make significant judgments
 estimates
 and assumptions
 especially with respect to intangible assets.  Management makes estimates of fair values based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable.  These are estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.  The estimated fair values related to intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships
 trademarks
 and developed technology which are determined primarily using discounted cash flow models.  Estimates in the discounted cash flow models include
 but are not limited to
 certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g. revenue growth rates
 customer attrition rates
 and royalty rates).  These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.  During the measurement period
 which may take up to one year from the acquisition date
 adjustments due to changes in the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded as adjustments to the consideration transferred and related allocations.  Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
 whichever comes first
Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests.&#160;&#160;The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on October 1 or whenever there are indicators that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.&#160;&#160;The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 350
 
 which permits
 but does not require
 a company to qualitatively assess indicators of a reporting unit's fair value.  If after completing the qualitative assessment
 a company believes it is likely that a reporting unit is impaired
 a discounted cash flow analysis is prepared to estimate fair value.  Critical estimates in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit include
 but are not limited to
 future expected cash flows and discount rates.  Definite-lived intangible assets
 including capitalized expenses related to the Company's 1ADM program

 2019 and 2018
 respectively.  There were no impairment charges recorded for goodwill and intangible assets during the year ended December&#160;31
 2017 (see Note 18 in Item 8 for more information).  If management used different estimates and assumptions in its impairment tests
In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans
 management makes several estimates and assumptions
 including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities
 rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans
 rates of compensation increases
 employee turnover rates
 anticipated mortality rates
 and anticipated future health care costs.&#160;&#160;These estimates and assumptions are based on the Company&#8217;s historical experience combined with management&#8217;s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.&#160;&#160;Management also uses third-party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans.&#160;&#160;If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans
 the funded status of the plans could vary significantly
The Company uses the corridor approach when amortizing actuarial losses.  Under the corridor approach
 net unrecognized actuarial losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets are amortized over future periods.  For plans with little to no active participants
 the amortization period is the remaining average life expectancy of the participants.  For plans with active participants
The market risk inherent in the Company&#8217;s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Company&#8217;s net commodity position
 foreign currency exchange rates
The availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as changes in weather conditions
 crop disease
 plantings
 government programs and policies
 competition
 changes in global demand
 changes in customer preferences and standards of living
The Company manages its exposure to adverse price movements of agricultural commodities used for
 and produced in
 its business operations
 by entering into derivative and non-derivative contracts which reduce the Company&#8217;s overall short or long commodity position.&#160;&#160;Additionally
 the Company uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins.&#160;&#160;The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchange-traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities
 counterparty contract defaults
 and volatility of freight markets. In addition
 the Company
 from time-to-time
 enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed
 or sold
 in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been
 and are expected to continue to be
 highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed designated hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income
 net of applicable taxes
The Company&#8217;s commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories
 related purchase and sales contracts
 energy and freight contracts
 and exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts including contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements
The fair value of the Company&#8217;s commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing all of the commodity positions at quoted market prices for the period
 where available
 or utilizing a close proxy.&#160;&#160;The Company has established metrics to monitor the amount of market risk exposure
 which consist of volumetric limits
 and value-at-risk (VaR) limits. VaR measures the potential loss
 at a 95% confidence level
In addition to measuring the hypothetical loss resulting from an adverse two standard deviation move in market prices (assuming no correlations) over a one year period using VaR
 sensitivity analysis is performed measuring the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices.&#160;&#160;The highest

 the local currency is the functional currency except certain significant subsidiaries in Switzerland where Euro is the functional currency
 and Brazil and Argentina where U.S. dollar is the functional currency.&#160;&#160;To reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
 the Company enters into currency exchange contracts to minimize its foreign currency position related to transactions denominated primarily in Euro
 British pound
 Canadian dollar
 and Brazilian real currencies.&#160;&#160;These currencies represent the major functional or local currencies in which recurring business transactions occur.&#160;&#160;The Company also uses currency exchange contracts as hedges against amounts indefinitely invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.&#160;&#160;The currency exchange contracts used are forward contracts

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.&#160;&#160;All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.&#160;&#160;The Company consolidates all entities
 including variable interest entities (VIEs)
 in which it has a controlling financial interest.  For VIEs
 the Company assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary as defined under the applicable accounting standard.  Investments in affiliates
 including VIEs through which the Company exercises significant influence but does not control the investee and is not the primary beneficiary of the investee&#8217;s activities
 are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings since acquisition and are adjusted
 where appropriate
 for basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s portion of the results of certain affiliates and results of certain VIEs are included using the most recent available financial statements.&#160;&#160;In each case

 the Company changed its segment reporting to reflect the creation of the combined Ag Services and Oilseeds segment.  The former Origination and Oilseeds businesses were merged into a combined Ag Services and Oilseeds segment which enables the Company to better respond to market changes by integrating the supply and value chains and risk management
 while delivering significant simplification and efficiency to the day-to-day business.  As part of the Company&#8217;s efforts for a streamlined management structure

The Company determines fair value based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.&#160;The Company uses the market approach valuation technique to measure the majority of its assets and liabilities carried at fair value.&#160;&#160;Three levels are established within the fair value hierarchy that may be used to report fair value:  Level 1:&#160;&#160;Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2:  Observable inputs
 including Level 1 prices that have been adjusted; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are less active than traded exchanges; and other inputs that are observable or can be substantially corroborated by observable market data.  Level 3:  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are a significant component of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.&#160;&#160;In evaluating the significance of fair value inputs
 the Company generally classifies assets or liabilities as Level 3 when their fair value is determined using unobservable inputs that individually or when aggregated with other unobservable inputs
 represent more than 10% of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.&#160;&#160;Judgment is required in evaluating both quantitative and qualitative factors in the determination of significance for purposes of fair value level classification.&#160;&#160;Level 3 amounts can include assets and liabilities whose value is determined using pricing models
 discounted cash flow methodologies
 or similar techniques
Based on historical experience with the Company&#8217;s suppliers and customers
 the Company&#8217;s own credit risk and knowledge of current market conditions
 the Company does not view nonperformance risk to be a significant input to fair value for the majority of its forward commodity purchase and sale contracts.&#160;&#160;However
 in certain cases
 if the Company believes the nonperformance risk to be a significant input
 the Company records estimated fair value adjustments
In many cases
 a valuation technique used to measure fair value includes inputs from multiple levels of the fair value hierarchy.&#160;&#160;The lowest level of input that is a significant component of the fair value measurement determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy.&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment
The Company&#8217;s policy regarding the timing of transfers between levels
 including both transfers into and transfers out of Level 3
The Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in its consolidated balance sheet.&#160;&#160;Unrealized gains are reported as other current assets and unrealized losses are reported as accrued expenses and other payables.  The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e.
 gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and on the type of hedging relationship.&#160;&#160;The majority of the Company&#8217;s derivatives have not been designated as hedging instruments
 and as such
 changes in fair value of these derivatives are recognized in earnings immediately.&#160;&#160;For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments
 the Company designates the hedging instrument
 based upon the exposure being hedged
 as a fair value hedge
 a cash flow hedge
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges (i.e.
 hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk)
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using statutory rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recorded in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date under the law.  Applicable accounting standards prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements.    The Company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements tax positions determined more likely than not to be sustained upon examination
The Company classifies interest on income tax-related balances as interest expense and classifies tax-related penalties as selling

Business Combinations
The consideration transferred is allocated to various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the residual allocated to goodwill.  Fair values allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations require management to make significant judgments
 estimates
 and assumptions
 especially with respect to intangible assets.  Management makes estimates of fair values based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable.  These are estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.  The estimated fair values related to intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships
 trademarks
 and developed technology which are determined primarily using discounted cash flow models.  Estimates in the discounted cash flow models include
 but are not limited to
 certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g. revenue growth rates
 customer attrition rates
 and royalty rates).  These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.  During the measurement period
 which may take up to one year from the acquisition date
 adjustments due to changes in the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded as adjustments to the consideration transferred and the related allocations.

Effective January 1
 2019
 the Company adopted the new guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842
 (Topic 842)
 which superseded ASC Topic 840
.  Topic 842 requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases.  The Company adopted Topic 842 using the optional transition method that allows entities to forgo the comparative reporting requirements under the modified retrospective transition method.  In addition
contract components in all of its underlying asset categories
 as well as the optional transition practical expedient that permits entities to continue applying current accounting policy for land easements that existed as of or expired before January 1
 2019. The adoption of Topic 842 resulted in the recording of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of 
 respectively
 at January 1
 2019.  The new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated statement of earnings and had no impact on the consolidated statement of cash flows.  For more information about the adoption of Topic 842
Effective January 1
 2019
 the Company adopted the amended guidance of ASC Topic 220
(Topic 220)
 which allows the reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act)
 eliminating the stranded tax effects resulting from the Act and improving the usefulness of information reported to financial statement users.  In addition
 the Company is required to disclose: (1) a description of its accounting policy for releasing income tax effects from AOCI; (2) whether it elects to reclassify the stranded income tax effects from the Act; and (3) information about other income tax effects related to the application of the Act that are reclassified from AOCI to retained earnings
 if any.  The Company&#8217;s accounting policy is to release income tax effects from AOCI when individual units of account are sold
 terminated
 or extinguished.  However
Effective January 1
 2020
 the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Topic 326
 
 which is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring more timely recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations.  The amended guidance replaces today&#8217;s &#8220;incurred loss&#8221; approach with an &#8220;expected loss&#8221; model and requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience
 current conditions
 and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  The Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.  The Company evaluated its current methodology of estimating allowance for doubtful accounts and the risk profile of its receivable portfolio and developed a model that includes the qualitative and forecasting aspects of the &#8220;expected loss&#8221; model under the amended guidance.  The Company finalized its assessment of the impact of the amended guidance and expects to record an immaterial cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings at January 1

The Company principally generates revenue from merchandising and transporting agricultural commodities and manufactured products used as ingredients in food
 feed
 energy
 and industrial products.  Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with a customer
 and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties.  The Company follows a policy of recognizing revenue at a single point in time when it satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer.  The majority of the Company&#8217;s contracts with customers have one performance obligation and a contract duration of one year or less.  The Company applies the practical expedient in paragraph 10-50-14 of ASC 606
 (&#8220;Topic 606&#8221;) and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less.  For transportation service contracts
 the Company recognizes revenue over time as the barge

Shipping and handling costs related to contracts with customers for the sale of goods are accounted for as a fulfillment activity and are included in cost of products sold.  Accordingly
The Company does not include taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are (i) imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and (ii) collected from customers

The Ag Services and Oilseeds segment generates revenue from the sale of commodities
 from service fees for the transportation of goods
 and from the sale of products manufactured in its global processing facilities.  Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties.  Revenue is recognized when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control over a product or providing service to a customer.  For transportation service contracts
 the Company recognizes revenue over time as the barge
 ocean-going vessel
 truck
 rail
 or container freight moves towards its destination in accordance with the transfer of control guidance of  Topic 606.  The amount of revenue recognized follows the contractually specified price which may include freight or other contractually specified cost components.  For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of Topic 606
The Carbohydrate Solutions segment generates revenue from the sale of products manufactured at the Company&#8217;s global corn and wheat milling facilities around the world.  Revenue is recognized when control over products is transferred to the customer.  Products are shipped to customers from the Company&#8217;s various facilities and from its network of storage terminals.  The amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration specified in the contract which could include freight and other costs depending on the specific shipping terms of each contract.

Estimated fair values for inventories carried at market are based on exchange-quoted prices

For all periods presented
In some cases
 the price components that result in differences between exchange-traded prices and local prices for inventories and commodity purchase and sale contracts are observable based upon available quotations for these pricing components
 and in some cases
 the differences are unobservable.  These price components primarily include transportation costs and other adjustments required due to location
 quality
 or other contract terms.  In the table below
 these other adjustments are referred to as basis.  The changes in unobservable price components are impacted by specific local supply and demand characteristics at each facility and the overall market.  Factors such as substitute products

In certain of the Company&#8217;s principal markets
 the Company relies on price quotes from third parties to value its inventories and physical commodity purchase and sale contracts.&#160;&#160;These price quotes are generally not further adjusted by the Company in determining the applicable market price.&#160;&#160;In some cases
 availability of third-party quotes is limited to only one or two independent sources.&#160;&#160;In these situations
 absent other corroborating evidence
 the Company considers these price quotes as 100% unobservable and
 therefore
The majority of the Company&#8217;s derivative instruments have not been designated as hedging instruments.  The Company uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts to manage its net position of merchandisable agricultural product inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations in agricultural commodities and foreign currencies.&#160;&#160;The Company also uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins.&#160;&#160;The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchange-traded commodities futures contracts and the value of the underlying commodities
 counterparty contract defaults
 and volatility of freight markets.&#160;&#160;Derivatives

State income taxes
The low 2019 effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax credits
 including the 2018 and 2019 biodiesel tax credit and the railroad maintenance tax credit
 signed into law in December 2019.  The effective tax rate for 2018 included the 2017 biodiesel tax credit recorded in the first quarter of 2018 and the additional true-up adjustments related to the 2017 U.S. tax reform
The foreign rate differential was primarily due to lower tax rates from the Company's operations in Switzerland
 Asia
 and the Caribbean.  The Company&#8217;s foreign earnings
 which were taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate and were generated from these jurisdictions
 were

 and the minimum tax on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI)
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was enacted on December 22
 2017.  The income tax effects of changes in tax laws are recognized in the period when enacted.   The Act provides for numerous significant tax law changes and modifications with varying effective dates
 which include reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 
 creating a territorial tax system (with a one-time transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings)
 broadening the tax base
 and allowing for immediate capital expensing of certain qualified property. As a result
 the Company made a reasonable estimate of the effects on existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax
 and recognized a net provisional benefit of 
 which is included as a component of income tax expense in the year ended December 31
 on reserves previously established under ASC Subtopic 740-30
Income Taxes - Other Considerations or Special Areas
 in 2018.  The Company has elected to pay the one-time transition tax over eight years.  As of December 31
 2019
 the Company's remaining transition tax liability was 
 related to FDII in fiscal years 2019 and 2018
 respectively.  The Company made an accounting policy election to treat GILTI as a period cost.  During 2018
 U.S. tax authorities issued proposed Treasury Regulations addressing some of the tax reform items that were effective in 2018.  The Company has recorded and will continue to record the impact of tax reform items as U.S. tax authorities issue Treasury Regulations and other guidance addressing tax reform-related changes.  It is also reasonable to expect that global taxing authorities will be reviewing their current legislation for potential modifications in reaction to the implementation of the Act.

The Company is subject to income taxation and routine examinations in many jurisdictions around the world and frequently faces challenges regarding the amount of taxes due.&#160;&#160;These challenges include positions taken by the Company related to the timing
 nature
 and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various jurisdictions.  In its routine evaluations of the exposure associated with various tax filing positions
 the Company recognizes a liability
 when necessary
 for estimated potential tax owed by the Company in accordance with applicable accounting standards.  Resolution of the related tax positions
 through negotiations with relevant tax authorities or through litigation
 may take years to complete.&#160;&#160;Therefore
 it is difficult to predict the timing for resolution of tax positions and the Company cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these ongoing or future examinations.  However
 the Company does not anticipate that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease significantly in the next twelve months.&#160;&#160;Given the long periods of time involved in resolving tax positions
 the Company does not expect that the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits will have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s effective income tax rate in any given period.&#160;&#160;If the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits were recognized by the Company at one time
The Company&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary
 ADM do Brasil Ltda. (ADM do Brasil)
challenging the tax deductibility of commodity hedging losses and related expenses for the tax years 2004
 2006
December 31
ADM do Brasil enters into commodity hedging transactions that can result in gains
 which are included in ADM do Brasil&#8217;s calculation of taxable income in Brazil
 and losses
 which ADM do Brasil deducts from its taxable income in Brazil.  The Company has evaluated its tax position regarding these hedging transactions and concluded
 based upon advice from Brazilian legal counsel
 that it was appropriate to recognize both gains and losses resulting from hedging transactions when determining its Brazilian income tax expense.  Therefore
ADM do Brasil filed an administrative appeal for each of the assessments.  In January 2020
 the second-level administrative appeal panel found in favor of ADM do Brasil and cancelled the assessments.  While it is unclear if the BFRS will appeal
 the Company intends to vigorously defend its position against any appeal which could be made to the administrative panel or to a superior tax chamber.&#160; The Company expects to know if the ruling will be appealed during the first half of 2020.  Based upon the view of external counsel
 it is unlikely that the BFRS will be successful in appealing the matter.  While the Company believes its consolidated financial statements properly reflect the tax deductibility of these hedging losses
 the ultimate resolution of this matter could result in the future recognition of additional payments of

The Argentine tax authorities conducted a review of income and other taxes paid by large exporters and processors of cereals and other agricultural commodities resulting in allegations of income tax evasion.  The Company strongly believes that it has complied with all Argentine tax laws.  To date
 the Company has not received assessments for closed years subsequent to 2011
 considering that the statute of limitation for tax years 2012 and 2013 has expired.  However
 it cannot rule out receiving additional assessments challenging transfer prices used to price grain exports for years subsequent to 2014
 in interest (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates as of December 31
 2019).&#160; The Company believes that it has appropriately evaluated the transactions underlying these assessments
 and has concluded
 based on Argentine tax law
 that its tax position would be sustained
 and accordingly
In accordance with the accounting requirements for uncertain tax positions
 the Company has not recorded an uncertain tax liability for these assessments because it has concluded that it is more likely than not to prevail on the Brazil and Argentina matters based upon their technical merits and because the taxing jurisdictions&#8217; processes do not provide a mechanism for settling at less than the full amount of the assessment.  The Company&#8217;s consideration of these tax assessments requires judgments about the application of income tax regulations to specific facts and circumstances.  The final outcome of these matters cannot reliably be predicted
 may take many years to resolve

The Company is routinely involved in a number of actual or threatened legal actions
 including those involving alleged personal injuries
 employment law
 product liability
 intellectual property
 environmental issues
 alleged tax liability (see Note 13 for information on income tax matters)
 and class actions. The Company also routinely receives inquiries from regulators and other government authorities relating to various aspects of our business
 and at any given time
 the Company has matters at various stages of resolution.  The outcomes of these matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time.  In some actions
 claimants seek damages
 as well as other relief including injunctive relief
 that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues.  In accordance with applicable accounting standards
 the Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for material loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range
 and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other
 the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not known or probable
 and can be reasonably estimated
 the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  When determining the estimated loss or range of loss
 significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded.  Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict
 particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages
 with incomplete facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties

The Company has been a party to numerous lawsuits pending in various U.S. state and federal courts arising out of Syngenta Corporation&#8217;s (&#8220;Syngenta&#8221;) marketing and distribution of genetically modified corn products in the U.S.  First
 the Company brought a state court action in Louisiana against Syngenta in 2014
 alleging Syngenta was negligent in commercializing its products before the products were approved in China.  In December 2017
 the Company and Syngenta reached a confidential settlement of this action.  Second
 Syngenta brought third-party claims against the Company in 2015 in a federal multidistrict litigation (&#8220;MDL&#8221;) in Kansas City
 Kansas
 consolidated state court litigation in Minneapolis
 Minnesota
 and other courts
 seeking contribution in the event Syngenta is held liable in class actions by farmers and other parties.  In the December 2017 settlement
 Syngenta agreed to dismiss all of these third-party claims against the Company.  Third
 farmers and other parties have sued the Company and other grain companies in numerous individual and purported class action suits in Illinois state and federal courts beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015
 alleging the Company and other grain companies were negligent in failing to screen for genetically modified corn.  All of these claims were dismissed
 subject to appeal
 in several orders entered on August 17
 2016 by the federal court in Minneapolis on January 4
 2017 by the federal court in the Southern District of Illinois
 and on August 18
 2017 by a state court in Illinois.  Subsequently in 2019
 a number of additional plaintiffs filed substantially similar claims against the Company and other grain companies in the same Illinois state court.  The Company has filed a motion to apply the court's prior dismissal order to these additional complaints
 which motion the court has indicated it will grant upon submission of a proposed order from the parties.  Thus
 pending the anticipated application of the prior dismissal order to the additional Illinois state court complaints and subject to appeals
 the Company will not be a defendant in any remaining actions.  The Company denies liability in all of the actions in which it has been named as a defendant or third-party defendant and will vigorously defend itself on appeal in these cases.  At this time
 the Company is unable to predict the final outcome of this matter with any reasonable degree of certainty
 but believes the outcome will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition

AOT alleges that members of the putative class suffered &#8220;hundreds of millions of dollars in damages&#8221; as a result of the Company&#8217;s alleged actions.&#160; The Company filed a motion to dismiss this suit in November 2019
 and that motion is awaiting decision by the court.  The Company denies liability

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error or fraud.  Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining
 on a test basis
 evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging
 subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements
 taken as a whole
 and we are not

As explained in Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements
 the estimated fair values for inventories carried at market and forward commodity purchase and sale contracts are based on exchange-quoted prices adjusted for differences in local markets and/or quality
 referred to as basis.  Market valuations for inventories or fair values for forward commodity purchase and sales contracts are adjusted for location and quality differences (basis) because the exchange-quoted prices represent contracts that have standardized terms for commodity
 quantity
 future delivery period
 delivery location
 and commodity quality or grade. The stated fair values as of December 31
 2019 for inventories
 commodity contracts in an asset position
 and commodity contracts in a liability position were $4
704 million
 $478 million and $574 million
Auditing the estimated fair values for inventories carried at market and forward commodity purchase and sale contracts is complex due to the judgment involved in determining market prices
 specifically related to determining the estimated basis adjustment.  The basis adjustment is impacted by specific local supply and demand characteristics at each facility and the overall market.&#160;&#160;Factors such as substitute products
 weather
 fuel costs
 contract terms
We obtained an understanding
To test the estimated fair values of inventories carried at market and forward commodity purchase and sale contracts
 our audit procedures included
 among others
 evaluating (i) the Company's selection of the principal market
 (ii) the inputs for the basis adjustments
 and (iii) the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the basis adjustments.  For example
 we evaluated management&#8217;s methodology for determining the basis adjustment such as assessing the principal market identified and sources utilized by management to support the basis adjustment.  Specifically
 we compared the basis adjustments used by management to broker quotes
 trade publications
 and/or recent trade prices
 including recently executed transactions.  Further
 we investigated
 to the extent necessary
 basis adjustments that were inconsistent with third party
 available information.  Finally

 the Company completed its acquisition of Neovia for net consideration of $1

Auditing the Company's accounting for its acquisition of Neovia was complex due to the significant judgments
 estimates and assumptions made by management with respect to intangible assets. Intangible assets related to Neovia were approximately $669 million at December 31
 2019
 which principally consisted of trademarks/brands
 customer lists
 and other intellectual property and were determined primarily using discounted cash flow models.  Estimates in the discounted cash flow models include
 but are not limited to
 certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g.
 revenue growth rates
We obtained an understanding
To test the estimated fair values of the intangible assets

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
 assessing the risk that a material weakness exists
 testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk
A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.&#160;&#160;Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions

 the Company&#8217;s management

Topic 842 requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases.  The Company adopted Topic 842 using the optional transition method that allows entities to forgo the comparative reporting requirements under the modified retrospective transition method.  In addition, the Company elected to apply the package of practical expedients that allows entities to forgo reassessing at the transition date:  (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases; (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases; and (3) whether unamortized initial direct costs for existing leases meet the definition of initial direct costs under the new guidance.  The Company also elected to use the practical expedient that allows the combination of lease and non-lease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=font-family:Calibri

 the Company announced an enhanced early retirement for some eligible employees in the U.S. and Canada.   As a result
In October 2018

 retirees from the Plan to Prudential.  The purchase of the group annuity contract
 which was funded directed by the Plan&#8217;s assets
 was completed on November 2
.  As a result of the transaction
In July 2017
 the Company announced that all participants in the Company&#8217;s U.S. salaried pension plan and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) will begin accruing benefits under the cash balance formula effective January 1
 2022.  Benefits for participants who were accruing under the final average pay formula will be frozen as of December 31
 2021

The Company determines fair value based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.&#160;The Company uses the market approach valuation technique to measure the majority of its assets and liabilities carried at fair value.&#160;&#160;Three levels are established within the fair value hierarchy that may be used to report fair value:  Level 1:&#160;&#160;Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2:  Observable inputs
 including Level 1 prices that have been adjusted; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are less active than traded exchanges; and other inputs that are observable or can be substantially corroborated by observable market data.  Level 3:  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are a significant component of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.&#160;&#160;In evaluating the significance of fair value inputs
 the Company generally classifies assets or liabilities as Level 3 when their fair value is determined using unobservable inputs that individually or when aggregated with other unobservable inputs
 represent more than 10% of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.&#160;&#160;Judgment is required in evaluating both quantitative and qualitative factors in the determination of significance for purposes of fair value level classification.&#160;&#160;Level 3 amounts can include assets and liabilities whose value is determined using pricing models
 discounted cash flow methodologies
 or similar techniques
Based on historical experience with the Company&#8217;s suppliers and customers
 the Company&#8217;s own credit risk and knowledge of current market conditions
 the Company does not view nonperformance risk to be a significant input to fair value for the majority of its forward commodity purchase and sale contracts.&#160;&#160;However
 in certain cases
 if the Company believes the nonperformance risk to be a significant input
 the Company records estimated fair value adjustments
In many cases
 a valuation technique used to measure fair value includes inputs from multiple levels of the fair value hierarchy.&#160;&#160;The lowest level of input that is a significant component of the fair value measurement determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy.&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment
The Company&#8217;s policy regarding the timing of transfers between levels
 including both transfers into and transfers out of Level 3
The Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in its consolidated balance sheet.&#160;&#160;Unrealized gains are reported as other current assets and unrealized losses are reported as accrued expenses and other payables.  The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e.
 gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and on the type of hedging relationship.&#160;&#160;The majority of the Company&#8217;s derivatives have not been designated as hedging instruments
 and as such
 changes in fair value of these derivatives are recognized in earnings immediately.&#160;&#160;For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments
 the Company designates the hedging instrument
 based upon the exposure being hedged
 as a fair value hedge
 a cash flow hedge
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges (i.e.
 hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk)
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using statutory rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recorded in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date under the law.  Applicable accounting standards prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements.    The Company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements tax positions determined more likely than not to be sustained upon examination

The Company&#8217;s acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805
Business Combinations
The consideration transferred is allocated to various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the residual allocated to goodwill.  Fair values allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations require management to make significant judgments
 estimates
 and assumptions
 especially with respect to intangible assets.  Management makes estimates of fair values based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable.  These are estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.  The estimated fair values related to intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships
 trademarks
 and developed technology which are determined primarily using discounted cash flow models.  Estimates in the discounted cash flow models include
 but are not limited to
 certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g. revenue growth rates
 customer attrition rates
 and royalty rates).  These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.  During the measurement period
 which may take up to one year from the acquisition date
 adjustments due to changes in the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded as adjustments to the consideration transferred and the related allocations.  Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed

Effective January 1
 2019
 the Company adopted the new guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842
 (Topic 842)
 which superseded ASC Topic 840
.  Topic 842 requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases.  The Company adopted Topic 842 using the optional transition method that allows entities to forgo the comparative reporting requirements under the modified retrospective transition method.  In addition
contract components in all of its underlying asset categories
 as well as the optional transition practical expedient that permits entities to continue applying current accounting policy for land easements that existed as of or expired before January 1
 2019. The adoption of Topic 842 resulted in the recording of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of 
 respectively
 at January 1
 2019.  The new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated statement of earnings and had no impact on the consolidated statement of cash flows.  For more information about the adoption of Topic 842
Effective January 1
 2019
 the Company adopted the amended guidance of ASC Topic 220
(Topic 220)
 which allows the reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act)
 eliminating the stranded tax effects resulting from the Act and improving the usefulness of information reported to financial statement users.  In addition
 the Company is required to disclose: (1) a description of its accounting policy for releasing income tax effects from AOCI; (2) whether it elects to reclassify the stranded income tax effects from the Act; and (3) information about other income tax effects related to the application of the Act that are reclassified from AOCI to retained earnings
 if any.  The Company&#8217;s accounting policy is to release income tax effects from AOCI when individual units of account are sold
 terminated
 or extinguished.  However
Effective January 1
 2020
 the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Topic 326
 
 which is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring more timely recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations.  The amended guidance replaces today&#8217;s &#8220;incurred loss&#8221; approach with an &#8220;expected loss&#8221; model and requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience
 current conditions
 and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  The Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.  The Company evaluated its current methodology of estimating allowance for doubtful accounts and the risk profile of its receivable portfolio and developed a model that includes the qualitative and forecasting aspects of the &#8220;expected loss&#8221; model under the amended guidance.  The Company finalized its assessment of the impact of the amended guidance and expects to record an immaterial cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings at January 1
Effective January 1
 2020
 the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Topic 820
 
Effective December 31
 2020
 the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Subtopic 715-20
 
Effective January 1
 2021
 the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Topic 740
(Topic 740)
 which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of the amended guidance on the consolidated financial statements but does not expect the adoption of the amendments to have a significant impact on its financial results.

Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.

ADM is a global leader in human and animal nutrition and one of the world&#8217;s premier agricultural origination and processing company.  It is one of the world&#8217;s leading producers of ingredients for human and animal nutrition
 and other products made from nature.




The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.&#160;&#160;All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.&#160;&#160;The Company consolidates all entities
 including variable interest entities (VIEs)
 in which it has a controlling financial interest.  For VIEs
 the Company assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary as defined under the applicable accounting standard.  Investments in affiliates
 including VIEs through which the Company exercises significant influence but does not control the investee and is not the primary beneficiary of the investee&#8217;s activities
 are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings since acquisition and are adjusted
 where appropriate
 for basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s portion of the results of certain affiliates and results of certain VIEs are included using the most recent available financial statements.&#160;&#160;In each case
 the financial statements are within 93 days of the Company&#8217;s year-end and are consistent from period to period.&#160;&#160;









Effective July 1
 2019
 the Company changed its segment reporting to reflect the creation of the combined Ag Services and Oilseeds segment.  The former Origination and Oilseeds businesses were merged into a combined Ag Services and Oilseeds segment which enables the Company to better respond to market changes by integrating the supply and value chains and risk management
 while delivering significant simplification and efficiency to the day-to-day business.  As part of the Company&#8217;s efforts for a streamlined management structure
 the combined segment is led by the former President of Oilseeds expanding his role to President of Ag Services and Oilseeds.  




The Company considers all non-segregated
 highly-liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.




The Company segregates certain cash
 cash equivalents
 and investment balances in accordance with regulatory requirements
 commodity exchange requirements
 and insurance arrangements.  These balances represent deposits received from customers of the Company&#8217;s registered futures commission merchant and commodity brokerage services
 cash margins and securities pledged to commodity exchange clearinghouses
 and cash pledged as security under certain insurance arrangements.  Segregated cash and investments also include restricted cash collateral for the various insurance programs of the Company&#8217;s captive insurance business.    To the degree these segregated balances are comprised of cash and cash equivalents
 they are considered restricted cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows.

 to reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts receivable balances.&#160;&#160;The Company estimates this allowance based on its history of write-offs
 level of past-due accounts
 and its relationships with
 and the economic status of
 its customers.&#160;&#160;Portions of the allowance for uncollectible accounts are recorded in trade receivables
 other current assets
Credit risk on receivables is minimized as a result of the large and diversified nature of the Company&#8217;s worldwide customer base.&#160;&#160;The Company manages its exposure to counter-party credit risk through credit analysis and approvals
 credit limits
December&#160;31
 2019
 respectively.




Inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities
 which include inventories acquired under deferred pricing contracts
 are stated at market value.&#160;&#160;In addition
 the Company values certain inventories using the lower of cost
 determined by either the first-in
 first-out (FIFO) or last-in
 first-out (LIFO) methods
 or net realizable value.




The Company determines fair value based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.&#160;The Company uses the market approach valuation technique to measure the majority of its assets and liabilities carried at fair value.&#160;&#160;Three levels are established within the fair value hierarchy that may be used to report fair value:  Level 1:&#160;&#160;Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2:  Observable inputs
 including Level 1 prices that have been adjusted; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are less active than traded exchanges; and other inputs that are observable or can be substantially corroborated by observable market data.  Level 3:  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are a significant component of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.&#160;&#160;In evaluating the significance of fair value inputs
 the Company generally classifies assets or liabilities as Level 3 when their fair value is determined using unobservable inputs that individually or when aggregated with other unobservable inputs
 represent more than 10% of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.&#160;&#160;Judgment is required in evaluating both quantitative and qualitative factors in the determination of significance for purposes of fair value level classification.&#160;&#160;Level 3 amounts can include assets and liabilities whose value is determined using pricing models
 discounted cash flow methodologies
 or similar techniques
Based on historical experience with the Company&#8217;s suppliers and customers
 the Company&#8217;s own credit risk and knowledge of current market conditions
 the Company does not view nonperformance risk to be a significant input to fair value for the majority of its forward commodity purchase and sale contracts.&#160;&#160;However
 in certain cases
 if the Company believes the nonperformance risk to be a significant input
 the Company records estimated fair value adjustments
In many cases
 a valuation technique used to measure fair value includes inputs from multiple levels of the fair value hierarchy.&#160;&#160;The lowest level of input that is a significant component of the fair value measurement determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy.&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment
The Company&#8217;s policy regarding the timing of transfers between levels
 including both transfers into and transfers out of Level 3
 is to measure and record the transfers at the end of the reporting period.&#160;&#160;




The Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in its consolidated balance sheet.&#160;&#160;Unrealized gains are reported as other current assets and unrealized losses are reported as accrued expenses and other payables.  The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e.
 gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and on the type of hedging relationship.&#160;&#160;The majority of the Company&#8217;s derivatives have not been designated as hedging instruments
 and as such
 changes in fair value of these derivatives are recognized in earnings immediately.&#160;&#160;For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments
 the Company designates the hedging instrument
 based upon the exposure being hedged
 as a fair value hedge
 a cash flow hedge
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges (i.e.
 hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk)
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges
 changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the current period.

The Company generally uses the straight-line method in computing depreciation for financial reporting purposes and generally uses accelerated methods for income tax purposes. The annual provisions for depreciation have been computed principally in accordance with the following ranges of asset lives: buildings - 
 
December&#160;31
 2019
 
 and 
 respectively.




The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using statutory rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recorded in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date under the law.  Applicable accounting standards prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements.    The Company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements tax positions determined more likely than not to be sustained upon examination
The Company classifies interest on income tax-related balances as interest expense and classifies tax-related penalties as selling
 general
 and administrative expenses.




Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests.&#160;&#160;Definite-lived intangible assets
 including capitalized expenses related to the Company's 1ADM program
 related to goodwill and intangibles
 related to customer lists during the years ended December&#160;31
 2019 and 2018

 2017 (see Note 9 for additional information).




The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.&#160;&#160;Assets are written down to fair value after consideration of the Company&#8217;s ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose

The Company follows a policy of recognizing revenue at a single point in time when it satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer.  For transportation service contracts
 the Company recognizes revenue over time as the barge
 ocean-going vessel
 truck
 rail
 or container freight moves towards its destination in accordance with the transfer of control guidance of ASC Topic 606
 (Topic 606).  For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of Topic 606
 the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by ASC 610-20
The Company principally generates revenue from merchandising and transporting agricultural commodities and manufactured products used as ingredients in food
 feed
 energy
 and industrial products.  Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with a customer
 and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties.  The Company follows a policy of recognizing revenue at a single point in time when it satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer.  The majority of the Company&#8217;s contracts with customers have one performance obligation and a contract duration of one year or less.  The Company applies the practical expedient in paragraph 10-50-14 of ASC 606
 (&#8220;Topic 606&#8221;) and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less.  For transportation service contracts
 the Company recognizes revenue over time as the barge
 ocean-going vessel
 truck
 rail
 for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.  For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of Topic 606
 the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by ASC 610-20
Shipping and handling costs related to contracts with customers for the sale of goods are accounted for as a fulfillment activity and are included in cost of products sold.  Accordingly
The Company does not include taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are (i) imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and (ii) collected from customers
 in the measurement of transactions prices or as a component of revenues and cost of products sold.




The Company recognizes expense for its stock compensation based on the fair value of the awards that are granted.&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s stock compensation plans provide for the granting of restricted stock
 restricted stock units
 performance stock units
 and stock options.&#160;&#160;The fair values of stock options and performance stock units are estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and a lattice valuation model
 respectively.&#160;&#160;These valuation models require the input of subjective assumptions.&#160;&#160;Measured compensation cost
 net of forfeitures
 is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the related stock compensation award.




Costs associated with research and development are expensed as incurred.&#160;&#160;Such costs incurred
 net of expenditures subsequently reimbursed by government grants
 were 
 
December&#160;31
 2019
 
 and 
 respectively.




Basic earnings per common share are determined by dividing net earnings attributable to controlling interests by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.&#160;&#160;In computing diluted earnings per share
 average number of common shares outstanding is increased by common stock options outstanding with exercise prices lower than the average market price of common shares using the treasury share method.




The Company&#8217;s acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805
Business Combinations
The consideration transferred is allocated to various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the residual allocated to goodwill.  Fair values allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations require management to make significant judgments
 estimates
 and assumptions
 especially with respect to intangible assets.  Management makes estimates of fair values based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable.  These are estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.  The estimated fair values related to intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships
 trademarks
 and developed technology which are determined primarily using discounted cash flow models.  Estimates in the discounted cash flow models include
 but are not limited to
 certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g. revenue growth rates
 customer attrition rates
 and royalty rates).  These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.  During the measurement period
 which may take up to one year from the acquisition date
 adjustments due to changes in the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded as adjustments to the consideration transferred and the related allocations.  Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
 whichever comes first
 any such adjustments are charged to the consolidated statements of earnings.




Effective January 1
 2019
 the Company adopted the new guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842
 (Topic 842)
 which superseded ASC Topic 840
.  Topic 842 requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases.  The Company adopted Topic 842 using the optional transition method that allows entities to forgo the comparative reporting requirements under the modified retrospective transition method.  In addition
contract components in all of its underlying asset categories
 as well as the optional transition practical expedient that permits entities to continue applying current accounting policy for land easements that existed as of or expired before January 1
 2019. The adoption of Topic 842 resulted in the recording of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of 
 respectively
 at January 1
 2019.  The new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated statement of earnings and had no impact on the consolidated statement of cash flows.  For more information about the adoption of Topic 842
Effective January 1
 2019
 the Company adopted the amended guidance of ASC Topic 220
(Topic 220)
 which allows the reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act)
 eliminating the stranded tax effects resulting from the Act and improving the usefulness of information reported to financial statement users.  In addition
 the Company is required to disclose: (1) a description of its accounting policy for releasing income tax effects from AOCI; (2) whether it elects to reclassify the stranded income tax effects from the Act; and (3) information about other income tax effects related to the application of the Act that are reclassified from AOCI to retained earnings
 if any.  The Company&#8217;s accounting policy is to release income tax effects from AOCI when individual units of account are sold
 terminated
 or extinguished.  However
 the Company has elected to not release from AOCI the stranded income tax effects resulting from the Act. 




Effective January 1
 2020
 the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Topic 326
 
 which is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring more timely recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations.  The amended guidance replaces today&#8217;s &#8220;incurred loss&#8221; approach with an &#8220;expected loss&#8221; model and requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience
 current conditions
 and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  The Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.  The Company evaluated its current methodology of estimating allowance for doubtful accounts and the risk profile of its receivable portfolio and developed a model that includes the qualitative and forecasting aspects of the &#8220;expected loss&#8221; model under the amended guidance.  The Company finalized its assessment of the impact of the amended guidance and expects to record an immaterial cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings at January 1
Effective January 1
 2020
 the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Topic 820
 
Effective December 31
 2020
 the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Subtopic 715-20
 
Effective January 1
 2021
 the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Topic 740
(Topic 740)
 which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of the amended guidance on the consolidated financial statements but does not expect the adoption of the amendments to have a significant impact on its financial results.

State income taxes
The low 2019 effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax credits
 including the 2018 and 2019 biodiesel tax credit and the railroad maintenance tax credit
 signed into law in December 2019.  The effective tax rate for 2018 included the 2017 biodiesel tax credit recorded in the first quarter of 2018 and the additional true-up adjustments related to the 2017 U.S. tax reform
The foreign rate differential was primarily due to lower tax rates from the Company's operations in Switzerland
 Asia
 and the Caribbean.  The Company&#8217;s foreign earnings
 which were taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate and were generated from these jurisdictions
 were 
 
 and

 the U.S. tax on undistributed Subpart F
 and the minimum tax on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI)
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was enacted on December 22
 2017.  The income tax effects of changes in tax laws are recognized in the period when enacted.   The Act provides for numerous significant tax law changes and modifications with varying effective dates
 which include reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 
 creating a territorial tax system (with a one-time transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings)
 broadening the tax base
 and allowing for immediate capital expensing of certain qualified property. As a result
 the Company made a reasonable estimate of the effects on existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax
 and recognized a net provisional benefit of 
 which is included as a component of income tax expense in the year ended December 31
 on reserves previously established under ASC Subtopic 740-30
Income Taxes - Other Considerations or Special Areas
 in 2018.  The Company has elected to pay the one-time transition tax over eight years.  As of December 31
 2019
 the Company's remaining transition tax liability was 
 related to FDII in fiscal years 2019 and 2018
 respectively.  The Company made an accounting policy election to treat GILTI as a period cost.  During 2018
 U.S. tax authorities issued proposed Treasury Regulations addressing some of the tax reform items that were effective in 2018.  The Company has recorded and will continue to record the impact of tax reform items as U.S. tax authorities issue Treasury Regulations and other guidance addressing tax reform-related changes.  It is also reasonable to expect that global taxing authorities will be reviewing their current legislation for potential modifications in reaction to the implementation of the Act.

The Company is subject to income taxation and routine examinations in many jurisdictions around the world and frequently faces challenges regarding the amount of taxes due.&#160;&#160;These challenges include positions taken by the Company related to the timing
 nature
 and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various jurisdictions.  In its routine evaluations of the exposure associated with various tax filing positions
 the Company recognizes a liability
 when necessary
 for estimated potential tax owed by the Company in accordance with applicable accounting standards.  Resolution of the related tax positions
 through negotiations with relevant tax authorities or through litigation
 may take years to complete.&#160;&#160;Therefore
 it is difficult to predict the timing for resolution of tax positions and the Company cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these ongoing or future examinations.  However
 the Company does not anticipate that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease significantly in the next twelve months.&#160;&#160;Given the long periods of time involved in resolving tax positions
 the Company does not expect that the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits will have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s effective income tax rate in any given period.&#160;&#160;If the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits were recognized by the Company at one time
The Company&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary
 ADM do Brasil Ltda. (ADM do Brasil)
challenging the tax deductibility of commodity hedging losses and related expenses for the tax years 2004
 2006
December 31
ADM do Brasil enters into commodity hedging transactions that can result in gains
 which are included in ADM do Brasil&#8217;s calculation of taxable income in Brazil
 and losses
 which ADM do Brasil deducts from its taxable income in Brazil.  The Company has evaluated its tax position regarding these hedging transactions and concluded
 based upon advice from Brazilian legal counsel
 that it was appropriate to recognize both gains and losses resulting from hedging transactions when determining its Brazilian income tax expense.  Therefore
ADM do Brasil filed an administrative appeal for each of the assessments.  In January 2020
 the second-level administrative appeal panel found in favor of ADM do Brasil and cancelled the assessments.  While it is unclear if the BFRS will appeal
 the Company intends to vigorously defend its position against any appeal which could be made to the administrative panel or to a superior tax chamber.&#160; The Company expects to know if the ruling will be appealed during the first half of 2020.  Based upon the view of external counsel
 it is unlikely that the BFRS will be successful in appealing the matter.  While the Company believes its consolidated financial statements properly reflect the tax deductibility of these hedging losses
 the ultimate resolution of this matter could result in the future recognition of additional payments of
 and expense for

 in interest (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates).  The Argentine tax authorities conducted a review of income and other taxes paid by large exporters and processors of cereals and other agricultural commodities resulting in allegations of income tax evasion.  The Company strongly believes that it has complied with all Argentine tax laws.  To date
 the Company has not received assessments for closed years subsequent to 2011
 considering that the statute of limitation for tax years 2012 and 2013 has expired.  However
 it cannot rule out receiving additional assessments challenging transfer prices used to price grain exports for years subsequent to 2014
 in interest (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates as of December 31
 2019).&#160; The Company believes that it has appropriately evaluated the transactions underlying these assessments
 and has concluded
 based on Argentine tax law
 that its tax position would be sustained
 and accordingly
In accordance with the accounting requirements for uncertain tax positions
 the Company has not recorded an uncertain tax liability for these assessments because it has concluded that it is more likely than not to prevail on the Brazil and Argentina matters based upon their technical merits and because the taxing jurisdictions&#8217; processes do not provide a mechanism for settling at less than the full amount of the assessment.  The Company&#8217;s consideration of these tax assessments requires judgments about the application of income tax regulations to specific facts and circumstances.  The final outcome of these matters cannot reliably be predicted
 may take many years to resolve

 in interest (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates).  In September 2019
 the Company received an interim decision on its appeal which directed the parties to work toward a settlement.  As of December 31

As part of the Codification process, the FASB issues Accounting Standards Updates to amend the Codification but otherwise the Accounting Standards Updates are not authoritative in their own right. All previous accounting standards (such as FASB Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, FASB Interpretations, FASB Staff Positions, Emerging Issues Task Force Consensuses, other pronouncements of the FASB or other designated bodies, or other forms of GAAP are considered accounting pronouncements) were superseded upon the adoption of the Codification.

Restructuring
 Settlement and Impairment Provisions












This item represents an other than temporary decline in value that has been recognized against an investment accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the investment represents the amount of the write down which is or was reflected in earnings. The written down value is a new cost basis with the adjusted value of the investment becoming its new carrying value subject to the equity accounting method. Evidence of a loss in value might include
 but would not necessarily be limited to
 absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity which would justify the carrying amount of the investment.




























Total loss recognized during the period from the impairment of goodwill plus the loss recognized in the period resulting from the impairment of the carrying amount of intangible assets
 other than goodwill.






















































































Amount of restructuring charges
 remediation cost
 and asset impairment loss.

 the second-level administrative appeal panel found in favor of ADM do Brasil and cancelled the assessments from the BFRS.  While it is unclear if the BFRS will appeal
 the Company intends to vigorously defend its position against any appeal which could be made to the administrative panel or to a superior tax chamber.&#160; The Company expects to know if the ruling will be appealed during the first half of 2020.  Based upon the view of external counsel
 it is unlikely that the BFRS will be successful in appealing the matter (see Note 13 for more information).
