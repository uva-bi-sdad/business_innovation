 as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the SEC
 requires changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. We expect these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming. For example
 in connection with being a public company
 we may have to create new board committees
 implement additional internal controls and disclose controls and procedures

Mr. Lelong may not be able to implement programs and policies in an effective and timely manner that adequately respond to such increased legal

 in the opinion of the SEC
 indemnification for liabilities arising under federal securities laws is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933

 officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered
 we will (unless in the opinion of our counsel
 the matter has been settled by controlling precedent) submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction
 the question whether indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

 the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board &#8220;FASB&#8221; Accounting Standards Codification &#8220;ASC&#8221; 605-15-05. ASC 605-15-05 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling&#160;&#160; price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.&#160; Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management&#8217;s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts.&#160; Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers
 estimated returns and allowances





 which requires the establishment of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.&#160;&#160;A valuation allowance is provided to the extent deferred tax assets may not be recoverable after consideration of the future reversal of deferred tax liabilities

 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles

 by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding plus potential dilutive securities. For the periods presented







 2009
 the Company adopted new standards for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. These standards prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. These standards also provide guidance on de-recognition
 classification
 interest and penalties
 accounting in interim periods
 disclosure




 including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions
 including state and local taxes
 the Company records allowances for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter
 for which an allowance has been established










 FASB issued ASU 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach
 classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases. The new guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2018




 2015
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16
 Business Combinations (Topic 805) (&#8220;ASU 2015-16&#8221;). Topic 805 requires that an acquirer retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination
 during the measurement period. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts
 the amendments in the Update require that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is required to also record
 in the same period&#8217;s financial statements
 the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation
 amortization
 or other income effects
 if any
 as a result of the change to the provisional amounts
 calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. In addition an entity is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning December 15















 2015
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date (&#8220;ASU 2015-14&#8221;). The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public business entities
 certain not-for-profit entities
 and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning December 15
 2017
 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31

 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting










 2016
 we did not maintain effective controls over the control environment.&#160; Specifically we have not developed and effectively communicated to our employees and consultants its accounting policies and procedures.&#160; This has resulted in inconsistent practices. Further
 the Board of Directors does not currently have any independent members and no director qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-B.&#160; Since these entity level programs have a pervasive effect across the organization












 2016
 we did not maintain effective controls over financial statement disclosure. Specifically
 controls were not designed and in place to ensure that all disclosures required were originally addressed in our financial statements.&#160;&#160;Accordingly






 management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31

 Times
 serif; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;These condensed consolidated financial instruments are measured using management&amp;#x2019;s best estimate of fair value
 where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment to estimation. Valuations based on unobservable inputs are highly subjective and require significant judgments. Changes in such judgments could have a material impact on fair value estimates. In addition
 since estimates are as of a specific point in time
 they are susceptible to material near-term changes. Changes in economic conditions may also dramatically affect the estimated fair values.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: &apos;Times New Roman&apos;
 Times
 serif; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of August 31
 2016. The respective carrying value of certain financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. These financial instruments include cash
 accounts payable and accrued expenses.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: &apos;Times New Roman&apos;

 Times
 serif; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;Derivatives are recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The conversion features of the convertible notes are embedded derivatives and are separately valued and accounted for on the consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recognized during the period of change as a separate component of other income/expense. Fair values for exchange-traded securities and derivatives are based on quoted market prices. The pricing model we use for determining fair value of our derivatives is the Lattice Model. Valuations derived from this model are subject to ongoing internal and external verification and review. The model uses market-sourced inputs such as interest rates and stock price volatilities. Selection of these inputs involves management&amp;#x2019;s judgment and may impact net income (see note 8).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: &apos;Times New Roman&apos;

 the Company has incurred recurring net losses from operations resulting in an accumulated deficit of $1
365
214 and a working capital deficit of $574
323 as of August 31
 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&amp;#x2019;s ability to continue as a going concern. Management is actively pursuing new ventures to increase revenues. In addition
 the Company is currently seeking additional sources of capital to fund short term operations. The Company
 however
 is dependent upon its ability to secure equity and/or debt financing and there are no assurances that the Company will be successful
 therefore
 without sufficient financing it would be unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern.&amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: &apos;Times New Roman&apos;

 shareholders holding 55

600 shares of the outstanding common stock of the Company
 representing approximately 71% of the Company&amp;#x2019;s outstanding shares
 acted by written consent to remove the Company&amp;#x2019;s existing members of the Board of Directors
 and in their place appoint David Lelong as the sole director of the Company. Previously
 on February 4
 2016
 shareholders representing a majority of the outstanding common stock of the Company acted by written consent to remove the Company&amp;#x2019;s directors and appoint Mr. Lelong as sole director of the Company
 and following the February 4
 2016 shareholder action
 Mr. Lelong
 acting as sole director
 replaced Mr. Gerald Ricks as President
 Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company. However
 under Nevada law
 directors may be removed only by shareholders representing two-thirds of outstanding shares; consequently the February 4
 2016 shareholder action was not valid
 and on April 25
 2016 the Company sought
 and received
 new approval from shareholders representing a sufficient percentage of outstanding shares to act validly under Nevada law.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: &apos;Times New Roman&apos;

The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company&amp;#x2019;s financial statements as reflected herein. The carrying amounts of cash
 accounts payable and accrued expenses reported on the balance sheet are estimated by management to approximate fair value primarily due to the short term nature of the instruments.

Sport Endurance
 Inc. (&#x201c;the Company&#x201d;) was incorporated as Cayenne Construction
 Inc. in the state of Nevada on January 3
 2001 (&#x201c;Inception&#x201d;). The Company was formed to be an independent service provider of ready-mix concrete
 whereby management was to arrange purchases of ready-mixed concrete by small contractors and customers on a fee basis. The Company ceased operations in 2002 and was revived in 2009 with a name change to

 Inc.&#x201d; on August 6
The audited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles and reflect all adjustments which
 in the opinion of management
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
 and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
Cash and equivalents include investments with initial maturities of three months or less.&#160;&#160;The Company maintains its cash balances at credit-worthy financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#x201c;FDIC&#x201d;) up to $250
000.&#160;&#160;Deposits with these banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits; however
 these deposits typically may be redeemed upon demand and
 therefore
 bear minimal risk. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $10
197 and $0 as of August 31
Inventory consists of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost or market by the first-in
 first-out method.&#160; The Company currently has approximately 357 containers of a performance drink currently marketed under the name &#x201c;sports leg and lung&#x201d; included in inventory at August 31
 2016.&#160; The Company had no inventory at August 31
Intangible assets generally arise from business combinations accounted for under the purchase method.&#160; The Company performs an annual review or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist
 to determine if the recorded intangible assets are impaired. During the year ended August 31
 2016 the Company recorded an impairment loss on intangible assets in the amount of $248
Equipment is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net recoverable amount
 and is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:
















Maintenance and repairs will be charged to expense as incurred. Significant renewals and betterments will be capitalized. At the time of retirement or other disposition of equipment
The Company will assess the recoverability of equipment by determining whether the depreciation and amortization of these assets over their remaining life can be recovered through projected undiscounted future cash flows. The amount of equipment impairment
 if any
The Company recognizes revenue upon product delivery. All of our products are shipped through a third party fulfillment center to the customer and the customer takes title to product and assumes risk and ownership of the product when it is delivered. Shipping charges to customers and sales taxes collectible from customers
 if any
For revenue from product sales
 the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board &#x201c;FASB&#x201d; Accounting Standards Codification &#x201c;ASC&#x201d; 605-15-05. ASC 605-15-05 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling&#160;&#160; price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.&#160; Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management&#x2019;s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts.&#160; Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers
 estimated returns and allowances
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method
 which requires the establishment of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company&#x2019;s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.&#160;&#160;A valuation allowance is provided to the extent deferred tax assets may not be recoverable after consideration of the future reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 tax planning strategies
Under FASB ASC 820-10-05
ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements defines fair value
 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles
The following provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value
Level 2- fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability
These condensed consolidated financial instruments are measured using management&#x2019;s best estimate of fair value
 where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment to estimation. Valuations based on unobservable inputs are highly subjective and require significant judgments. Changes in such judgments could have a material impact on fair value estimates. In addition
 since estimates are as of a specific point in time
Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of August 31
 2016. The respective carrying value of certain financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. These financial instruments include cash
The basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss adjusted on an &#x201c;as if converted&#x201d; basis
 by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding plus potential dilutive securities. For the periods presented
Effective January 1
 2009
 the Company adopted new standards for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. These standards prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. These standards also provide guidance on de-recognition
 classification
 interest and penalties
 accounting in interim periods
 disclosure
Various taxing authorities periodically audit the Company&#x2019;s income tax returns. These audits include questions regarding the Company&#x2019;s tax filing positions
 including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions
 including state and local taxes
 the Company records allowances for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter
 for which an allowance has been established
In February 2016
 FASB issued ASU 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach
 classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases. The new guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2018
In September
 2015
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16
 Business Combinations (Topic 805) (&#x201c;ASU 2015-16&#x201d;). Topic 805 requires that an acquirer retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination
 during the measurement period. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts
 the amendments in the Update require that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is required to also record
 in the same period&#x2019;s financial statements
 the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation
 amortization
 or other income effects
 if any
 as a result of the change to the provisional amounts
 calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. In addition an entity is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning December 15
In August
 2015
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date (&#x201c;ASU 2015-14&#x201d;). The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public business entities
 certain not-for-profit entities
 and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning December 15
 2017
 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31
 2016
There are various other updates recently issued
 most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company&#x2019;s consolidated financial position

 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]






As shown in the accompanying financial statements
 the Company has incurred recurring net losses from operations resulting in an accumulated deficit of $1
365
214 and a working capital deficit of $574
323 as of August 31
 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&#x2019;s ability to continue as a going concern. Management is actively pursuing new ventures to increase revenues. In addition
 the Company is currently seeking additional sources of capital to fund short term operations. The Company
 however
 is dependent upon its ability to secure equity and/or debt financing and there are no assurances that the Company will be successful
 therefore
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any uncertainty as to the Company&#x2019;s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements also do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts
 or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.



































The entire disclosure when substantial doubt is raised about the ability to continue as a going concern. Includes
 but is not limited to
 principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern
 management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the ability to meet its obligations
 and management's plans that alleviated or are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern.

The Company entered into convertible note agreements containing beneficial conversion features.&#160; One of the features is a ratchet reset provision which allows the note holders to reduce the conversion price should the Company issue equity with an effective price per share that is lower than the stated conversion price in the note agreement (see note 10). The Company accounts for the fair value of the conversion feature in accordance with ASC 815
 Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging and EITF 07-05
 the embedded derivatives should be bundled and valued as a single
 compound embedded derivative
The Company recognized that the conversion feature embedded within its convertible debts is a financial derivative. The Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) required that the Company&#x2019;s&#160;embedded conversion option be accounted for at fair value. The following schedule shows the change in fair value of the derivative liabilities for the period ended August 31
 2016:




































































































During the year ended August 31

On May 11
 2016 the Company entered into Securities Purchase Agreements with certain purchasers (&#x201c;the Holders&#x201d;).&#160; The Company issued 3.5% original issue discount (&#x201c;OID&#x201d;) senior secured convertible promissory notes having an aggregate face amount of $440
000 (the &#x201c;3.5% OID Convertible Notes&#x201d;).&#160; These notes bear interest at a rate of 10% per annum and mature in six months.&#160; The Company received cash proceeds of $424
600 net of the 3.5% original issue discount of $15
400.&#160; At the Holders option the principal and accrued interest under the Notes are convertible into common stock at a rate of $0.50 per share and have a full reset feature.&#160; The Notes are secured by all assets of the Company.&#160; The Company at any time may prepay in whole or in part the outstanding principal and accrued interest at 125% during the first 90 days and 130% for the period from the 91st day through maturity. During November 2016 Company entered into forbearance agreements with the investors extending its time to pay the Notes until December 16
In addition the Company issued to the Holders an aggregate of 200
000 shares of common stock value at $360
000 as commitment shares.&#160; These shares were issued during the period and are considered a discount to the Notes.&#160; Due to the reset feature of the conversion price of the convertible notes

Under FASB ASC 820-10-05
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement reaffirms that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company&#x2019;s financial statements as reflected herein. The carrying amounts of cash
Level 2 - Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets
 quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active
 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g.
 interest rates
 yield curves

The Company accounts for income taxes under FASB ASC 740-10
 which provides for an asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences
 using currently enacted tax laws
As of August 31
 2016
 the Company incurred a net operating loss and
 accordingly
 no provision for income taxes has been recorded. In addition
 no benefit for income taxes has been recorded due to the uncertainty of the realization of any tax assets.
























































































































As of August 31
 2016
 the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $578
141 available to offset future taxable income.&#160;&#160;The net operating loss carry forwards
 if not utilized
Based on the available objective evidence
 including the Company&#x2019;s history of its loss
 management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable. Accordingly
 the Company provided for a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at August 31
 2016.&#160;&#160;The Company had no uncertain tax positions as of August 31
 2016.

Accounting Policies
 by Policy (Policies)


Aug. 31
 2016






Basis of Accounting
 Policy [Policy Text Block]

The audited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles and reflect all adjustments which
 in the opinion of management
 are necessary for a fair presentation. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.



Use of Estimates
 Policy [Policy Text Block]

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
 and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.



Cash and Cash Equivalents
 Policy [Policy Text Block]

Cash and equivalents include investments with initial maturities of three months or less.&#160;&#160;The Company maintains its cash balances at credit-worthy financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#x201c;FDIC&#x201d;) up to $250
000.&#160;&#160;Deposits with these banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits; however
 these deposits typically may be redeemed upon demand and
 therefore
 bear minimal risk. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $10
197 and $0 as of August 31
 2016 and 2015.



Inventory
 Policy [Policy Text Block]

Inventory consists of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost or market by the first-in
 first-out method.&#160; The Company currently has approximately 357 containers of a performance drink currently marketed under the name &#x201c;sports leg and lung&#x201d; included in inventory at August 31
 2016.&#160; The Company had no inventory at August 31
 2015.



Intangible Assets
 Finite-Lived
 Policy [Policy Text Block]

Intangible assets generally arise from business combinations accounted for under the purchase method.&#160; The Company performs an annual review or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist
 to determine if the recorded intangible assets are impaired. During the year ended August 31
 2016 the Company recorded an impairment loss on intangible assets in the amount of $248
951.



Property
 Plant and Equipment
 Policy [Policy Text Block]

Equipment is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net recoverable amount
 and is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:
















Maintenance and repairs will be charged to expense as incurred. Significant renewals and betterments will be capitalized. At the time of retirement or other disposition of equipment
The Company will assess the recoverability of equipment by determining whether the depreciation and amortization of these assets over their remaining life can be recovered through projected undiscounted future cash flows. The amount of equipment impairment
 if any
 will be measured based on fair value and is charged to operations in the period in which such impairment is determined by management.



Revenue Recognition
 Policy [Policy Text Block]

The Company recognizes revenue upon product delivery. All of our products are shipped through a third party fulfillment center to the customer and the customer takes title to product and assumes risk and ownership of the product when it is delivered. Shipping charges to customers and sales taxes collectible from customers
 if any
For revenue from product sales
 the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board &#x201c;FASB&#x201d; Accounting Standards Codification &#x201c;ASC&#x201d; 605-15-05. ASC 605-15-05 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling&#160;&#160; price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.&#160; Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management&#x2019;s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts.&#160; Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers
 estimated returns and allowances
 and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded.&#160; The Company defers any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.



Income Tax
 Policy [Policy Text Block]

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method
 which requires the establishment of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company&#x2019;s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.&#160;&#160;A valuation allowance is provided to the extent deferred tax assets may not be recoverable after consideration of the future reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 tax planning strategies
 and projected future taxable income.



Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 Policy [Policy Text Block]

Under FASB ASC 820-10-05
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.&#160;&#160;This Statement reaffirms that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company&#x2019;s financial statements as reflected herein. The carrying amounts of cash and accrued expenses reported on the balance sheet are estimated by management to approximate fair value primarily due to the short term nature of the instruments.&#160;&#160;The Company had no items that required fair value measurement on a recurring basis.



Fair Value Measurement
 Policy [Policy Text Block]

ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements defines fair value
 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles
The following provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value
Level 2- fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability
These condensed consolidated financial instruments are measured using management&#x2019;s best estimate of fair value
 where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment to estimation. Valuations based on unobservable inputs are highly subjective and require significant judgments. Changes in such judgments could have a material impact on fair value estimates. In addition
 since estimates are as of a specific point in time
Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of August 31
 2016. The respective carrying value of certain financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. These financial instruments include cash
 accounts payable and accrued expenses



Derivatives
 Policy [Policy Text Block]





Earnings Per Share
 Policy [Policy Text Block]

The basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss adjusted on an &#x201c;as if converted&#x201d; basis
 by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding plus potential dilutive securities. For the periods presented
 there were no outstanding potential common stock equivalents and therefore basic and diluted earnings per share result in the same figure.



Income Tax Uncertainties
 Policy [Policy Text Block]

Effective January 1
 2009
 the Company adopted new standards for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. These standards prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. These standards also provide guidance on de-recognition
 classification
 interest and penalties
 accounting in interim periods
 disclosure
Various taxing authorities periodically audit the Company&#x2019;s income tax returns. These audits include questions regarding the Company&#x2019;s tax filing positions
 including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions
 including state and local taxes
 the Company records allowances for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter
 for which an allowance has been established
 is audited and fully resolved. The Company has not yet undergone an examination by any taxing authorities.



New Accounting Pronouncements
 Policy [Policy Text Block]

In February 2016
 FASB issued ASU 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach
 classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases. The new guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2018
In September
 2015
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16
 Business Combinations (Topic 805) (&#x201c;ASU 2015-16&#x201d;). Topic 805 requires that an acquirer retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination
 during the measurement period. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts
 the amendments in the Update require that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is required to also record
 in the same period&#x2019;s financial statements
 the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation
 amortization
 or other income effects
 if any
 as a result of the change to the provisional amounts
 calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. In addition an entity is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning December 15
In August
 2015
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date (&#x201c;ASU 2015-14&#x201d;). The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public business entities
 certain not-for-profit entities
 and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning December 15
 2017
 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31
 2016
