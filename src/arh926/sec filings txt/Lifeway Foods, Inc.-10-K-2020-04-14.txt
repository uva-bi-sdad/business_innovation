Product innovation and new product
development

Lifeway
is committed to maintaining its positions as the leading producer of kefir and a recognized leader in the market for probiotic
products. We routinely evaluate opportunities for new product flavors and formulations
 improved package design
 new product configurations
and other innovation opportunities. Beyond our core drinkable kefir products
 we have an ongoing effort to extend the strength
of the Lifeway brand and leverage the capabilities of the Lifeway organization into categories both inside and outside of the
dairy aisle
 including into non-food categories and into additional channels
 such as gyms and fitness studios. In 2019
 we maintained
the level of focus on product innovations
 packaging innovations
 and growth opportunities. As noted above
 these product innovation
and development efforts have led to additional revenue opportunities from Plantiful and Kefir minis. New items introduced or expanded
through our innovation efforts were offset by lower volumes of our core drinkable kefir products in 2019.


of new products to be a significant part of our overall business philosophy. Where possible
 we leverage our existing staff and
facilities to conduct our innovation
 research
 and development efforts
 rather than maintaining a dedicated research and development
staff and facilities or relying solely on third parties. In 2020
 in light of the Covid-19 outbreak
 and our focus on expanding
sales of our current products
 we don&rsquo;t expect to focus on new product development.

 independent manufacturers (&ldquo;co-packers&rdquo;) manufacture some of our products. We have co-packer
agreements to manufacture drinkable kefir in European markets our frozen kefir products
 and our probiotic supplements. During&nbsp;2019
and 2018
 approximately 1% of our revenue was derived from products manufactured by co-packers. Our co-packers are audited regularly
by our staff and are required to follow our specifications and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). Additionally
 the co-packers
are required to ensure our products are manufactured in accordance with our quality and safety specifications and that they are
compliant with all applicable laws and regulations.

 and distributors. Our sales organization strives to cultivate strong
 collaborative relationships

through third party carriers for delivery to those retailers&rsquo; distribution centers. In turn
 our retailers then deliver
the products to their respective stores. Customers in this route-to-market grouping include Kroger
 Walmart and Trader Joe&rsquo;s.
Under the retail direct model

our products to distributors that either the distributor&rsquo;s carrier picks up or Lifeway ships through third party carriers
for delivery to those distributors&rsquo; designated warehouses. In turn
 our distributors then sell and ship our products to their

 but they
also make deliveries to retailers&rsquo; distribution centers. Our distributor customers include United Natural Foods (UNFI)
 KeHE

 and C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers. The distributor attends to optimal product merchandising

our products to distributors are competitive with the prices generally paid by distributors for similar products in the markets

 we
do not offer return privileges to any of our distributors or channel customers; however
 from time to time we do provide our customers

 Lifeway&rsquo;s
kefir-based products compete with other dairy products

and service marks are important to our marketing efforts to develop brand recognition and differentiate our brand from our competitors
and are a valuable part of our business. We own many domestic and international trademarks and service marks. In addition
 we own
numerous registered and unregistered copyrights
 registered domain names
 and proprietary trade secrets
 trade dress
 technology
know-how
 processes
 and other proprietary rights that are not registered. Depending on the jurisdiction
 trademarks are generally
valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become
generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. We also have
licenses to use certain trademarks inside and outside of the United States and to certain product formulas
 all subject to the
terms of the agreements under which such licenses are granted. Lifeway&rsquo;s policy is to pursue registration of intellectual
property whenever appropriate. We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of trademark
 copyright
trade dress
 trade secret and other intellectual property laws
 and domain name dispute resolution systems; as well as licensing
agreements
 third-party confidentiality
 nondisclosure
 and assignment agreements; and by policing third-party misuses of our intellectual
property. We regard the Lifeway family of trademarks and other intellectual property as having substantial value and as being an
important factor in the marketing of our products. The loss of such protection would have a material adverse impact on our operations
and share price.

 agencies governing the manufacture

 among others
 the Federal Trade Commission (&ldquo;FTC&rdquo;)

 the United States Department of Agriculture (&ldquo;USDA&rdquo;)
 the United States Environmental

 the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&ldquo;OSHA&rdquo;)
 and their state
and local equivalents. Under various statutes
 these agencies prescribe
 among other things
 the requirements and standards for
quality
 safety
 and representation of our products to consumers. We are also subject to federal laws and regulations relating
to our products and production. For example
 as required by the National Organic Program (&ldquo;NOP&rdquo;)
 we rely on third
parties to certify certain of our products and production locations as organic. Additionally
 our facilities are subject to various
laws and regulations regarding the release of material into the environment and the protection of the environment in other ways.


 we are subject to the
laws and regulatory authorities of the foreign jurisdictions in which we manufacture and sell our products
 including the Food

and organic raw milk. Raw milk primarily contains raw skim milk
 in addition to a small percentage of butterfat and other components.
The federal government establishes minimum prices for raw milk purchased in federally regulated areas. Some states have established
their own rules for determining minimum prices. The federal government announces prices for raw milk each month. While we are subject
to federal government regulations that establish minimum prices for milk
 the prices we pay producers of organic raw milk are generally
well above such minimum prices
 as organic milk production is generally costlier
 and organic milk therefore commands a price premium.
In addition to the prices for raw milk
 we also pay producer (&ldquo;over-order&rdquo;) premiums
 federal order administration
costs
 and other related charges that vary by milk product
 location
 and supplier.





    
    





ensure the safety of our products. In addition to routine inspections by state and federal regulatory agencies
 including the USDA
and FDA
 we have instituted Company-wide quality systems that address topics such as supplier control; ingredient
 packaging
 and
product specifications; preventive maintenance; pest control; and sanitation. Each of our facilities also has in place a hazard
analysis critical control points (&ldquo;HACCP&rdquo;) plan that identifies critical pathways for contaminants and mandates control
measures that must be used to prevent
 eliminate or reduce relevant food-borne hazards. To the extent that the federal Food Safety
Modernization Act applies to Lifeway&rsquo;s business
 we develop food safety plans and implement preventive measures to protect
against food contamination. We also maintain a product recall plan
 including lot identifiability and traceability measures that
allow us to act quickly to reduce the risk of consumption of any product that we suspect may pose a health issue.

designed specifically for the food sector. The SQF Code
 based on universally accepted CODEX Alimentarius
 HACCP guidelines and
the Global Food Safety Initiative (&ldquo;GFSI&rdquo;) standards
 offers a comprehensive methodology to manage food safety and

Our product categories face a high
level of competition
 which could negatively impact our sales and results of operations.


retailer shelf space in each of our product categories. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation
 product
quality
 price
 brand recognition and loyalty
 effectiveness of marketing
 promotional activity
 and our ability to identify and
satisfy consumer tastes and preferences. We believe that our brands have benefited in many cases from being the first to introduce
products in their categories
 and their success has attracted competition from other food and beverage companies that produce branded
products
 as well as from private label competitors. Some of our competitors
 such as Danone
 General Mills
 Chobani
 Hain Celestial
Group
 and Nestle
 have substantial financial and marketing resources. These competitors and others may be able to introduce innovative
products more quickly or market their products more successfully than we can
 which could cause our growth rate to be slower than
we anticipate and could cause sales to decline.


products
 such as Millennium Products and PepsiCo
 that have lower ingredient and production-related costs. As a result
 these
competing producers may be able to offer their products to customers at a lower price point. This could cause us to lower our prices
resulting in lower profitability or
 in the alternative
 cause us to lose market share if we fail to lower prices. Furthermore
private label competitors are generally able to sell their products at lower prices because private label products typically have
lower marketing costs than their branded counterparts. If our products fail to compete successfully with other branded or private
label offerings
 demand for our products and our sales volumes could be negatively impacted.


 due to high levels of competition
certain of our key retailers may demand price concessions on our products or may become more resistant to price increases for our
products. Increased price competition and resistance to price increases have had
 and may continue to have
 a negative effect on
our results of operations.

 we may be
required to recall or withdraw products

 customers may cancel orders for such products as a result of such events. Even if
a situation does not necessitate a recall or market withdrawal
 and even if we and each of our co-packers and suppliers comply
in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations
 we may become subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such
matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued
 the negative publicity surrounding any assertion
that our products caused illness or physical harm
 including the risk of reputational harm being magnified and/or distorted through
the rapid dissemination of information over the Internet

The loss of any independent certifications could adversely affect our market position as a probiotic-based products and natural

 which could harm our business. We rely on independent SQF certification at some of
our facilities
 a certification that some of our customers require us to maintain.


independent organizations or certification authorities in order to label our products as certified. For example
 we can lose our
&ldquo;organic&rdquo; certification if a manufacturing plant becomes contaminated with non-organic materials
 or if it is not properly
cleaned after a production run. In addition
 all organic raw materials must be certified organic. Our products could lose their
organic certifications if our raw material suppliers lose their organic certifications. Similarly
 we could lose our SQF certification
if we do not meet the requirements of the SQF Code. The loss of these certifications could cause us to lose customers that require
Lifeway products and/or facilities to carry some or all of them
 which could negatively affect our sales and results of operations.





    
    


Increases in the cost of raw milk
could reduce our gross margin and profit.


 our
primary raw material
 is an agricultural commodity that is subject to price fluctuations. Although both conventional and organic
milk prices in fiscal 2019 were relatively consistent with the prior year
 there can be no assurance that such prices will remain
at these levels in the future. The supply and price of raw milk may be impacted by
 among other things
 weather
 natural disasters
real or perceived supply shortages
 lower dairy and crop yields
 general increases in farm inputs and costs of production
 political
and economic conditions
 labor actions
 government actions
 and trade barriers. Increases in the market price for raw milk or over-order
premiums charged by producers may also impact our ability to enter into purchase commitments at a fixed price. There can be no
assurance that our purchasing practices will mitigate future price risk. As a result
 increases in the cost of raw milk could have
an adverse impact on our profitability.


 the dairy industry continues
to experience periodic imbalances between supply and demand for organic raw milk. Industry regulation and the costs of organic
farming compared to costs of conventional farming can impact the supply of organic raw milk in the market. Oversupply levels of
organic raw milk can increase competitive pressure on our products and pricing
 while supply shortages can cause higher input costs
and reduce our ability to deliver product to our customers. Cost increases in raw materials and other inputs could cause our profits
to decrease significantly compared to prior periods
 as we may be unable to increase our prices to offset the increased cost of
these raw materials and other inputs. If we are unable to obtain raw materials and other inputs for our products or offset any
increased costs for such raw materials and inputs
 our business could be negatively affected.

Reduced availability of raw materials
and other inputs
 as well as increased costs for them
 could adversely affect us.

 such as sweeteners
 diesel fuel
 packaging material
 resin
and other commodities. Our raw materials are generally sourced from third-party suppliers
 and we are not assured of continued
supply
 pricing
 or exclusive access to raw materials from any of these suppliers. In addition
 some of our raw materials are also
agricultural products
 and therefore subject to the same vulnerabilities described above for raw milk. Other events that adversely
affect our third-party suppliers and that are out of our control could also impair our ability to obtain the raw materials and
other inputs that we need in the quantities and at the prices that we desire. Such events include problems with our suppliers&rsquo;

 finances
 labor relations
 costs
 production
 insurance
 and reputation.

with other manufacturers in the procurement of organic product ingredients may increase in the future if consumer demand for organic
products increases.

Interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability

suppliers and co-packers that require them to provide us with specific finished goods
 including packaging
 kefir
 and probiotic

 we essentially rely on a single supplier or co-packer as our sole source for the item.
The failure for any reason of any such sole source or other co-packer to fulfill its obligations under the applicable agreements
with us or the termination or renegotiation of any such sourcing agreement could result in disruptions to our supply of finished
goods and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally
 our suppliers and co-packers are subject to risk
including labor disputes
 union organizing activities
 financial liquidity
 inclement weather
 natural disasters
 supply constraints
and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable products
 which
could disrupt our supply of finished goods
 or require that we incur additional expense by providing financial accommodations to
the supplier or co-packer or taking other steps to seek to minimize or avoid supply disruption
 such as establishing new arrangements
with other providers. A new arrangement may not be available on terms as favorable to us as our existing arrangements

from time to time
 we may need additional financing to support our business and pursue our business strategy
 including strategic
acquisitions. Our ability to obtain additional financing
 if and when required
 will depend on investor demand
 our operating performance
the condition of the capital markets
 and other factors. We cannot assure that additional financing will be available to us on
favorable terms when required
 or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity

The outcome of litigation is often difficult to predict
 and the outcome of pending or future claims and legal proceedings may
have a material adverse effect on our financial position

proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate
 if possible
 the amount of potential losses. Based
on these assessments and estimates
 we establish reserves or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings

positions taken by the NOP pursuant to the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990
 which created the NOP
 are subject to continued
review and scrutiny.


the introduction of new laws or regulations could increase our compliance costs

 we could be subject to civil remedies
 including
third-party claims for property damage or personal injury
 fines
 injunctions

the election of all of our directors and the approval or rejection of any merger

transaction. No person interested in acquiring Lifeway will be able to do so without obtaining the consent of the Smolyansky family.
We believe that having the Smolyansky family as a significant part of a long-term-focused

 and engaged stockholder base
provides us with an important strategic advantage
 particularly in a business with a mature
 well-recognized brand. This advantage

 to be controlling stockholders of Lifeway.
We desire to remain independent and family-owned
 and we believe the Smolyansky family shares these interests. However
 the Smolyansky

committee
 and a fully independent compensation committee. Our Board of Directors has determined that Lifeway will avail itself
of these exemptions
 though we currently maintain a Board composed of a majority of independent directors. In reliance on the controlled
company exemptions described above
 we have chosen to combine our audit

redundancies in our independent committee structure given the size of our Board. The Committee fulfills the Board&rsquo;s delegated

 and we are unable to predict the nature and timing
of when that impact may occur
 if at all. Restrictions on public gatherings or interactions may also limit the opportunity for
our customers and consumers to purchase our products. If a significant percentage of our workforce or the workforce of our suppliers
is unable to work
 including because of illness or travel or government restrictions in connection with pandemics or disease outbreaks
our operations may be negatively impacted. In addition
 pandemics or disease outbreaks could result in a widespread health crisis
that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets
 consumer spending and confidence levels resulting in an economic
downturn that could affect customers&rsquo; demand for our products. The recent outbreak of the coronavirus has recently become
a pandemic
 and neither the duration nor scope of the disruption can be predicted. Therefore
 the financial impact cannot be reasonably
estimated at this time.

662 for the year ended
December 31
 2019
 a decrease of $9
688 or 9.4% versus prior year. The net sales softness continued to reflect the overall lower
consumption in the dairy and cultured dairy product categories. Versus prior year
 the decline was primarily driven by lower volumes
of our branded drinkable kefir and cupped kefir and Skyr sales
 partially offset by the incremental volume of new item introductions.




decreased to 23.6% during the year ended December 31
 2019 from 25.0% during the same period in 2018. The lower gross profit percentage
primarily reflects category sales softness
 the unfavorable impact of operating leverage that arises from lower net sales relative
to fixed costs
 and increased freight costs and depreciation
 partially offset by a reduction in variable costs.




415 or
17.9% to $11
062 during the year ended December 31
 2019 from $13
477 during the same period in 2018. The decreased selling expenses
primarily reflect the reduction in advertising and marketing programs with lower efficiency and compensation savings from organizational
changes made in 2018. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.8% during the year ended December 31
 2019 compared
to 13.0% for the same period in 2018.




$788 or 5.8% to $12
828 during the year ended December 31
 2019 from $13
616 during the same period in 2018. The decrease is primarily
a result of lower compensation expense due to organizational changes made in 2018
 and lower professional fees
 partially offset
by increased legal expenses.

federal
 state and local income taxes. Income tax expense was $782 during the year ended December 31
 2019
 compared to a benefit
for income taxes of $225 during the same period in 2018.



the year ended December 31
 2019 was 63.3% compared to an ETR of 6.8% in the same period last year. The increase in the effective
tax rate was primarily due to the separate state tax rates
 non-deductible officer compensation expense
 non-deductible compensation
expense related to equity incentive awards
 and the provision for unrecognized tax benefits. The increase in the effective tax
rate from 2018 to 2019 is due to the fact that the company has a number of items that are nondeductible or are discrete adjustments
to tax expense. Although similar items were reflected in 2018
 the percentage effect is substantially different due to the difference
in pre-tax income in 2019 compared to the pre-tax loss in 2018.





    
    



of compensation paid to certain of our executives. Under the Act&rsquo;s amendments to Section 162(m)
 no tax deduction in taxable
years beginning after December 31
 2017 is allowed for compensation paid to any covered employee to the extent that the total compensation
for that covered employee exceeds $1
000
000 in any taxable year. Although the Act eliminated the prior tax deduction under Section
162(m) for performance-based executive compensation
 it included a transition rule under which the changes to Section 162(m) will
not apply to awards made to our covered employees who had the right to participate in our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan pursuant
to written binding contracts in effect as of November 2
 2017
 as long as those contracts have not subsequently been modified in
any material respect. Accordingly
 subject to further guidance from the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (&ldquo;IRS&rdquo;)
the performance-based compensation paid to our executives under our Omnibus Plan remained eligible for the Section 162(m) exemption
in 2019.

outbreak will have on our consolidated results of operations is uncertain. Lifeway has seen increased orders from retail customers
in North America and Europe in March 2020 in response to increased consumer demand for food at home in response to government mandated
social distancing and shelter in place orders in the United States and the immune boosting quality of our products. However near-term
elevated retail customer orders may decrease in the coming months
 and we are unable to predict the nature and timing of when that
impact may occur
 if at all. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic

Neither the duration nor scope of any disruption can be predicted. Therefore
 the financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated
at this time.


 our manufacturing facilities
have not been significantly impacted. We have full production capacity available at all locations at this time. On March 16
 2020
the food industry
 including grocery stores and their suppliers
 and transportation were classified by the U.S. federal government
as critical infrastructure industry. As a result
 our employees and facilities
 as well as the retailers and distributors that
sell our products
 will be able to remain in operation. During the first quarter of 2020
 Management
 anticipating the spread of
Covid-19 and its effects
 implemented a plan to mitigate effects of Covid-19 on supply and transportation of materials used to
make and package our products

 and transportation of our products to customers. While the situation is fluid
 we have

cash equivalents of $838 during the year ended December 31
 2019 compared to a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $1

in the same period in 2018. The drivers of the year over year change are as follows:


was $3
811 during the year ended December 31
 2019 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $2
417 in the same
period in 2018. The increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to the change in working capital and income
tax refunds received in 2019.


$838 during the year ended December 31
 2019 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $2
720 in the same period in
2018. The lower level of net cash used in investing activities in 2019 reflects lower capital spending. Capital spending was $1
178
during the year ended December 2019 compared to $2
824 in 2018. Our capital spending is focused in three core areas: growth
 cost
reduction
 and facility improvements. Growth capital spending supports new product innovation and enhancements. Cost reduction
spending supports manufacturing efficiency
 safety and productivity. We received net proceeds of $474 related to the sale of our
Skokie
 IL facility during Q3 2019. During Q4 2019
 the Company tendered approximately 45.6% of one of its investments recorded
under the cost method on the consolidated balance sheets for cash proceeds of $1
509. See financing section below for use of those
proceeds.


$3
811 during the year ended December 31
 2019 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $1
677 in the same period in
2018. Under the terms of its line of credit agreement (see Note 7)
 we utilized proceeds from our federal and state income tax
refunds to repay $1
330 on our revolving line of credit during the first quarter of 2019. We utilized the proceeds from the sale
of our Skokie
 IL facility to repay $459 on our revolving line of credit during the third quarter of 2019. We utilized proceeds
from the sale of our investment described in the investing section above to make a mandatory prepayment of $1
484 on our revolving
line of credit during the fourth quarter of 2019. On November 1
 2017
 Lifeway&rsquo;s Board approved an increase in the aggregate
amount under our previously announced 2015 stock repurchase program (the &ldquo;2017 Repurchase Plan Amendment&rdquo;)
 by adding
to (i.e.
 exclusive of the shares previously authorized under the 2015 stock repurchase program) the authorization the lesser of
$5
185 or 625 shares. We repurchased approximately 211 shares of common stock at a cost of $538 during the year ended December
31
 2019 under the 2017 Repurchase Plan Amendment. We repurchased approximately 218 shares of common stock at a cost of $1
379
during the year ended December 31
 2018 under the 2017 Repurchase Plan Amendment. We may execute transactions from time to time
in the open market or by private negotiation
 in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations. We intend to hold
repurchased shares in treasury for general corporate purposes
 including issuances under our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Treasury
shares are accounted for using the cost method.




 2019
 effective March 31
2019
 Lifeway entered into the First Modification to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the &ldquo;Modified
Revolving Credit Facility&rdquo;) with its existing lender. Under the amendment
 the Modified Revolving Credit Facility provides
for a revolving line of credit up to a maximum of $9 million (the &ldquo;Revolving Loan&rdquo;) with an incremental facility not
to exceed $5 million (the &ldquo;Incremental Facility&rdquo; and together with the Revolving Loan
 the &ldquo;Loans&rdquo;).


 2019
 Lifeway entered into
the Second Modification to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement
 as amended
 (the &ldquo;Second Modification&rdquo;)
with its existing lender. The Second Modification amends the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement
 as amended
 by redefining
the &ldquo;Borrowing Base&rdquo; and further clarifying the definitions of &ldquo;Eligible Accounts&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eligible
Inventory.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Borrowing Base&rdquo; under this amendment means
 generally
 an amount equal to the sum of (a) 85%
of the unpaid amount of all eligible accounts receivable
 plus (b) 50% of the value of all eligible inventory. The Second Modification
also addresses the calculation of interest after the potential discontinuance of LIBOR and its replacement with a replacement benchmark
interest rate.

Credit Facility also provides for events of default
 including failure to repay principal and interest when due and failure to
perform or violation of the provisions or covenants of the agreement
 as a result of which amounts due under the Modified Revolving
Credit Facility may be accelerated. We were in compliance with the applicable covenants as of December 31
 2019.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Use of Estimates


as those most important to the portrayal of a company&rsquo;s financial condition and results
 and require the most difficult
subjective
 or complex judgments. In many cases
 the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated
by US GAAP with no need for the application of our judgement. In certain circumstances
 the preparation of our Consolidated Financial
Statements in conformity with US GAAP requires us to use our judgment to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated
Financial Statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. We believe in the quality
and reasonableness of our critical accounting estimates; however
 materially different amounts might be reported under different
conditions or using assumptions
 estimates or making judgments different from those that we have applied. Management has discussed
the development and selection of these critical accounting policies
 as well as our significant accounting policies (see Note 2
to the Consolidated Financial Statements)
 with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We have identified the policies
described below as our critical accounting policies.




124 as of December
31
 2019. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis as of December 31
 2019. Our assessment did not result
in an impairment. The fair value exceeded the carrying value by 2.4%. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair
value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets acquired. We estimate the fair value of our one reporting unit
annually (as of December 31)
 or more frequently if certain conditions exist
 using a combination of the fair values derived from
both the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach
 we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based
on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on our estimates of revenue growth rates and
operating margins
 taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The discount rate used to determine the present value
of future cash flows is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific
characteristics and the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. The market approach
estimates fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar
operating and investment characteristics. The resulting fair value
 based on the income and market approaches
 is then compared
to the carrying value to determine if impairment is necessary.





    
    



impairment analysis as of December 31
 2018
 which indicated the carrying value of our reporting unit exceeded its fair value by
$1
244. Accordingly
 we recorded a $1
244 non-cash impairment charge in 2018. The goodwill impairment loss is included in Goodwill
and intangible asset impairment on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.


assets
 which consist of brand names totaling $3
700 as of December 31
 2019
 using the relief from royalty method. Significant
assumptions include the royalty rate
 revenue growth rates
 and discount rates. Our assumptions were based on historical performance
and management estimates of future performance. Our assessment did not result in an impairment in 2019 and 2018.




incentive programs to customers and consumers. From time to time
 we grant certain sales discounts to customers which are classified
as a reduction in sales. The measurement and recognition of discounts and allowances involve the use of judgment and our estimates
are made based on historical experience and specific customer program accruals. Differences between estimated and actual discount
and allowance costs are normally not material and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. The
process for analyzing trade promotion programs could impact our results of operations and trade spending accruals depending on
how actual results of the programs compare to original estimates. As of December 31
 2019
 we had $.7 million of accrued discounts
and allowances.




receive various forms of share-based payment awards and we recognize compensation expense for these awards based on their grant
date fair values. The fair values of stock option awards are estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model
 which incorporates certain assumptions regarding the expected term of an award and expected stock price volatility. The
expected term is determined under the simplified method
 using an average of the contractual term and vesting period of the stock
options. The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility of our common stock. We do not estimate forfeitures in measuring
the grant date fair value
 but rather account for forfeitures as they occur. Key assumptions are described in further detail in
Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.




regulations
 and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. At any one time
 multiple tax years are subject to
audit by the various taxing authorities. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting
using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.


an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The income tax benefit recognized in our financial statements from such
a position is measured based on the largest estimated benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. These judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and changes to
or further interpretations of
 regulations. If such changes take place
 there is a risk that our tax rate may increase or decrease
in any period
 which would impact our earnings. Future business results may affect deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of
deferred tax assets over time.&nbsp;

for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
 and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting
 included in the accompanying Management&rsquo;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.


the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
 assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists
 and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal
Control over Financial Reporting


financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. A company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
 or disposition of the company&rsquo;s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


 internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (&ldquo;U.S. GAAP&rdquo;). Our consolidated financial statements include all of the assets
 liabilities and results
of operations of Lifeway&rsquo;s wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively &ldquo;Lifeway&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;). All
inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

Note 2 &ndash; Summary of significant
accounting policies 




statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant
estimates made in preparing the consolidated financial statements include the reserve for promotional allowances
 the valuation
of goodwill and intangible assets
 stock-based and incentive compensation
 and deferred income taxes.




Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) 205-40

to assess an entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related disclosure in certain circumstances.
There were no conditions or events

 that raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued.

to our customers or their common carriers. The Company adopted this standard at the beginning of fiscal year 2018
 with no significant
impact to its financial position or results of operations

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets


price over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets acquired. We estimate the fair value of
our one reporting unit annually (as of December 31)
 or more frequently if certain conditions exist
 using a combination of the
fair values derived from both the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach
 we calculate the fair value
of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on our estimates
of revenue growth rates and operating margins
 taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The discount rate used
to determine the present value of future cash flows is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant
risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the
projected cash flows. The market approach estimates fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable
publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics. The resulting fair value
 based on the income
and market approaches
 is then compared to the carrying value to determine if impairment is necessary. In the fourth quarter of
2018
 we early adopted ASU 2017-04
 Intangibles &mdash; Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment
which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test.


asset impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently
if certain conditions exist. The qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate
it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If
 based
on this qualitative assessment
 we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset
is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment
 a quantitative assessment is performed
to determine whether an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment exists. We test the indefinite-lived intangible assets for
impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair value based on current revenue projections of the related operations
 under
the relief from royalty method. Any excess of the carrying value over the amount of fair value is recognized as an impairment.
Any such impairment would be recognized in full in the reporting period in which it has been identified.




combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Identifiable intangible assets with finite
lives are amortized over their estimate useful lives as follows:



    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    



in Amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.


for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Lifeway conducts
more frequent impairment assessments if certain conditions exist
 such as a change in the competitive landscape
 any internal decisions
to pursue new or different strategies
 a loss of a significant customer
 or a significant change in the market place including
changes in the prices paid for our products or changes in the size of the market for our products. If an evaluation of the undiscounted
cash flows indicates impairment
 the asset is written down to its estimated fair value
 which is generally based on discounted
future cash flows. If the estimated remaining useful life of an intangible asset is changed
 the remaining carrying amount of the
intangible asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life.

the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:

Quoted prices

Observable

 quoted prices for identical or similar
assets or liabilities in inactive markets

for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Inputs that are
generally unobservable and typically reflect management&rsquo;s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing
the asset or liability.

 as well as all open tax years in these
jurisdictions. We recognize the income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that
 based on
technical merits
 the position will be sustained upon examination
 including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes.
We apply a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly
 we recognize
the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in
judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the period of such change.
For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained
 no tax benefit has been
recognized in the financial statements. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits can change due to audit settlements
 tax
examination activities
 statute expirations and the recognition and measurement criteria under accounting for uncertainty in income
taxes. Lifeway recognizes penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision (benefit) for income taxes

 the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update (&ldquo;ASU&rdquo;) No. 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842)
 which affects any entity that enters into a lease (as that
term is defined in ASU 2016-02)
 with some specified scope exceptions. Under ASU 2016-02
 companies can adopt the amended guidance
using a modified retrospective transition approach
 using an application date of either the beginning of the earliest comparative
period presented or the beginning of the reporting period in which the companies first apply the new standard. We adopted this
standard on January 1
 2019 using the application date of January 1
 2019
 and elected certain practical expedients allowed under
the standard. In July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11
 Leases (842)
 Targeted Improvements
 which provides an additional
transition election to not restate comparative periods for the effects of applying the new standard. The guidance requires lessees
to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements
such as information about variable lease payments and options to renew and terminate leases. The amended guidance will require
both operating and finance leases to be recognized in the balance sheet. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial
position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying
asset for the lease term.


expedients that are permitted under the transition guidance within ASU 2016-02 and related standards. Among other things
 this
practical expedient allowed us to carryforward the historical lease classification
 and not reassess initial direct costs for any
existing leases as of January 1
 2019 or reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases. In addition
we elected to adopt the hindsight practical expedient to determine the reasonably certain lease term for existing leases. We made
an accounting policy election to continue recording leases with an initial term of 12 months or less consistent with our prior
financial reporting and elect the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components. We have revised our relevant policies
and procedures
 as applicable
 to meet the new accounting
 reporting and disclosure requirements of Topic 842 and have updated
internal controls accordingly.





    
    



in ASU 2016-02 and prior GAAP is the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified
as operating leases under current GAAP. Recognition of the right-of-use assets and liabilities had a material impact to our consolidated
balance sheet upon adoption. However
 since all our leases are operating leases under ASC 840 and we will carryforward the historical
lease classification
 the new standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Operations
 Consolidated
Statements of Stockholders&rsquo; Equity
 or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31
 2019. The adoption
resulted in an increase of the right-of-use assets of approximately $944 and lease liabilities of $997
 and an adjustment to beginning
retained earnings of $53 as of January 1
 2019.




 the FASB issued ASU No.
2020-04
 Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The new
guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to contracts
hedging relationships
 and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because
of reference rate reform. The guidance will be effective prospectively as of March 12
 2020 through December 31
 2022 and interim
periods within those fiscal years. Management is currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on the consolidated
financial statements.


 the FASB issued ASU No.
2019-12
 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The new guidance is intended to enhance and simplify

to the general approach to the income tax accounting model
 and adds new guidance to reduce the complexity in accounting for income

 2020 and interim periods within those
fiscal years. Early adoption of the amendments is permitted
 including adoption in any interim period for public business entities
for periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. Management is currently evaluating the impact that the new
guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.

 Financial Instruments&mdash;Credit
Losses. The series of new guidance amends the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forward-looking approach based on
expected losses rather than incurred losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments
 including trade
receivables. This may result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. The guidance should be applied on either a prospective
transition or modified-retrospective approach depending on the subtopic. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning
after December 15
 2022
 including interim periods within those fiscal years
 with early adoption permitted. Management is currently
evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.

assessment of goodwill for our single reporting unit as of December 31
 2019
 noting no impairment loss. The fair value exceeded
the carrying value by 2.4%. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate goodwill for impairment. We estimate fair
value using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiples analysis with respect to
our single reporting unit. These valuation approaches are dependent upon a number of factors
 including estimates of future growth
rates
 our cost of capital
 capital expenditures
 income tax rates
 and other variables. Assumptions used in our valuations were
consistent with our internal projections and operating plans. Our discounted cash flows forecast could be negatively impacted by
a change in the competitive landscape
 any internal decisions to pursue new or different strategies
 a loss of a significant customer
or a significant change in the market place including changes in the prices paid for our products or changes in the size of the
market for our products. Additionally
 under the market approach analysis
 we used significant other observable inputs including
various guideline company comparisons. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable
 but which are
unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates or assumptions could materially affect the determination of
fair value and the conclusions of the quantitative goodwill test for our one reporting unit.

by substantially all of Lifeway&rsquo;s assets. See Line of Credit below.




 2018
 Lifeway entered into an
Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the &ldquo;Revolving Credit Facility&rdquo;) with its existing lender. The Revolving
Credit Facility provides for a revolving line of credit up to a maximum of $10 million (the &ldquo;Revolving Loan&rdquo;) with
an incremental facility not to exceed $5 million (the &ldquo;Incremental Facility&rdquo; and together with the Revolving Loan
the &ldquo;Loans&rdquo;). The proceeds of the Loans were used to pay off Lifeway&rsquo;s existing debt with the lender under the
Loan and Security Agreement
 Revolving Note
 and Term Note entered into on February 6
 2009
 and for general working capital purposes.
Upon closing
 we retired all the then-outstanding term loans described above.


 2019
 we had $2

or the Prime Rate) or the LIBOR plus 2.50%
 payable monthly in arrears. Lifeway is also required to pay a quarterly unused line
fee and
 in conjunction with the issuance of any letters of credit
 a letter of credit fee.


Facility matures May 7
 2021. The Revolving Credit Facility is presented as a long-term debt obligation as of December 31
 2019.
The Loans and all other amounts due and owed under the Revolving Credit Facility and related documents are secured by substantially
all of our assets.


Revolving Credit Facility equal the lesser of (i) the Borrowing Base (as defined below)
 or (ii) $10 million (plus the amount of
any Incremental Facility requested by Lifeway and approved by lender)
 in each case
 as the same is reduced by the aggregate principal
amount outstanding under the Loans. &ldquo;Borrowing Base&rdquo; under the Revolving Credit Facility means
 generally
 an amount
equal to our cash and cash equivalents plus our eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory
 less certain reserves
 divided
by 1.5.


customary representations
 warranties
 and covenants on the part of Lifeway
 including financial covenants requiring us to achieve
a minimum EBITDA threshold for each of the fiscal quarters through December 31
 2018; maintain (a) a fixed charge coverage ratio
of no less than 1.25 to 1.0
 and (b) a Senior Debt to EBITDA ratio of not more than 3.00 to 1.0 at December 31
 2018 and for each
of the succeeding fiscal quarters ending through the expiration date. The Revolving Credit Facility also provides for events of
default
 including failure to repay principal and interest when due and failure to perform or violation of the provisions or covenants
of the agreement
 as a result of which amounts due under the Revolving Credit Facility may be accelerated.


 2019
 effective March 31
2019
 Lifeway entered into the First Modification to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the &ldquo;Modified
Revolving Credit Facility&rdquo;) with its existing lender. Under the amendment
 the Modified Revolving Credit Facility provides
for a revolving line of credit up to a maximum of $9 million (the &ldquo;Revolving Loan&rdquo;) with an incremental facility not
to exceed $5 million (the &ldquo;Incremental Facility&rdquo; and together with the Revolving Loan
 the &ldquo;Loans&rdquo;).





    
    



 2019
 Lifeway entered into
the Second Modification to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement
 as amended
 (the &ldquo;Second Modification&rdquo;)
with its existing lender. The Second Modification amends the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement
 as amended
 by redefining
the &ldquo;Borrowing Base&rdquo; and further clarifying the definitions of &ldquo;Eligible Accounts&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eligible
Inventory.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Borrowing Base&rdquo; under this amendment means
 generally
 an amount equal to the sum of (a) 85%
of the unpaid amount of all eligible accounts receivable
 plus (b) 50% of the value of all eligible inventory. The Second Modification
also addresses the calculation of interest after the potential discontinuance of LIBOR and its replacement with a replacement benchmark
interest rate.

 in conjunction with the issuance
of any letters of credit
 a letter of credit fee. Lifeway&rsquo;s interest rate on debt outstanding under our Revolving Credit
Facility as of December 31
 2019 was 4.36%.

date. We have elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components into a single component for all of its
leases. For many of our leases such as real estate leases
 we are unable to determine an implicit rate; therefore
 we use our incremental
borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments
for those leases. We include options to extend or terminate the lease in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability
when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term.

evaluate
 on a periodic basis

would make a loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. If a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable
we do not establish an accrued liability. Currently

legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business

 Lifeway stockholders
approved the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan
 which authorized the issuance of an aggregate of 3.5 million shares to satisfy awards
of stock options
 stock appreciation rights
 unrestricted stock
 restricted stock
 restricted stock units
 performance shares
and performance units to qualifying employees. Under the Plan
 the Board or its Audit and Corporate Governance Committee approves
stock awards to executive officers and certain senior executives
 generally in the form of restricted stock or performance shares.
The number of performance shares that participants may earn depends on the extent to which the corresponding performance goals
have been achieved. Stock awards generally vest over a three-year performance or service period. At December 31
 2019
 3.377 million
shares remain available under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. While we plan to continue to issue awards pursuant to the Plan at least
annually
 we may choose to suspend the issuance of new awards in the future and may grant additional awards at any time including
issuing special grants of restricted stock
 restricted stock units
 and stock options to attract and retain new and

 2015
 Lifeway&rsquo;s
Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program (the &ldquo;2015 stock repurchase program&rdquo;) under which we may
from time to time
 repurchase shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed the lesser of $3
500 or
250 shares. On November 1
 2017
 the Board amended the 2015 stock repurchase program (the &ldquo;2017 amendment&rdquo;)
 by adding
to (i.e.
 exclusive of the shares previously authorized under the 2015 stock repurchase program) the authorization the lesser of
$5
185 or 625 shares. Under the amended authorization
 share repurchases may be executed through various means
 including without
limitation in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions
 in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations
including without limitation Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended. The extent to which Lifeway repurchases
its shares and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon a variety of factors
 including market conditions
 regulatory requirements
and other corporate considerations. The repurchase program does not obligate us to purchase any shares
 and the program may be
terminated
 suspended
 increased
 or decreased by our Board in its discretion at any time.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures


that are designed to ensure material information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized
 and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&rsquo;s rules and forms
 and
that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our principal executive officer
 principal financial
officer and principal accounting officer
 as appropriate
 to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure. In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures
 we recognize that a control system
 no matter how well designed
and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of
the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud
 if any
 within a company have been detected.


 2019 (the &ldquo;Evaluation
Date&rdquo;)
 we conducted an evaluation
 under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer
 of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;)). Based on this evaluation
 our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer have concluded that
 as of the Evaluation Date
 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31
 2019 in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us under the
Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized
 and reported within the time periods specified under the Exchange Act rules.

Management&rsquo;s Annual Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting


and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is identified in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f).
Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by
 or under the supervision of
 our principal executive officer
principal financial officer and principal accounting officer
 and effected by the Board of Directors
 management
 and other personnel
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:



    
    
pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets;




    
    
provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our consolidated&nbsp;financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
 and that our receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors; and




    
    
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
 or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated&nbsp;financial statements.



has inherent limitations which may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the level
of compliance with related policies or procedures may deteriorate.


 including our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
 assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December
31
 2019. In making this assessment
 management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (&ldquo;COSO&rdquo;) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment
 management
has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31
 2019.




 management evaluated our policies
and procedures related to the review of the analysis in goodwill impairment reports prepared by third-party valuation experts and
designed and implemented adequate internal controls and procedures to ensure that (i) goodwill impairment is properly reviewed
accounted for and disclosed
 and (ii) management can more effectively evaluate analysis conducted by third-party valuation service
providers that perform the step one goodwill impairment analysis.

Lifeway
Foods
 Inc. Increases Production to Support Accelerated Demand and Local Communities during COVID-19 Health Crisis

Expects
First Quarter 2020 Preliminary
 Unaudited Net Sales to Increase 2% to 4% from 1Q19 with the Month of March Net Sales Up Over 13%
Year-over-Year

Delivers
Second Consecutive Sequential Quarter of Sales Improvement with Strong Industry Tailwinds



April 14

 Inc. (Nasdaq: LWAY) (&ldquo;Lifeway&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Company&rdquo;)
 the leading
U.S. supplier of kefir and fermented probiotic products to support the microbiome
 today provided a business update in conjunction
with reporting its fourth quarter and full year results for the period ended December 31
 2019 which was filed today with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Lifeway also announced that it expects preliminary
 unaudited first quarter 2020 net sales to increase
2% to 4% as compared to the first quarter of 2019 with the month of March net sales up 13% year-over-year.


start to 2020. Our team&rsquo;s execution of our long-term strategic plan
 Lifeway 2.0
 is demonstrated by the sequential improvement
in our sales trends in the fourth quarter resulting in our ability to reinvigorate growth which has accelerated into the first
quarter of 2020 with net sales expected to be up 2% to 4% year-over-year including a really strong March monthly sales&rdquo; commented
Julie Smolyansky
 Lifeway&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer. &ldquo;Our current focus is the health
 safety and wellbeing of our
employees
 as well as local and national communities during this time of unprecedented uncertainty and crisis related to COVID-19.
At Lifeway
 we are committed to supporting the accelerated demand for retail sales and community aid donations through an increase
in our kefir production
 and we are instituting the Lifeway Heroes Commitment Award
 an hourly bonus for employees in our production
and warehouse facilities in recognition of their incredible work. In addition
 Lifeway is providing donations to Singer and songwriter
Jewel&rsquo;s Inspiring Children
 Mount Sinai Hospital
 Meals on Wheels Chicago
 Food Bank for New York City and other local and
national food pantries to help ensure first responders and those in need have access to microbiome-supporting products and are
able to nourish themselves and their families. To date
 Lifeway has donated over 45
000 servings of kefir
 and we plan to continue
providing additional product for as long as needed.&rdquo;


 &ldquo;During this time of shelter-in-place
as a result of COVID-19
 40% of Americans are more proactively taking care of their physical and emotional health and 17% are consuming
more immunity and overall self-care supporting products such as probiotics and vitamins
 according to IRI. In the first quarter
of 2020
 we have increased our production to meet accelerated demand at both grocery retail and online grocery as more consumers
focus on self-care and nutrition to aid in their overall health and wellness needs. Kefir has emerged as a top 2020 consumer choice
for gut health and it continues to rise with people becoming increasingly educated on the importance of a healthy
 functioning
gut and how it can determine consumers overall well-being. Based on a 2017 study from The Nutrition Society the health benefits
of fermented milk drinks such as kefir included improved digestion
 anti-inflammatory effects and the stimulation of antioxidants
which can aid disease prevention. We believe Lifeway is well positioned for long-term growth and value creation with strong industry
tailwinds to fuel our business as we increasingly serve consumers looking for more self-care
 immunity and gut health options during
this time of global health crisis and uncertainty.&rdquo;


tailwinds including lower dairy and oil prices as well as the following highlights:




Dairy is up 11% on a dollar basis for the Total U.S. MULO for the year-to-date 2020 period ended March 22
 2020

2020
 during which coronavirus concerns in the U.S. began to scale
 sales growth for overall dietary supplements skyrocketed to

 Segments
 Products and Customers).&#13;We also sell bulk cream
 a byproduct of our fluid milk manufacturing process. In accordance with ASC 606
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 we recognize revenue when control over the products transfers to&#13;our customers
 which generally occurs upon delivery to our customers or their common carriers. The Company adopted this standard&#13;at the beginning of fiscal year 2018
 with no significant impact to its financial position or results of operations
 using the&#13;modified retrospective method. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled&#13;to receive in exchange for these goods or services

 the contract is the approved&#13;sales order
 which may also be supplemented by other agreements that formalize various terms and conditions with customers. The&#13;Company applies judgment in determining the customer&amp;#8217;s ability and intention to pay
 which is based on a variety of factors&#13;including the customer&amp;#8217;s historical payment experience or
 in the case of a new customer


 which typically&#13;includes volume-based rebates
 known or expected pricing or revenue adjustments
 such as trade discounts
 allowances for non-saleable&#13;products
 product returns
 trade incentives and coupon redemption

 such as pricing and quantities&#13;ordered
 are established on a frequent basis such that most customer arrangements and related incentives have a one year or shorter&#13;duration. As such
 we do not capitalize contract inception costs and we capitalize product fulfillment costs in accordance with&#13;U.S. GAAP and our inventory policies. We do not have any significant deferred revenue or unbilled receivables at the end of a period.&#13;We generally do not receive noncash consideration for the sale of goods

 which have not been material


 valued on a first in
 first out basis (&amp;#8220;FIFO&amp;#8221;). The costs of finished goods inventories&#13;include raw materials
 direct labor



 which do not improve&#13;or extend the life of the assets

 or more frequently if certain conditions exist
 using a combination of the&#13;fair values derived from both the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach
 we calculate the fair value&#13;of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on our estimates&#13;of revenue growth rates and operating margins
 taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The discount rate used&#13;to determine the present value of future cash flows is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant&#13;risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the&#13;projected cash flows. The market approach estimates fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable&#13;publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics. The resulting fair value
 based on the income&#13;and market approaches
 is then compared to the carrying value to determine if impairment is necessary. In the fourth quarter of&#13;2018
 we early adopted ASU 2017-04
&amp;#160;Intangibles &amp;#8212; Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment

&#13;if certain conditions exist. The qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate&#13;it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If
 based&#13;on this qualitative assessment
 we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset&#13;is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment
 a quantitative assessment is performed&#13;to determine whether an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment exists. We test the indefinite-lived intangible assets for&#13;impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair value based on current revenue projections of the related operations

 such as a change in the competitive landscape
 any internal decisions&#13;to pursue new or different strategies
 a loss of a significant customer
 or a significant change in the market place including&#13;changes in the prices paid for our products or changes in the size of the market for our products. If an evaluation of the undiscounted&#13;cash flows indicates impairment
 the asset is written down to its estimated fair value
 which is generally based on discounted&#13;future cash flows. If the estimated remaining useful life of an intangible asset is changed

 plus or minus changes resulting from&#13;observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. During October 2019
&#13;the Company sold approximately 45.6% of one of its investments recorded under the cost method and recognized a $1

 which is recorded in other income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company also recorded&#13;an unrealized gain of $1

 which is recorded in other income&#13;(expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31
 2019
 the Company has one investment without a readily&#13;determinable fair value which is recorded at $1

 state
 local and foreign income taxes currently payable
 and those deferred because of temporary differences between the&#13;financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference&#13;between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable&#13;income in the year in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The principal sources&#13;of temporary differences are different depreciation and amortization methods for financial statement and tax purposes
 net operating&#13;carryforwards
 incentive compensation
 unrealized gain
 capitalization of indirect inventory costs for tax purposes
 reserves for&#13;excess and obsolete inventory
 the allowance for doubtful accounts

 as well as all open tax years in these&#13;jurisdictions. We recognize the income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that
 based on&#13;technical merits
 the position will be sustained upon examination
 including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes.&#13;We apply a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly
 we recognize&#13;the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in&#13;judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the period of such change.&#13;For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained
 no tax benefit has been&#13;recognized in the financial statements. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits can change due to audit settlements

 the FASB issued Accounting&#13;Standards Update (&amp;#8220;ASU&amp;#8221;) No. 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842)
 which affects any entity that enters into a lease (as that&#13;term is defined in ASU 2016-02)
 with some specified scope exceptions. Under ASU 2016-02
 companies can adopt the amended guidance&#13;using a modified retrospective transition approach
 using an application date of either the beginning of the earliest comparative&#13;period presented or the beginning of the reporting period in which the companies first apply the new standard. We adopted this&#13;standard on January 1
 2019 using the application date of January 1
 2019
 and elected certain practical expedients allowed under&#13;the standard. In July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11
 Leases (842)
 Targeted Improvements
 which provides an additional&#13;transition election to not restate comparative periods for the effects of applying the new standard. The guidance requires lessees&#13;to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements

 this&#13;practical expedient allowed us to carryforward the historical lease classification
 and not reassess initial direct costs for any&#13;existing leases as of January 1
 2019 or reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases. In addition
&#13;we elected to adopt the hindsight practical expedient to determine the reasonably certain lease term for existing leases. We made&#13;an accounting policy election to continue recording leases with an initial term of 12 months or less consistent with our prior&#13;financial reporting and elect the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components. We have revised our relevant policies&#13;and procedures
 as applicable
 to meet the new accounting

 since all our leases are operating leases under ASC 840 and we will&#13;carryforward the historical lease classification
 the new standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Statements&#13;of Operations

 Financial Instruments&amp;#8212;Credit&#13;Losses. The series of new guidance amends the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forward-looking approach based on&#13;expected losses rather than incurred losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments
 including trade&#13;receivables. This may result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. The guidance should be applied on either a prospective&#13;transition or modified-retrospective approach depending on the subtopic. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning&#13;after December 15
 2022
 including interim periods within those fiscal years

 noting no impairment loss. The fair value exceeded&#13;the carrying value by 2.4%. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate goodwill for impairment. We estimate fair&#13;value using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiples analysis with respect to&#13;our single reporting unit. These valuation approaches are dependent upon a number of factors
 including estimates of future growth&#13;rates
 our cost of capital
 capital expenditures
 income tax rates
 and other variables. Assumptions used in our valuations were&#13;consistent with our internal projections and operating plans. Our discounted cash flows forecast could be negatively impacted by&#13;a change in the competitive landscape
 any internal decisions to pursue new or different strategies
 a loss of a significant customer
&#13;or a significant change in the market place including changes in the prices paid for our products or changes in the size of the&#13;market for our products. Additionally
 under the market approach analysis
 we used significant other observable inputs including&#13;various guideline company comparisons. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable

 in each case
 as the same is reduced by the aggregate principal&#13;amount outstanding under the Loans. &amp;#8220;Borrowing Base&amp;#8221; under the Revolving Credit Facility means
 generally
 an amount&#13;equal to our cash and cash equivalents plus our eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory
 less certain reserves

 warranties
 and covenants on the part of Lifeway
 including financial covenants requiring us to achieve&#13;a minimum EBITDA threshold for each of the fiscal quarters through December 31

 and (b) a Senior Debt to EBITDA ratio of not more than 3.00 to 1.0 at December 31
 2018 and for each&#13;of the succeeding fiscal quarters ending through the expiration date. The Revolving Credit Facility also provides for events of&#13;default
 including failure to repay principal and interest when due and failure to perform or violation of the provisions or covenants&#13;of the agreement

 Lifeway entered into&#13;the Second Modification to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement
 as amended
 (the &amp;#8220;Second Modification&amp;#8221;)&#13;with its existing lender. The Second Modification amends the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement
 as amended
 by redefining&#13;the &amp;#8220;Borrowing Base&amp;#8221; and further clarifying the definitions of &amp;#8220;Eligible Accounts&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Eligible&#13;Inventory.&amp;#8221; The &amp;#8220;Borrowing Base&amp;#8221; under this amendment means
 generally
 an amount equal to the sum of (a) 85%&#13;of the unpaid amount of all eligible accounts receivable

 all outstanding amounts under&#13;the Loans bear interest
 based on a level of the Senior Debt to EBITDA ratio
 at Lifeway&amp;#8217;s election
 at either the lender&#13;Base Rate (the greater of either the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.0% to 0.5%
 or the Prime Rate) or the LIBOR plus 2.25% to 3.00%
&#13;payable monthly in arrears. Lifeway is also required to pay a quarterly unused line fee of 0.25% and
 in conjunction with the issuance&#13;of any letters of credit
 a letter of credit fee. Lifeway&amp;#8217;s interest rate on debt outstanding under our Revolving Credit&#13;Facility as of December 31

 the Modified Revolving Credit&#13;Facility contains customary representations
 warranties
 and covenants on the part of Lifeway
 including financial covenants requiring&#13;us to achieve a minimum EBITDA threshold for each of the fiscal quarters through December 31
 2019
 and maintain a fixed charge&#13;coverage ratio of no less than 1.25 to 1.00 for each of the fiscal quarters ending through the expiration date. The Modified Revolving&#13;Credit Facility also provides for events of default
 including failure to repay principal and interest when due and failure to&#13;perform or violation of the provisions or covenants of the agreement



&#13;claims
 and proceedings arising in the normal course of business
 including commercial disputes
 product liabilities

 on a periodic basis
 developments in legal matters that could affect the amount of any accrual and developments that&#13;would make a loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. If a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable
&#13;we do not establish an accrued liability. Currently
 none of our accruals for outstanding legal matters are material individually&#13;or in the aggregate to our financial position and it is management&amp;#8217;s opinion that the ultimate resolution of these outstanding&#13;legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition
 results of operations
 or cash flows.&#13;However
 if we ultimately are required to make payments in connection with an adverse outcome
 it is possible that it could have&#13;a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition

 including for each such contingency the following
 among other factors: (i) the procedural status&#13;of the case; (ii) whether the case has or may be certified as a class action suit; (iii) the outcome of preliminary motions; (iv)&#13;the impact of discovery; (v) whether there are significant factual issues to be determined or resolved; (vi) whether the proceedings&#13;involve a large number of parties and/or parties and claims in multiple jurisdictions or jurisdictions in which the relevant laws&#13;are complex or unclear; (vii) the extent of potential damages
 which are often unspecified or indeterminate; and (viii) the status&#13;of settlement discussions
 if any
 and the settlement posture of the parties. Consequently
 Lifeway cannot predict with any reasonable&#13;certainty the timing or outcome of such contingencies

 2015
 Lifeway&amp;#8217;s&#13;Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program (the &amp;#8220;2015 stock repurchase program&amp;#8221;) under which we may
&#13;from time to time
 repurchase shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed the lesser of $3
500 or&#13;250 shares. On November 1
 2017
 the Board amended the 2015 stock repurchase program (the &amp;#8220;2017 amendment&amp;#8221;)
 by adding&#13;to (i.e.
 exclusive of the shares previously authorized under the 2015 stock repurchase program) the authorization the lesser of&#13;$5
185 or 625 shares. Under the amended authorization
 share repurchases may be executed through various means
 including without&#13;limitation in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions
 in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations
&#13;including without limitation Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended. The extent to which Lifeway repurchases&#13;its shares and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon a variety of factors
 including market conditions
 regulatory requirements&#13;and other corporate considerations. The repurchase program does not obligate us to purchase any shares
 and the program may be&#13;terminated

 Products and Customers).&#13;We also sell bulk cream
 a byproduct of our fluid milk manufacturing process. In accordance with ASC 606
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 we recognize revenue when control over the products transfers to&#13;our customers
 which generally occurs upon delivery to our customers or their common carriers. The Company adopted this standard&#13;at the beginning of fiscal year 2018
 with no significant impact to its financial position or results of operations
 using the&#13;modified retrospective method. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled&#13;to receive in exchange for these goods or services

 the contract is the approved&#13;sales order
 which may also be supplemented by other agreements that formalize various terms and conditions with customers. The&#13;Company applies judgment in determining the customer&amp;#8217;s ability and intention to pay
 which is based on a variety of factors&#13;including the customer&amp;#8217;s historical payment experience or
 in the case of a new customer


 which typically&#13;includes volume-based rebates

 trade incentives and coupon redemption

 such as pricing and quantities&#13;ordered
 are established on a frequent basis such that most customer arrangements and related incentives have a one year or shorter&#13;duration. As such
 we do not capitalize contract inception costs and we capitalize product fulfillment costs in accordance with&#13;U.S. GAAP and our inventory policies. We do not have any significant deferred revenue or unbilled receivables at the end of a period.&#13;We generally do not receive noncash consideration for the sale of goods


 which have not been material

 or more frequently if certain conditions exist
 using a&#13;combination of the fair values derived from both the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach
 we&#13;calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections&#13;are based on our estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins
 taking into consideration industry and market&#13;conditions. The discount rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows is based on the weighted-average cost&#13;of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to&#13;the business's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. The market approach estimates fair value based on market&#13;multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment&#13;characteristics. The resulting fair value
 based on the income and market approaches
 is then compared to the carrying value&#13;to determine if impairment is necessary. In the fourth quarter of 2018
 we early adopted ASU 2017-04
 Intangibles&#13;&amp;#8212; Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment

&#13;if certain conditions exist. The qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate&#13;it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If
 based&#13;on this qualitative assessment
 we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset&#13;is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment
 a quantitative assessment is performed&#13;to determine whether an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment exists. We test the indefinite-lived intangible assets for&#13;impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair value based on current revenue projections of the related operations

 such as a change in the competitive landscape
 any internal decisions&#13;to pursue new or different strategies
 a loss of a significant customer
 or a significant change in the market place including&#13;changes in the prices paid for our products or changes in the size of the market for our products. If an evaluation of the undiscounted&#13;cash flows indicates impairment
 the asset is written down to its estimated fair value
 which is generally based on discounted&#13;future cash flows. If the estimated remaining useful life of an intangible asset is changed

 and those deferred because of temporary differences between the&#13;financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference&#13;between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable&#13;income in the year in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The principal sources&#13;of temporary differences are different depreciation and amortization methods for financial statement and tax purposes

 incentive compensation
 unrealized gain
 capitalization of indirect inventory costs for tax purposes
 reserves for&#13;excess and obsolete inventory

 as well as all open tax years in these&#13;jurisdictions. We recognize the income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that
 based on&#13;technical merits
 the position will be sustained upon examination
 including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes.&#13;We apply a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly
 we recognize&#13;the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in&#13;judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the period of such change.&#13;For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained
 no tax benefit has been&#13;recognized in the financial statements. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits can change due to audit settlements

 the FASB issued Accounting&#13;Standards Update (&amp;#8220;ASU&amp;#8221;) No. 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842)
 which affects any entity that enters into a lease (as that&#13;term is defined in ASU 2016-02)
 with some specified scope exceptions. Under ASU 2016-02
 companies can adopt the amended guidance&#13;using a modified retrospective transition approach
 using an application date of either the beginning of the earliest comparative&#13;period presented or the beginning of the reporting period in which the companies first apply the new standard. We adopted this&#13;standard on January 1
 2019 using the application date of January 1
 2019
 and elected certain practical expedients allowed under&#13;the standard. In July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11
 Leases (842)
 Targeted Improvements
 which provides an additional&#13;transition election to not restate comparative periods for the effects of applying the new standard. The guidance requires lessees&#13;to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements

 this&#13;practical expedient allowed us to carryforward the historical lease classification
 and not reassess initial direct costs for any&#13;existing leases as of January 1
 2019 or reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases. In addition
&#13;we elected to adopt the hindsight practical expedient to determine the reasonably certain lease term for existing leases. We made&#13;an accounting policy election to continue recording leases with an initial term of 12 months or less consistent with our prior&#13;financial reporting and elect the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components. We have revised our relevant policies&#13;and procedures
 as applicable
 to meet the new accounting

 since all our leases are operating leases under ASC 840 and we will carryforward the historical&#13;lease classification
 the new standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Operations
 Consolidated&#13;Statements of Stockholders&amp;#8217; Equity
 or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31
 2019. The adoption&#13;resulted in an increase of the right-of-use assets of approximately $944 and lease liabilities of $997
 and an adjustment to beginning&#13;retained earnings of $53 as of January 1


 the FASB issued ASU No.&#13;2020-04
 Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The new&#13;guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to contracts
&#13;hedging relationships
 and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because&#13;of reference rate reform. The guidance will be effective prospectively as of March 12
 2020 through December 31

 the FASB issued ASU No.&#13;2019-12
 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The new guidance is intended to enhance and simplify&#13;various aspects of the accounting for income taxes. The new guidance &lt;font style=background-color: white&gt;eliminates certain exceptions&#13;to the general approach to the income tax accounting model
 and adds new guidance to reduce the complexity in accounting for income&#13;taxes.&lt;/font&gt; The guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2020 and interim periods within those&#13;fiscal years. Early adoption of the amendments is permitted

 ASU 2019-10

 Derivatives and Hedging (Topic&#13;815)
 and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates
 and ASU 2019-11
 Codification Improvements to Topic 326
 Financial Instruments&amp;#8212;Credit&#13;Losses. The series of new guidance amends the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forward-looking approach based on&#13;expected losses rather than incurred losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments
 including trade&#13;receivables. This may result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. The guidance should be applied on either a prospective&#13;transition or modified-retrospective approach depending on the subtopic. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning&#13;after December 15
 2022
 including interim periods within those fiscal years

rent payments to reimburse the landlord for operating expenses and taxes. The Company also lease certain machinery and equipment
with fixed base rent payments and variable costs based on usage. Remaining lease terms for these leases range from less than 1
year to 5 years. Some of our leases include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years and have been included in our calculation
of the right-of-use asset and lease liabilities. Lifeway includes only fixed payments for lease components in the measurement
of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Variable lease payments are those that vary because of changes in facts or circumstances
occurring after the commencement date
 other than the passage of time. There are no residual value guarantees. We do not currently
have leases which meet the finance lease classification as defined under ASC 842.

date. We have elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components into a single component for all of its
leases. For many of our leases such as real estate leases
 we are unable to determine an implicit rate; therefore
 we use our incremental
borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments
for those leases. We include options to extend or terminate the lease in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability
when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term.

Note 2 &#8211; Summary of significant
accounting policies 




statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant
estimates made in preparing the consolidated financial statements include the reserve for promotional allowances
 the valuation
of goodwill and intangible assets
 stock-based and incentive compensation
 and deferred income taxes.

to assess an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related disclosure in certain circumstances.
There were no conditions or events

 that raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued.

price over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets acquired. We estimate the fair value of
our one reporting unit annually (as of December 31)
 or more frequently if certain conditions exist
 using a combination of the
fair values derived from both the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach
 we calculate the fair value
of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on our estimates
of revenue growth rates and operating margins
 taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The discount rate used
to determine the present value of future cash flows is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant
risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the
projected cash flows. The market approach estimates fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable
publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics. The resulting fair value
 based on the income
and market approaches
 is then compared to the carrying value to determine if impairment is necessary. In the fourth quarter of
2018
 we early adopted ASU 2017-04
&#160;Intangibles &#8212; Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment
which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test.


asset impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently
if certain conditions exist. The qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate
it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If
 based
on this qualitative assessment
 we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset
is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment
 a quantitative assessment is performed
to determine whether an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment exists. We test the indefinite-lived intangible assets for
impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair value based on current revenue projections of the related operations
 under
the relief from royalty method. Any excess of the carrying value over the amount of fair value is recognized as an impairment.
Any such impairment would be recognized in full in the reporting period in which it has been identified.




combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Identifiable intangible assets with finite
lives are amortized over their estimate useful lives as follows:



    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    



in Amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.


for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Lifeway conducts
more frequent impairment assessments if certain conditions exist
 such as a change in the competitive landscape
 any internal decisions
to pursue new or different strategies
 a loss of a significant customer
 or a significant change in the market place including
changes in the prices paid for our products or changes in the size of the market for our products. If an evaluation of the undiscounted
cash flows indicates impairment
 the asset is written down to its estimated fair value
 which is generally based on discounted
future cash flows. If the estimated remaining useful life of an intangible asset is changed
 the remaining carrying amount of the
intangible asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life.




following hierarchy
 which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within
the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:

Quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Observable
inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
 quoted prices for identical or similar
assets or liabilities in inactive markets
 or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data
for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Inputs that are
generally unobservable and typically reflect management&#8217;s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing
the asset or liability.


that are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis include cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 other receivables
accounts payable
 accrued expenses and revolving line of credit for which carrying value approximates fair value.


equity securities without a readily determinable fair value at cost minus impairment

 plus or minus changes resulting from
observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. During October 2019
the Company sold approximately 45.6% of one of its investments recorded under the cost method and recognized a $1
438 gain on sale
of investment
 which is recorded in other income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company also recorded
an unrealized gain of $1
731 resulting from the observable price change of this transaction
 which is recorded in other income
(expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31
 2019
 the Company has one investment without a readily
determinable fair value which is recorded at $1
800 in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.




federal
 state
 local and foreign income taxes currently payable
 and those deferred because of temporary differences between the
financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference
between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the year in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The principal sources
of temporary differences are different depreciation and amortization methods for financial statement and tax purposes
 net operating
carryforwards
 incentive compensation
 unrealized gain
 capitalization of indirect inventory costs for tax purposes
 reserves for
excess and obsolete inventory
 the allowance for doubtful accounts
 and interest expense limitations.


deferred tax assets when it is more likely not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Deferred income tax expense or benefit
is based on the changes in the asset or liability from period to period.



all the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns
 as well as all open tax years in these
jurisdictions. We recognize the income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that
 based on
technical merits
 the position will be sustained upon examination
 including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes.
We apply a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly
 we recognize
the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in
judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the period of such change.
For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained
 no tax benefit has been
recognized in the financial statements. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits can change due to audit settlements
 tax
examination activities
 statute expirations and the recognition and measurement criteria under accounting for uncertainty in income
taxes. Lifeway recognizes penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision (benefit) for income taxes
in the consolidated statements of operations.

 the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842)
 which affects any entity that enters into a lease (as that
term is defined in ASU 2016-02)
 with some specified scope exceptions. Under ASU 2016-02
 companies can adopt the amended guidance
using a modified retrospective transition approach
 using an application date of either the beginning of the earliest comparative
period presented or the beginning of the reporting period in which the companies first apply the new standard. We adopted this
standard on January 1
 2019 using the application date of January 1
 2019
 and elected certain practical expedients allowed under
the standard. In July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11
 Leases (842)
 Targeted Improvements
 which provides an additional
transition election to not restate comparative periods for the effects of applying the new standard. The guidance requires lessees
to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements
such as information about variable lease payments and options to renew and terminate leases. The amended guidance will require
both operating and finance leases to be recognized in the balance sheet. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial
position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying
asset for the lease term.


expedients that are permitted under the transition guidance within ASU 2016-02 and related standards. Among other things
 this
practical expedient allowed us to carryforward the historical lease classification
 and not reassess initial direct costs for any
existing leases as of January 1
 2019 or reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases. In addition
we elected to adopt the hindsight practical expedient to determine the reasonably certain lease term for existing leases. We made
an accounting policy election to continue recording leases with an initial term of 12 months or less consistent with our prior
financial reporting and elect the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components. We have revised our relevant policies
and procedures
 as applicable
 to meet the new accounting
 reporting and disclosure requirements of Topic 842 and have updated
internal controls accordingly.


guidance in ASU 2016-02 and prior GAAP is the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases
classified as operating leases under current GAAP. Recognition of the right-of-use assets and liabilities had a material impact
to our consolidated balance sheet upon adoption. However
 since all our leases are operating leases under ASC 840 and we will
carryforward the historical lease classification
 the new standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Statements
of Operations
 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders&#8217; Equity
 or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended
December 31
 2019. The adoption resulted in an increase of the right-of-use assets of approximately $944 and lease liabilities
of $997
 and an adjustment to beginning retained earnings of $53 as of January 1
 2019.




 the FASB issued ASU No.
2020-04
 Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The new
guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to contracts
hedging relationships
 and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because
of reference rate reform. The guidance will be effective prospectively as of March 12
 2020 through December 31
 2022 and interim
periods within those fiscal years. Management is currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on the consolidated
financial statements.


 the FASB issued ASU No.
2019-12
 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The new guidance is intended to enhance and simplify

to the general approach to the income tax accounting model
 and adds new guidance to reduce the complexity in accounting for income

 2020 and interim periods within those
fiscal years. Early adoption of the amendments is permitted
 including adoption in any interim period for public business entities
for periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. Management is currently evaluating the impact that the new
guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.


 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13
Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
 in November 2018
issued an amendment
 ASU 2018-19
 Codification Improvements to Topic 326
 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
 and in November
2019 issued two amendments
 ASU 2019-10
 Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses (Topic 326)
 Derivatives and Hedging (Topic
815)
 and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates
 and ASU 2019-11
 Codification Improvements to Topic 326
 Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit
Losses. The series of new guidance amends the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forward-looking approach based on
expected losses rather than incurred losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments
 including trade
receivables. This may result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. The guidance should be applied on either a prospective
transition or modified-retrospective approach depending on the subtopic. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning
after December 15
 2022
 including interim periods within those fiscal years
 with early adoption permitted. Management is currently
evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.

 we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset
is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment
 a quantitative assessment is performed
to determine whether an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment exists. We test the indefinite-lived intangible assets for
impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair value based on current revenue projections of the related operations
 under
the relief from royalty method. Any excess of the carrying value over the amount of fair value is recognized as an impairment.
Any such impairment would be recognized in full in the reporting period in which it has been identified.




combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Identifiable intangible assets with finite
lives are amortized over their estimate useful lives as follows:

for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Lifeway conducts
more frequent impairment assessments if certain conditions exist
 such as a change in the competitive landscape
 any internal decisions
to pursue new or different strategies
 a loss of a significant customer
 or a significant change in the market place including
changes in the prices paid for our products or changes in the size of the market for our products. If an evaluation of the undiscounted
cash flows indicates impairment
 the asset is written down to its estimated fair value
 which is generally based on discounted
future cash flows. If the estimated remaining useful life of an intangible asset is changed
 the remaining carrying amount of the
intangible asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life.







following hierarchy
 which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within
the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:

Quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Observable
inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
 quoted prices for identical or similar
assets or liabilities in inactive markets
 or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data
for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Inputs that are
generally unobservable and typically reflect management&#8217;s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing
the asset or liability.


that are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis include cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 other receivables
accounts payable
 accrued expenses and revolving line of credit for which carrying value approximates fair value.


equity securities without a readily determinable fair value at cost minus impairment
 if any
 plus or minus changes resulting from
observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. During October 2019
the Company sold approximately 45.6% of one of its investments recorded under the cost method and recognized a $1
438 gain on sale
of investment
 which is recorded in other income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company also recorded
an unrealized gain of $1
731 resulting from the observable price change of this transaction
 which is recorded in other income
(expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31
 2019
 the Company has one investment without a readily
determinable fair value which is recorded at $1
800 in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.







federal
 state
 local and foreign income taxes currently payable
 and those deferred because of temporary differences between the
financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference
between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the year in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The principal sources
of temporary differences are different depreciation and amortization methods for financial statement and tax purposes
 net operating
carryforwards
 incentive compensation
 unrealized gain
 capitalization of indirect inventory costs for tax purposes
 reserves for
excess and obsolete inventory
 the allowance for doubtful accounts
 and interest expense limitations.


deferred tax assets when it is more likely not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Deferred income tax expense or benefit
is based on the changes in the asset or liability from period to period.



all the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns
 as well as all open tax years in these
jurisdictions. We recognize the income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that
 based on
technical merits
 the position will be sustained upon examination
 including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes.
We apply a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly
 we recognize
the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in
judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the period of such change.
For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained
 no tax benefit has been
recognized in the financial statements. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits can change due to audit settlements
 tax
examination activities
 statute expirations and the recognition and measurement criteria under accounting for uncertainty in income
taxes. Lifeway recognizes penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision (benefit) for income taxes
in the consolidated statements of operations.

 the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842)
 which affects any entity that enters into a lease (as that
term is defined in ASU 2016-02)
 with some specified scope exceptions. Under ASU 2016-02
 companies can adopt the amended guidance
using a modified retrospective transition approach
 using an application date of either the beginning of the earliest comparative
period presented or the beginning of the reporting period in which the companies first apply the new standard. We adopted this
standard on January 1
 2019 using the application date of January 1
 2019
 and elected certain practical expedients allowed under
the standard. In July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11
 Leases (842)
 Targeted Improvements
 which provides an additional
transition election to not restate comparative periods for the effects of applying the new standard. The guidance requires lessees
to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements
such as information about variable lease payments and options to renew and terminate leases. The amended guidance will require
both operating and finance leases to be recognized in the balance sheet. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial
position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying
asset for the lease term.


expedients that are permitted under the transition guidance within ASU 2016-02 and related standards. Among other things
 this
practical expedient allowed us to carryforward the historical lease classification
 and not reassess initial direct costs for any
existing leases as of January 1
 2019 or reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases. In addition
we elected to adopt the hindsight practical expedient to determine the reasonably certain lease term for existing leases. We made
an accounting policy election to continue recording leases with an initial term of 12 months or less consistent with our prior
financial reporting and elect the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components. We have revised our relevant policies
and procedures
 as applicable
 to meet the new accounting
 reporting and disclosure requirements of Topic 842 and have updated
internal controls accordingly.


in ASU 2016-02 and prior GAAP is the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified
as operating leases under current GAAP. Recognition of the right-of-use assets and liabilities had a material impact to our consolidated
balance sheet upon adoption. However
 since all our leases are operating leases under ASC 840 and we will carryforward the historical
lease classification
 the new standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Operations
 Consolidated
Statements of Stockholders&#8217; Equity
 or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31
 2019. The adoption
resulted in an increase of the right-of-use assets of approximately $944 and lease liabilities of $997
 and an adjustment to beginning
retained earnings of $53 as of January 1
 2019.







 the FASB issued ASU No.
2020-04
 Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The new
guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to contracts
hedging relationships
 and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because
of reference rate reform. The guidance will be effective prospectively as of March 12
 2020 through December 31
 2022 and interim
periods within those fiscal years. Management is currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on the consolidated
financial statements.


 the FASB issued ASU No.

 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The new guidance is intended to enhance and simplify

to the general approach to the income tax accounting model
 and adds new guidance to reduce the complexity in accounting for income

 2020 and interim periods within those
fiscal years. Early adoption of the amendments is permitted
 including adoption in any interim period for public business entities
for periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. Management is currently evaluating the impact that the new
guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.

Losses. The series of new guidance amends the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forward-looking approach based on
expected losses rather than incurred losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments
 including trade
receivables. This may result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. The guidance should be applied on either a prospective
transition or modified-retrospective approach depending on the subtopic. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning
after December 15
 2022
 including interim periods within those fiscal years
 with early adoption permitted. Management is currently
evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.
