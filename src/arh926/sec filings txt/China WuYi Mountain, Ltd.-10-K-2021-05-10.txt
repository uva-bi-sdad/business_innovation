We believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing

a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months
unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until
we begin selling bottled water. There is no assurance we will ever reach that stage.

on our financial statements for the fiscal years ended August 31
 2019 and August 31
 2018
 that conditions exist that raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to our recurring losses from operations
 deficit in equity
 and the need to
raise additional capital to fund operations. A &ldquo;going concern&rdquo; opinion could impair our ability to finance our operations
through the sale of debt or equity securities.

 2019

500
resulting in a net loss of $85
794. The decrease in expenses from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the decrease in transfer
agent expenses and consulting fees.



2019 financial statements expresses an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as an ongoing business. Since
our sole director maybe unwilling or unable to loan or advance us additional capital
 we believe that if we do not raise additional capital
over the next 12 months
 we may be required to suspend or cease the implementation of our business plans. See &ldquo;August 31

Additional funding may not be available on favorable terms

 the financial statements). In our opinion
 the financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects

 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period then ended
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

 the Company has
a losse from operations through August 31
 2019
 and does not have sufficient working capital to fund its planned operations during the
twelve-month period subsequent to the issuance of these financial statements. This raises substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters also are described in Note 1. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements

to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis

Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management

the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Accordingly
 actual results could differ from those estimates.

ASC topic 605 &ldquo;Revenue Recognition
 and other applicable revenue recognition guidance under US GAAP. &nbsp;Sales revenue is recognized
for our retail and wholesale customers when: (i) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists
 (ii) the sales terms are fixed or
determinable
 (iii) title and risk of loss have transferred
 and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured &mdash; generally when products
are shipped to the customer and services are rendered
 except in situations in which title passes upon receipt of the products by the
customer.&nbsp;Revenue consists of revenue earned for the sale of organic coconut water and services provided by the Company. Revenue
is recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and or services provided by the Company are fulfilled.




 financial liabilities

for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows


the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and disclosed; otherwise only available information
pertinent to fair value has been disclosed.




by dividing the Company&rsquo;s net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the
year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company&rsquo;s net income (loss) available to common shareholders
by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding
is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the
same as basic earnings (loss) per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company.




for income taxes. Under this method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances and
tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to
apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive
enactment.

assets must reflect that portion of the income tax loss carry forwards that is more likely-than-not to be realized from future operations.
The Company has chosen to provide a full valuation allowance against all available income tax loss carry forwards. The Company has recognized
a valuation allowance for the deferred income tax asset since the Company cannot be assured that it is more likely than not that such
benefit will be utilized in future

When circumstances change
 and which cause a change in management's judgment about the realizability of deferred income tax assets
 the
impact of the change on the valuation allowance is generally reflected in current income.


 2017
 new federal tax reform legislation
was enacted in the United States (the &ldquo;2017 Tax Act&rdquo;)
 resulting in significant changes from previous tax law. The 2017 Tax
Act reduces the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35% effective July 1
 2018 for the Company. The rate change
 along with
certain immaterial changes in tax basis resulting from the 2017 Tax Act
 resulted in a reduction of the Company&rsquo;s deferred tax assets
of $4
838 and a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance.


 2019
 and
August 31

associated with unrecognized income tax benefits is to include such items as tax expense. No interest or penalties have been recorded
during the year ended August 31
 2019 and August 31
 2018 and no interest or penalties have been accrued as of August 31
 2019 and August

be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate
 to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.


 as required
by Rule 13a -15d and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our company&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision
and with the participation of our company&rsquo;s management
 including our company&rsquo;s principal executive officer and principal
financial officer. Based upon that evaluation
 our company&rsquo;s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded
that as of August 31
 2018 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the existence of material weaknesses in our
internal controls over financial reporting.

Management&rsquo;s Annual Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting


maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by
 or under the supervision of
 the Company&rsquo;s
Principal Executive and Principal Financial officer and effected by the Company&rsquo;s board of directors
 management and other personnel
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures
that:



    
    
    




    
    
    




    
    
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. &nbsp;


internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in
SEC guidance on conducting such assessments as of the end of the period covered by this report. Management conducted the assessment based
on certain criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission in 2013. As of August 31
 2019
 management determined material weaknesses occurred over our internal control over
financial reporting as discussed below.




    
    




that the Company&rsquo;s management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's board of directors
resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation
of duties consistent with control objectives; (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting
with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (4) ineffective controls over period
end financial disclosure and reporting processes. Due to these material weaknesses management concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was not effective as of August 31
 2019.




forth in items (2)
 (3) and (4) above did not have an effect on the Company's previous reported financial results. However
 management
believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's board of directors
resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures can result in the
Company's determination to its financial statements for the future periods.


As part of this commitment
 we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel
resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to the Company: i) Appointing one
or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to the audit committee of the Company resulting in a fully
functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures;
and ii) Preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial
reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements.


more outside directors
 who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee
 will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee
and a lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's Board. In addition
 management believes that preparing and implementing
sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the following material weaknesses (i) insufficient written policies and procedures
for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and
(ii) ineffective controls over period end financial close and reporting processes. Further
 management believes that the hiring of additional
personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge will result proper segregation of duties and provide more checks and balances
within the department. Additional personnel will also provide the cross training needed to support the Company if personnel turn over
issues within the department occur. This coupled with the appointment of additional outside directors will greatly decrease any control
and procedure issues the company may encounter in the future.


of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking
further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements
 as necessary and as funds allow.

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;The amount taken into income as deferred income&#13;tax assets must reflect that portion of the income tax loss carry forwards that is more likely-than-not to be realized from future&#13;operations. The Company has chosen to provide a full valuation allowance against all available income tax loss carry forwards. The&#13;Company has recognized a valuation allowance for the deferred income tax asset since the Company cannot be assured that it is more&#13;likely than not that such benefit will be utilized in future years. The valuation allowance is reviewed annually. When circumstances&#13;change, and which cause a change in management's judgment about the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the impact of the&#13;change on the valuation allowance is generally reflected in current income.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;On December 22, 2017, new federal tax reform legislation&#13;was enacted in the United States (the &amp;#8220;2017 Tax Act&amp;#8221;), resulting in significant changes from previous tax law. The 2017 Tax&#13;Act reduces the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35% effective July 1, 2018 for the Company. The rate change, along with&#13;certain immaterial changes in tax basis resulting from the 2017 Tax Act, resulted in a reduction of the Company&amp;#8217;s deferred tax assets&#13;of $4,838 and a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman
