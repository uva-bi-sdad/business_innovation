Global
Diversified Marketing Group Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) operates as a global multi-line consumer packaged goods (&ldquo;CPG&rdquo;)
company with branded product lines and is a food and snack manufacturer
 marketer and distributor through its subsidiary Global
Diversified Holdings
 Inc (&ldquo;GDHI&rdquo;) in the United States
 Canada
 and Europe. The Company operates in the snack market
segment and offers Italian Wafers
 French Madeleines
 Coconut Wafer Bites
 Italian Filled Croissants
 shelf-stable Macarons
and other gourmet snacks. The Company sells its products directly through various distribution channels comprising specialty
grocery retailers
 food service distributors
 direct store delivery (&ldquo;DSD&rdquo;) as well as vending
 pantry
 and
the micro-market segment. Company attends global food trade shows to seek out innovative and unique snacks products. Once the
Company identifies products that fit within its distribution channels
 company will enter into a non-exclusive manufacturing contract
with a third party to produce products under the Company&rsquo;s own trademarked brands for sale in the United States and/or global
markets. Currently
 the Company maintains five trademarks for its brands; each of which can and may cover numerous product lines
with a variety of unique identifiers (known as SKU&rsquo;s) offered under that brand name. The Company has non-contractual on-going
relationships with many Fortune 500 companies including club and retail chain stores. The Company sells directly to these companies
which purchase the items from the Company and distribute the items to their stores. The Company also sells and distributes to
DSD distributors and food-service distributors which in turn service vending machine channels as well as micro-markets and coffee
pantr

The
Company sells its products throughout the United States and global markets to buyers which typically represent recognized large
retail chain stores. The products are then distributed by the chains to their local outlets. The Company seeks out and develops
snacks and gourmet foods to brand under its trademarks based on management&rsquo;s beliefs as to consumer demand. The Company
works closely with buyers to evaluate products with the intent to identify products that have likely customer demand.

The
Company intends to continue to seek to develop additional gourmet foods and snack products under its trademarked brands and to
expand the Company&rsquo;s offering portfolio by identifying
 producing
 and marketing new products. Management believes
that the strategy of acquiring small regional brands and adding these to the Company&rsquo;s national distribution can prove beneficial
for the Company.

In
December 2019
 a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan
 China
 which has and is continuing to spread
throughout China and other parts of the world
 including the United States. On January 30
 2020
 the World Health Organization
declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a &ldquo;Public Health Emergency of International Concern.&rdquo;
On January 31
 2020
 U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for the United
States to aid the U.S. healthcare community in responding to COVID-19
 and on March 11
 2020 the World Health Organization characterized
the outbreak as a &ldquo;pandemic&rdquo;. The significant outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a widespread health crisis that
has adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide
 and has adversely affected our business
 results of operations
and financial condition.&nbsp; While we are unable to quantify the impact
 we are aware that our restrictions on access to retail stores and other commercial activities
has had an adverse effect on our results.


above 2019 levels. We believe our revenue increase in 2020 would have been in excess of what we recorded had we not experienced
the impact of Covid-19.


 2021 we announced that we
had successfully secured placement with a National Club Store Chain &ldquo;Store Chain&rdquo; for our premium snack to be stocked
and sold in the Northeast Region. The initial order we received amounted to $282
880. We expect to receive additional orders although
there can be no assurances.

Vending
Operations

In
addition to placing its products with large retail specialty chains
 the Company supplies products to vending channels throughout
the United States through food service distributors. These vending machines are located in malls
 service stations
 and schools.
The Company works with vending companies that have
 in the aggregate
 more than 100
000 machines nationwide. The Company supplies
vending companies with products. The Company works directly with some vending companies and with others through its food service
distributors. The broker pre-sells the products and the distributor services the accounts. When the distributor services the accounts
the distributor buys the product directly Vending machine sales represent approximately 6% to 9% of our revenues.

Products
and Trademarked Brands

The
Company currently has five trademark brands. Each brand encompasses numerous SKUs that are brought to the market from time to
time. The Company produces its products primarily on an &ldquo;on request&rdquo; basis from its retail chain buyers for sale through
such chains.

The
Company&rsquo;s trademark brands are listed on the left below with sample products for several of the trademarked brands itemized:

Retail
Chain Buyers

The
primary distribution of the Company&rsquo;s products is through specialty retail chains. The Company works with the buying office
that determines placement for the Company&rsquo;s products. The retail will then distribute the products to its retail outlets.



Management
believes that the Company&rsquo;s products appeal to a wide range of consumers
 including most age brackets. The young snackers
classified as those being between the ages of 18-34
 tend to consume more snacks than average adults but the gourmet foods reach
the broader adult market. The senior market tends to reduce snacks and gourmet foods.

The
Company anticipates that its marketing strategy will use the internet and social media including Facebook
 Instagram
 and Twitter.
The Company&rsquo;s distribution channels consist of retailers
 distributors
 online e-commerce
 and vending companies.
The Company&rsquo;s marketing strategy is primarily targeted at the vendors and retail chain stores. The Company intends to utilize
social media to create direct consumer interest in its products.

The
Company anticipates utilizing the following opportunities to further their marketing program and to obtain information to adjust
and modify
 as needed
 the marketing program.:

.
Networking is a low-cost but often effective means for the Company to generate partnerships and growth while bolstering personal
commitments to the Company. Management will join wholesalers&rsquo; associations to network with other food manufacturers and
distributors.

Trade
Shows.
 such as SIAL
 PLMA
Amsterdam
 Thaifex
 Fancy Food
 CIBUS
 ISM
 and ANUGA among others. Through attendance at conventions and trade shows
 management
remains knowledgeable and informed about advancements
 trends
 and issues of concern in the market.

Direct
Sales.

Social
Media and Food Blogging. 
 such as Facebook
 Instagram
 and Twitter.
Twitter has proven an effective platform to conduct customer satisfaction surveys as well as solicit customer feedback on food
products.

The
rise in popularity of the food blogging community has given consumers a massive platform on which to share their opinion and make
their voices heard. This has led to a rise in consumer concerns about food
 with increasing emphasis being placed on healthy eating
and organic produce. The Company will use food blogging websites to promote its products and highlight benefits that appeal to
a new generation of socially-aware consumers.

Websites.

 with proper site structure
 page layout
 and clear and easy navigation
 along
with targeted keywords embedded throughout the site to ensure prominent search engine placement and saturation. The Company&rsquo;s

The
Company anticipates that it will primarily target teens and adults up to age 65. The primary target market is &ldquo;Young Snackers&rdquo;
that are 18-34 years old and tend to eat more snacks than other age groups. The trend of snacks between meals is especially strong
with millennials and younger Americans. A quarter of American millennials
 age 23 to 40
 reported eating four or more times a
day
 compared to just 10% of Gen X and 9% of Baby Boomers. The Company believes that the senior age bracket (over 65) is not a
strong snack market.



The
snack food industry in the United States is very competitive
 particularly in the savory and salty snack segment. In the United
States
 a study conducted by the Packaging Strategies reported that snacks account for 51% of all food sales
 and 92% of adults
in the US have snacked within the last 24 hours.

The
Company has observed an increased demand for &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; snacks. In the United States
 companies are finding success
in the &ldquo;snackable&rdquo; fruit and vegetable category
 such as grapes or baby carrots.

A
challenge facing entrants in the snack and gourmet food market is the dominance of leading snack food producers
 particularly
the industry leader PepsiCo. Large producers may experience a high degree of brand and consumer loyalty and typically possess
sufficient capital to invest in extensive advertising and promotions to obtain a greater market share. Furthermore
 companies
such as PepsiCo often benefit from higher profit margins when compared with small- to medium-sized operators
 enabling them to
lower their product prices and to engage in price-based competition with competitors. Multinational producers may also experience
lower per-unit costs due to economies of scale and scope.

History

The
Company
 formerly known as Dense Forest Acquisition Corporation
 was incorporated in Delaware on December 1

its name as part of a subsequent change in control. The Company filed a registration statement on Form 10 with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) on January 19
 2018

 the Company effected a change in control with the resignation of the then officers and directors
 contribution
back to the Company of 19
500
000 shares of the 20

000 outstanding shares of its common stock
 and the appointment of new
officers and directors. On June 14
 2018
 the new management of the Company issued 12
500
000 shares of its common stock to Paul
Adler
 the then president of the Company.

On
November 26
 2018
 the Company effected the acquisition of Global Diversified Holdings
 Inc.
 a private New York snack and gourmet
food company
 (&ldquo;GDHI&rdquo;) by the Company with the issuance of shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock in exchange
for the outstanding shares of common stock of GDHI. GDHI became a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of the Company (the &ldquo;Acquisition&rdquo;).
The transaction is accounted for as a combination of entities under common control since the date of the Acquisition.

Prior
to the Acquisition
 the Company had no business and no operations. Pursuant to the Acquisition
 the Company acquired the operations
and business plan of GDHI. The discussion hereinafter of the business and operations of the Company refer to the Company subsequent
to the Acquisition of GDHI and all such discussions primarily report the operations of its now subsidiary unless otherwise so
indicated.



The
Company has only one executive officer and one staff employee.



The
wholly-owned subsidiary
 Global Diversified Holdings
 Inc.
 is the Company&rsquo;s only subsidiary.

The
Company has its office headquarters at 4042 Austin Boulevard
 Suite B

60-month lease in October 2016 to rent 1

680 per year. The lease contains one five year renewal option with escalator
clauses. The Company utilizes a 3PL warehouse in Port Reading 
 New Jersey. The Company&rsquo;s website is www.360worldsnacks.com.
Management believes that its present facilities are adequate for its needs and that if it was required to do so
 it could obtain
similar facilities at a similar cost.

Management&rsquo;s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations


Prior
to the acquisition of GDHI as a subsidiary
 the Company had no operations other than the administrative operations involved with
the change in control. The information discussed herein below reflects the results of the Company&rsquo;s subsidiary
 GDHI
 an
operating company in the snack and gourmet food production
 marketing
 and distribution industry.

Discussion
of the Years Ended 2020 and 2019

Revenues
and Cost of Sales


 2020
were $1
660
726 compared to sales in 2019 of $1
317
092
 an increase of $343
634 or approximately 26.1%.
Our sales increases in the 2020 period is attributable to the addition of new customers
 new products as well as increased sales
to existing customers; offset by the impact of Covid-19.



 the Company has relied on
a small number of customers to generate a large portion of its revenue. In 2020
 four customers accounted for 91% of the Company
revenues. In 2019
 the same four customers accounted for 91% of the Company&rsquo;s revenues. Loss of any one of these four customers
would have a material adverse impact on the Company&rsquo;s profitability and liquidity.



 2020
 gross
profit was $660
815 or 39.8% of revenue compared to gross profit of $371
002 or 28.2% of revenue.
The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales (&ldquo;gross margin&rdquo;) is attributable to improved buying
efficiencies at higher levels of revenue.


Operating
expenses


31
 2020
 were $26
821
661 compared to $492
031 for the same period ended December 31
 2019. The 2020 period
includes a non-cash charge of $26
020
400 in stock-based compensation related to the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock
with super-voting rights to the Company&rsquo;s chief executive officer
 and $168
529 in non-cash charges to professional expenses
due to the issuance of restricted common shares to consultants and investment bankers
 see Note 3. Capital Stock.


020
400 and
$168
529
 operating expenses were $632
732 during the year ended December 31
 2020 compared to $492
031 or an increase of $140
701.
This increase in 2020 is primarily attributable to increased advertising expenses of approximately $74
000 in the 2020 period
to help support sales levels
 increased warehouse storage charges of approximately $21
700; increased Amazon selling fees approximately
$35
000 offset by reductions of approximately $35
000 in other general and administrative expenses.




other income items and interest expense. Other income was $5
785 for the year ended December 31
 2020
 compared to $29
955 in
other expense during the same period ended December 30
 2019. The improvement in other income and expense of $35
740 is attributable
to the recording of income for the forgiveness of $28
642 in PPP loans
 11
442 in employee retention credits related to the governments
COVID relief plans offset by an increase in interest expense of $ 4
344 over prior year levels.




 2020
 and 2019
 the Company
had $62
555 and $22
291 in cash on hand
 respectively. Net cash used in operating activities was $41
597
compared to $21
663 for the same period ended December 31
 2019. The increase in net cash used in operating activities
is primarily attributable to a reduction in operating losses in 2020 (after deducting non-cash stock compensation expense)
compared to the 2019 period; more than offset by an increase in inventory levels.


to $71
969 for the period ended December 31
 2020
 compared to $22
439 during the same period ended December 31
 2019.
The increase in net cash provided from financing activities is attributable to the receipt of $149
900 in government
PPP and EIDL loans in 2020 compared to zero in 2019
 offset by a net reduction in loans payable of $77
931 in 2020 compared to
loans of $22
269 during the comparable period in 2019.


liquidity in 2020 was provided by the SBA COVID-19 loans thus allowing the Company to reduce its reliance on factoring. Additionally
in the second half of the year the Company became marginally profitable from operations compared to losses in previous comparable
periods In the event the Company cannot maintain its profitability going forward
 it will have to rely on additional factoring
or other sources of financing such as debt or equity. There can be no assurances that other forms of financing on reasonable terms
or continued higher levels of factoring will be available to the Company in the future.

Controls
    and Procedures


Pursuant
to Rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission
 the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation
of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules. This evaluation was done as of the end of the fiscal
year under the supervision and with the participation of the Company&rsquo;s principal executive officer (who is also the principal
financial officer). There have been no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect
internal controls subsequent to the date of the evaluation. Based upon that evaluation
 the principal officer believes that the
Company&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in gathering

Management&rsquo;s
Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The
Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company&rsquo;s sole officer
 its president
 conducted an evaluation of
the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2020
 based on the criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(2013). Based on this evaluation
 management concluded that the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31
 2020
 based on those criteria. A control system can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues have been detected.

BF
Borgers CPA PC.
 Lakewood
 Colorado
 the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company
 has not issued an attestation
report on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting as no such report is required for
a smaller reporting company.

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In
the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018
 the Company changed control and consequently
 the Company&rsquo;s internal controls over its
financial reporting were transferred to new management. However
 such control rested with the principal officer prior to the change
of control and with the change of control
 it continues to rest with the principal officer
 the Company&rsquo;s sole officer.
Thus such change has not materially affected or is not reasonably likely to materially affect
 the Company&rsquo;s internal control
over financial reporting.

Officers
and Directors

The
Directors and Officers of the Company as of December 31
 2020
 and the date this report is filed
 are as follows:



    
    
Positions
    and Offices Held

    
    
    

Paul
    Adler
    
Director
    President
 Secretary
 Chief Financial Officer


Paul
Adler is the sole executive officer and director of the Company and its majority shareholder.

There
are no agreements or understandings for the officer or director to resign at the request of another person and the above-named
officer and director is not acting on behalf of nor will act at the direction of any other person.

Paul
Adler

President
Secretary
 Chief Financial Officer
 and sole director of the Company.

Mr.
Adler has over a decade of experience in food manufacturing and marketing industries having served as a board member in two food
manufacturing companies. He developed a strong desire to bring healthy beverages and snacks to the market which began after he
saw there were no healthy alternatives. Mr. Adler spent the first decade of his career in the securities industry as a broker/dealer
company in the OSJ Supervisory role where he supervised sixteen registered representatives and was involved in all aspects of
investment banking including public offerings and private placements. In 2008
 Mr. Adler retired from the securities industry
and established Beverage Brands
 a company offering a line of healthy RTD teas and MATE fusion tea. Beverage Brands&rsquo; product
placement reached over 2500 supermarkets in the Northeast and South.

In
2012
 Mr. Adler established Fruttata Brand
 a line of freeze-dried healthy fruit snacks
 under the corporate umbrella of Global
Diversified Holdings
 Inc.
 the subsidiary of the current parent Global Diversified Marketing Group Inc (OTC: GDMK). Since 2012
Mr. Adler had worked with Global Diversified Holdings to continue its development as a manufacturer
 marketer
 and supplier of
unique products. Under Mr. Adler&rsquo;s expertise
 the company has accelerated its product line development and brand additions
to its portfolio in the later part of 2016. The Company has been bootstrapping itself and able to have a significant growth spurt
without any outside capital. Mr. Adler has extensive knowledge of day to day business operations ranging from Wall Street companies
to running a private company and has been successful at establishing long-lasting business relationships throughout his career.



The
Company is authorized to have at least one director but no more than five.

Director
Independence

The
Board of Directors has determined that it does not have any independent directors as that term is defined by NASDAQ Marketplace
Rule 5605(a)(2). In assessing the independence of the directors
 the Board considers any transactions
 relationships
 and arrangements
between our Company and our independent directors or their affiliated companies. This review is based primarily on responses of
the directors to questions in a director and officer questionnaire regarding employment
 business
 familial
 compensation and
other relationships with our Company or our management.

Director
Compensation

Directors
do not receive any compensation for serving on the Board of Directors.

Committees
and Terms

The
Board of Directors has not established any committees.


    
    


Conflicts
of Interest

There
are no binding guidelines or procedures for resolving potential conflicts of interest. Failure by management to resolve conflicts
of interest in favor of the Company could result in liability of management to the Company. However
 any attempt by shareholders
to enforce the liability of management to the Company would most likely be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming.

Corporate
Governance

For
reasons similar to those described above
 the Company does not have a nominating nor audit committee of the board of directors.
At this time
 the Company has only one officer and one director. The Company promotes accountability for adherence to honest and
ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full
 fair
 accurate
 timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that
the Company files and will file with the SEC and in other public communications made by the Company; and strives to be compliant
with applicable governmental laws
 rules
 and regulations. The Company has not formally adopted a written code of business
conduct and ethics that govern the Company&rsquo;s employees
 officers and Directors as the Company is not required to do so.

Instead
of an Audit Committee
 the Company&rsquo;s director is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning the selection
of outside auditors
 reviewing the scope
 results
 and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company&rsquo;s financial statements
and other services provided by the Company&rsquo;s independent public accountants. The Company&rsquo;s director reviews the Company&rsquo;s
internal accounting controls
 practices
 and policies.

Code
of Ethics

The
Company has not at this time adopted a Code of Ethics pursuant to rules described in Regulation S-K. The Company anticipates that
it will adopt a code of ethics when either the number of directors or the number of employees increases development
 execution
and enforcement of such a code would be by the same persons and only persons to whom such code applied.

Officers
and Directors of Global Diversified Holdings
 Inc. (&ldquo;GDHI&rdquo;)

The
Company&rsquo;s operating subsidiary
 GDHI
 has a separate board of directors from the Company which consists of:

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


To
the shareholders and the board of directors of Global Diversified Marketing Group
 Inc.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Global Diversified Marketing Group
 Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;)
as of December 31
 2020 and 2019
 the related statements of operations
 stockholders&rsquo; equity (deficit)
 and cash flows for
the years then ended
 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;financial statements&rdquo;). In our opinion
the financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of December 31
 2020
and 2019
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended
 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

Basis
for Opinion

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company&rsquo;s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error
or fraud. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly
 we express no such opinion.

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to
error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Substantial
Doubt about the Company&rsquo;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the financial statements
 the Company&rsquo;s significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty.

GLOBAL
DIVERSIFIED MARKETING GROUP INC. NOTES
TO
THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER
31
 2020

NOTE
1 &ndash; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature
of Business

Global
Diversified Marketing Group Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;)
 formerly known as Dense Forest Acquisition Corporation
 was incorporated
in Delaware on December 1
 2017
 and changed its name on June 13
 2018
 as part of a change in control. As part of the change
in control
 its then officers and directors resigned and contributed back to the Company 19
500
000 shares of the 20
000
000 outstanding
shares of its common stock
 and appointed new officers and directors. On June 14
 2018
 the new management of the Company issued
12.500
000 shares of its common stock to Paul Adler
 the then president of the Company.

On
November 26
 2018
 the Company effected the acquisition of Global Diversified Holdings
 Inc. (&ldquo;GDHI&rdquo;)
 a private New
York company owned by the Company&rsquo;s president
 with the issuance of 200 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock in exchange
for all of the outstanding shares of GDHI. GDHI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
 and its activity for the years
2020 and 2019 is reflected in these financial statements along with the expenses of the Company.

Prior
to the acquisition of GDHI
 the Company had no business and no operations. Pursuant to the acquisition
 the Company acquired the
operations and business plan of GDHI
 which imports and sells snack food products. For accounting purposes
 GDHI is considered
to be the acquirer
 and the equity is presented as if the business combination had occurred on January 1
 2017.

Basis
of Presentation

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America and are presented in US dollars. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the presentation
in the current year. The Company has adopted a December 31 year-end.

Principles
of Consolidation

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary. All intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The
Company&rsquo;s financial instruments consist of cash
 accounts receivable from customers
 accounts payable
 and loans payable.
The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates
that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of
the balance sheet. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


    
    


Stock-Based
Compensation

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair value method following the guidance outlined in Section 718-10 of
the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosure about Stock-Based Compensation. This Section requires a public entity
to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair
value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required
to provide service in exchange for the award- the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost
is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. During the year ended December 31
2020 and December 31
 2019 stock-based compensation was $168
651 and $-0-
 respectively.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. On
December 31
 2020
 and 2019
 the Company had $62
555 and $22
291 of cash.



The
Company accounts for the transfer of our accounts receivable to a third party under a factoring agreement in accordance with ASC
&rdquo;. ASC 860-10 requires that several conditions be met in order to present
the transfer of accounts receivable as a sale. Even though we have isolated the transferred (sold) assets and we have the legal
right to transfer our assets (accounts receivable) we do not meet the third test of effective control since our accounts receivable
sales agreement with the factor requires us to be liable in the event of default by one of our customers. Because we do not meet
all three conditions
 we do not qualify for sale treatment and our debt incurred with respect to the sale of our accounts receivable
is presented as a loan payable in on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31
 2020 and 2019
 the amounts
due to factors were $20
540 and $98
471 respectively.

Accounts
Receivable

Accounts
receivable are generated from sales of snack food products to retail outlets throughout the United States. The Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based on customer payment and current creditworthiness
as determined by review of their current credit information. The Company continuously monitors credit limits for its customers
and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based on its historical experience and any specific customer issues that
have been identified. An allowance for doubtful; accounts are provided against accounts receivable for amounts management believes
may be uncollectible. The Company historically has not had issues collecting on its accounts receivable from its customers. The
Company factors certain of its receivables to improve its cash flow.

Bad
debt expense for the years ended December 31
 2020
 and 2019 was $5
327 and $0
 respectively; the allowance for doubtful accounts
on December 31
 2020
 and 2019 was $0.



Inventory
consists of snack food products and packaging supplies
 and are stated at the lower of cost or market.

Property
and Equipment

Property
and equipment are stated at cost
 net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful life of the assets. Maintenance
 repairs
 and renewals that do not materially add to the value of the equipment
nor appreciably prolong its useful life are charged to expense as incurred.

Revenue
Recognition

Beginning
January 1
 2018
 the Company implemented ASC 606
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Although the new revenue standard is
expected to have an immaterial impact
 if any
 on our ongoing net income
 we did implement changes to our processes related to
revenue recognition and the control activities within them. These included the development of new policies based on the five-step
model provided in the new revenue standard
 ongoing contract review requirements
 and gathering of information provided for disclosures.


    
    


The
Company recognizes revenue from product sales or services rendered when control of the promised goods are transferred to our clients
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. To achieve
this core principle we apply the following five steps: identify the contract with the client
 identify the performance obligations
in the contract
 determine the transaction price
 allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract and
recognize revenues when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation.

Advertising
and Marketing Costs

The
Company&rsquo;s policy regarding advertising and marketing is to record the expense when incurred. The Company incurred advertising
and marketing expenses of $93
805 and $19
422 during the years ended December 31
 2020
 and 2019
 respectively.

NOTE
1 &ndash; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets

The
Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may
not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present
 the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived
assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows.
If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets
 the Company recognizes an impairment loss
based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower
of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.

Income
Taxes

Income
taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method
 deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and
are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax
assets that
 based on available evidence
 are not expected to be realized.

The
Company&rsquo;s income tax returns are open for examination for up to the past three years under the statute of limitations. There
are no tax returns currently under examination.

Comprehensive
Income

The
Company has established standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income
 its components
 and accumulated balances.
When applicable
 the Company would disclose this information on its Statement of Stockholders&rsquo; Equity. Comprehensive income
comprises equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. During the year ended December
31
 2020 the Company had a balance of $9
892 in accumulated other comprehensive income which arose from unrealized gain due to
foreign currency fluctuations.

Basic
Income (Loss) Per Share

Basic
income (loss) per share has been calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during
the period.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

The
Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company&rsquo;s
results of operations
 financial position
 or cash flow.


    
    


NOTE
2 GOING CONCERN

As
of December 31
 2020
 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $62
555 and had negative stockholders equity of $51
366. Additionally
the Company had negative working capital of $68
612. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability
to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financials have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going
concern and
 accordingly
 do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If the Company
is
 in fact
 unable to continue as a going concern
 the shareholders may lose some or all of their investment in the Company.

NOTE
3 &ndash; CAPITAL STOCK

The
Company has 100
000
000 shares of $.0001 par value common stock authorized. The Company has 13

518 and 13

during the nine months ended December 31

The
Company has 20
000
000 shares of $.0001 par value preferred stock authorized. On February 24

 the Company filed a Certificate
of Designation for a class of preferred stock designated Class A Super Voting Preferred Stock (&ldquo;A Stock&rdquo;). There are
1
000
000 shares of A Stock designated. Each share of such stock shall vote with the common stock and have 100
000 votes. A Stock

 dividend

Chief Executive Officer
 and majority shareholder giving him effective voting control over the Registrant&rsquo;s affairs for

NOTE 1 &#8211; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES




&#8220;Company&#8221;)
 formerly known as Dense Forest Acquisition Corporation
 was incorporated in Delaware on December 1
 2017
and changed its name on June 13
 2018
 as part of a change in control. As part of the change in control
 its then officers and
directors resigned and contributed back to the Company 19
500
000 shares of the 20
000
000 outstanding shares of its common stock
and appointed new officers and directors. On June 14
 2018
 the new management of the Company issued 12.500
000 shares of its common
stock to Paul Adler
 the then president of the Company.


 2018
 the Company effected
the acquisition of Global Diversified Holdings
 Inc. (&#8220;GDHI&#8221;)
 a private New York company owned by the Company&#8217;s
president
 with the issuance of 200 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of
GDHI. GDHI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
 and its activity for the years 2020 and 2019 is reflected in these
financial statements along with the expenses of the Company.


 the Company
had no business and no operations. Pursuant to the acquisition
 the Company acquired the operations and business plan of GDHI
which imports and sells snack food products. For accounting purposes
 GDHI is considered to be the acquirer
 and the equity is
presented as if the business combination had occurred on January 1
 2017.

differ from those estimates.




using the fair value method following the guidance outlined in Section 718-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for
disclosure about Stock-Based Compensation. This Section requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received
in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That
cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award- the
requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees
do not render the requisite service. During the year ended December 31
 2020 and December 31
 2019 stock-based compensation was
$168
651 and $-0-

 the Company had $62

ASC 860-10 requires that several conditions be met in order to present the transfer of accounts receivable as a sale. Even though
we have isolated the transferred (sold) assets and we have the legal right to transfer our assets (accounts receivable) we do not
meet the third test of effective control since our accounts receivable sales agreement with the factor requires us to be liable
in the event of default by one of our customers. Because we do not meet all three conditions
 we do not qualify for sale treatment
and our debt incurred with respect to the sale of our accounts receivable is presented as a loan payable in on our consolidated
balance sheet. As of December 31
 2020 and 2019
 the amounts due to factors were $20
540 and $98
471 respectively.




of snack food products to retail outlets throughout the United States. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers
and adjusts credit limits based on customer payment and current creditworthiness
 as determined by review of their current credit
information. The Company continuously monitors credit limits for its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses
based on its historical experience and any specific customer issues that have been identified. An allowance for doubtful; accounts
are provided against accounts receivable for amounts management believes may be uncollectible. The Company historically has not
had issues collecting on its accounts receivable from its customers. The Company factors certain of its receivables to improve

assets. Maintenance
 repairs
 and renewals that do not materially add to the value of the equipment nor appreciably prolong its
useful life are charged to expense as incurred.




 2018
 the Company implemented
ASC 606
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Although the new revenue standard is expected to have an immaterial impact
 if
any
 on our ongoing net income
 we did implement changes to our processes related to revenue recognition and the control activities
within them. These included the development of new policies based on the five-step model provided in the new revenue standard
ongoing contract review requirements
 and gathering of information provided for disclosures.


sales or services rendered when control of the promised goods are transferred to our clients in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. To achieve this core principle we apply the following
five steps: identify the contract with the client
 identify the performance obligations in the contract
 determine the transaction
price
 allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract and recognize revenues when or as the Company
satisfies a performance obligation.

changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or
changes in circumstances are present
 the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying
value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is
less than the carrying amount of those assets
 the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount
over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value
less costs to sell.




liability method. Under the asset and liability method
 deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted
tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that
 based on available evidence
are not expected to be realized.

&#8220;Company&#8221;)
 formerly known as Dense Forest Acquisition Corporation
 was incorporated in Delaware on December 1
 2017
and changed its name on June 13
 2018
 as part of a change in control. As part of the change in control
 its then officers and
directors resigned and contributed back to the Company 19
500
000 shares of the 20
000
000 outstanding shares of its common stock
and appointed new officers and directors. On June 14
 2018
 the new management of the Company issued 12.500
000 shares of its common
stock to Paul Adler
 the then president of the Company.


 2018
 the Company effected
the acquisition of Global Diversified Holdings
 Inc. (&#8220;GDHI&#8221;)
 a private New York company owned by the Company&#8217;s
president
 with the issuance of 200 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of
GDHI. GDHI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
 and its activity for the years 2020 and 2019 is reflected in these
financial statements along with the expenses of the Company.


 the Company
had no business and no operations. Pursuant to the acquisition
 the Company acquired the operations and business plan of GDHI

 GDHI is considered to be the acquirer
 and the equity is
presented as if the business combination had occurred on January 1
 2017.

using the fair value method following the guidance outlined in Section 718-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for
disclosure about Stock-Based Compensation. This Section requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received
in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That
cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award- the
requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees
do not render the requisite service. During the year ended December 31
 2020 and December 31
 2019 stock-based compensation was
$168

ASC 860-10 requires that several conditions be met in order to present the transfer of accounts receivable as a sale. Even though
we have isolated the transferred (sold) assets and we have the legal right to transfer our assets (accounts receivable) we do not
meet the third test of effective control since our accounts receivable sales agreement with the factor requires us to be liable
in the event of default by one of our customers. Because we do not meet all three conditions
 we do not qualify for sale treatment
and our debt incurred with respect to the sale of our accounts receivable is presented as a loan payable in on our consolidated
balance sheet. As of December 31
 2020 and 2019
 the amounts due to factors were $20
540 and $98

based on its historical experience and any specific customer issues that have been identified. An allowance for doubtful; accounts

useful life are charged to expense as incurred.







 2018
 the Company implemented
ASC 606
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Although the new revenue standard is expected to have an immaterial impact
 if
any

ongoing contract review requirements
 and gathering of information provided for disclosures.


sales or services rendered when control of the promised goods are transferred to our clients in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. To achieve this core principle we apply the following
five steps: identify the contract with the client
 identify the performance obligations in the contract
 determine the transaction
price
 allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract and recognize revenues when or as the Company
satisfies a performance obligation.

changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or
changes in circumstances are present
 the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying
value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is
less than the carrying amount of those assets
 the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount
over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value
less costs to sell.







liability method. Under the asset and liability method
 deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted
tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that
 based on available evidence
are not expected to be realized.
