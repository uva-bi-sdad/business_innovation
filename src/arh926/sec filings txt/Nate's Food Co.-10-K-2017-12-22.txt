 2000 under the name Capital Resources Alliance
 Inc. At inception
 we were a development stage company in the business of mining and exploration. On May 19
 2014 our company completed a reverse merger with Nate&#8217;s Pancakes
 Inc.
 an Indiana company
 with Nate&#8217;s Pancakes being the surviving entity. In May 2014
 we changed our name from Capital Resource Alliance
 Inc. to Nate&#8217;s Food Co.


 we became a food manufacturing and product company
 and in May 2014
 we executed a licensing agreement with Nate&#8217;s Pancakes to market and sell &#8220;Nate&#8217;s Homemade&#8221;
 exclusively throughout the world.


 2017
 our board of directors and a majority of our shareholders approved the filing of Restated Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized shares of common stock of our company from Five Hundred Million (500

 commonly referred to as the JOBS Act. We will remain an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; for up to five years
 or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion
 (ii) the date that we become a &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700&nbsp;million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.

&#8221; which includes issuers that had a public float of less than $ 75 million as of the last business day of their most recently completed second fiscal quarter);
























 Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section&nbsp;7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Under this provision
 an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. In other words
 an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can delay the adoption of such accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies until the first to occur of the date the subject company (i) is no longer an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period provided in Securities Act Section 7(a) (2) (B). Our company has elected to take advantage of this extended transition period and
 as a result
 our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies. Accordingly
 until the date that we are no longer an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; or affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the exemption provided by Securities Act Section 7(a) (2) (B)
 upon the issuance of a new or revised accounting standard that applies to your financial statements and has a different effective date for public and private companies
 clarify that we will disclose the date on which adoption is required for non-emerging growth companies and the date on which we will adopt the recently issued accounting standard.

 and safety of food in the United States. The FDA:









 distribution and manufacturing practices for food ingredients and foods through its current good manufacturing practices regulations and periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to audit compliance;











 including many of the products we sell; and













 the FDA issued a proposed rule that would make significant changes to the information appearing in
 and the format of
 the nutrition facts appearing on food labels. In July 2015
 the FDA issued a supplemental proposed rule to establish a reference value for added sugars and to require a declaration of the percent daily value of added sugars on the food label. The proposed rule would also revise the footnote in the nutrition label regarding the percent daily value. It is not clear whether FDA will issue final regulation or
 if it does
 how much time FDA will give food manufactures to bring their labels into compliance.


 the FDA enforces the Public Health Service Act and regulations issued thereunder
 which authorizes regulatory activity necessary to prevent the introduction
 transmission
 or spread of communicable diseases. These regulations require
 for example
 pasteurization of milk and milk products. The FDA also is implementing the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 (FSMA) which
 among other things
 mandates that the FDA adopt preventive controls to be implemented by farms
 warehouses
 food facilities and transporters in order to minimize or prevent hazards to food safety.&nbsp;


 FDA released final rules implementing the Produce Safety and Current Good Manufacturing Practices
 Hazard Analysis and Risk Based Preventive Controls (HARPC) requirements for human food and animal food
 which was a major milestone in the implementation of FSMA. The final rules revise the FDA&#8217;s food safety regulations by: (1)&nbsp;codifying good agricultural practices and water fertilizer action limits
 (2) updating and revising certain requirements in the existing current good manufacturing practices regulations (current 21 CFR Part 110)
 (3) requiring the establishment and implementation of a food safety system that includes an analysis of hazards and risk-based preventive controls and sets requirements for a written food safety plan
 and (4) adding new requirements for a risk-based end-to-end supply chain program. Compliance is required by September 19
 2016
 with respect to the new good manufacturing practices and HARPC regulations
 and by January 2017
 with respect to the new produce safety rules.

 the FDA has authority to review product labeling

 which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However
 our company has negative working capital

 and does not have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs. These factors raise substantial doubt about our company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern.















 our company&#8217;s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of our business
 maintaining our good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
 and the payment of expenses associated with operations and business developments. Our company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital.


 we have mostly relied upon internally generated funds such as shareholder loans and advances to finance our operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital by retaining net earnings or through future public or private offerings of our company&#8217;s stock or through loans from private investors
 although there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing. Our company&#8217;s failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon us and our shareholders.


 which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis
 management evaluates its estimates and judgments
 including those related to revenue recognition
 accrued expenses
 financing operations
 and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates as to the appropriate carrying value of certain assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources.

 we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining

 which requires the measurement of the cost of services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation cost is recognized over the estimated service period (generally the vesting period) on the straight-line method. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of options granted.


 &#8220;Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees&#8221; (&#8220;Topic No. 505-50&#8221;). Topic No. 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued
 whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued to non-employees is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance to earn the equity instruments is reached (a &#8220;performance commitment&#8221; which would include a penalty considered to be of a magnitude that is a sufficiently large disincentive for nonperformance) or (ii) the date at which performance is complete.

 the Company has generated $4
486 and $0 in revenue from third parties and $0 and 29
250 in revenue from a related party
 respectively. 















 &#8220;Accounting for Income Taxes.&#8221; Under this method
 income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year; and
 (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity&#8217;s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence
 it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.


 a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken may be recognized only if it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that the position is sustainable upon examination
 based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all the relevant information. A liability (including interest and penalties
 if applicable) is established to the extent a current benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain tax position. Related interest and penalties
 if any
 are included as components of income tax expense and income taxes payable.

 Fair Value Measurements (ASC Topic 820)
 which defines fair value
 establishes a framework for measuring fair value
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard provides a consistent definition of fair value which focuses on an exit price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard also prioritizes
 within the measurement of fair value
 the use of market-based information over entity specific information and establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based on the nature of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.

. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method for outstanding warrants and options and using the if-converted method for convertible debt and convertible preferred stock. In computing diluted EPS
 the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.

 2017
 the end of our fiscal year covered by this report
 we carried out an evaluation
 under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer (our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (our principal financial officer and principle accounting officer)
 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing
 our chief executive officer (our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (our principal financial officer and principle accounting officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.




 estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of control procedures. The objectives of internal control include providing management with reasonable
 but not absolute
 assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition
 and that transactions are executed in accordance with management&#8217;s authorization and recorded properly to permit the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

 2017:

: Our company does not have any independent directors. We intend to obtain at least two independent directors during the year ended May 31
 2018. The cost associated to the addition is minimal and not deemed material.












:&nbsp;Ineffective controls over financial reporting: Our company intends to hire additional staff members
 either as employees or consultants
&nbsp;prior to May 31
 2018. These additional staff members will be responsible for making sure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed and submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported as and when required and will the staff members will have segregated responsibilities with regard to these responsibilities. The costs associated with the hiring the additional staff members will increase our company's sales
 general and administration (SG&amp;A) expense. It is anticipated the cost of the new staff members will be approximately $60
000 per year. As of May 31
 2017
 we have no full-time employees with the requisite expertise in the key functional areas of finance and accounting. As a result
 there is a lack of proper segregation of duties necessary to insure that all transactions are accounted for accurately and in a timely manner.

: Should at least two independent directors be appointed
 our company expects that an Audit Committee will be established. The cost associated to the addition an audit committee is minimal and not deemed material.

: We need to prepare written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting to establish a formal process to close our books monthly on an accrual basis and account for all transactions
 including equity transactions

 2017
 our company has not taken any remediation actions to address these weaknesses in our controls even though they were identified during the year. Our company&#8217;s management expects
 once it is in the financial position to do so
 to hire additional staff in our accounting department to be able to segregate the duties. Our company expects that the expense will be approximately $60

 and personnel factors. Internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis
 however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce
 though not eliminate
 this risk. Therefore
 even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 &amp;#147;Accounting for&#13;Income Taxes.&amp;#148; Under this method
 income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for&#13;the current year; and
 (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized&#13;in an entity&amp;#146;s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates&#13;expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.&#13;The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period&#13;that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the&#13;weight of available positive and negative evidence

 a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected&#13;to be taken may be recognized only if it is &amp;#147;more likely than not&amp;#148; that the position is sustainable upon examination
&#13;based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax&#13;benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge&#13;of all the relevant information. A liability (including interest and penalties
 if applicable) is established to the extent a&#13;current benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain&#13;tax position. Related interest and penalties

 &amp;#147;Accounting for&#13;Income Taxes.&amp;#148; Under this method
 income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for&#13;the current year; and
 (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized&#13;in an entity&amp;#146;s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates&#13;expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.&#13;The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period&#13;that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the&#13;weight of available positive and negative evidence

 a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected&#13;to be taken may be recognized only if it is &amp;#147;more likely than not&amp;#148; that the position is sustainable upon examination
&#13;based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax&#13;benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge&#13;of all the relevant information. A liability (including interest and penalties
 if applicable) is established to the extent a&#13;current benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain&#13;tax position. Related interest and penalties
 if any

 Fair Value Measurements (&amp;#34;ASC Topic 820&amp;#34;)
 which defines fair value
 establishes a framework&#13;for measuring fair value
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard provides a consistent definition&#13;of fair value which focuses on an exit price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an&#13;orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard also prioritizes
 within the measurement&#13;of fair value

 and&#13;inputs that are observable for the asset or liability other than quoted prices

Organization
and Nature of Business

Nate&#146;s
Food Co. (&#147;we&#148;
 &#147;us&#148;
 &#147;our&#148;
 the &#34;Company&#34; or the &#34;Registrant&#34;) was incorporated
in the state of Colorado on January 12
 2000. Nate&#146;s Food Co. is domiciled in the state of Colorado
 and its corporate headquarters
are located in Huntington Beach
 California. The Company selected May 31 as its fiscal year end. On May 12
 2014
 Nate&#146;s
Pancakes Inc. was incorporated in the state of Indiana. On May 19
 2014
 the Company completed a reverse merger between with Nate&#146;s
Pancakes
 Inc. Nate&#146;s Pancakes was the surviving Company. In May 2014
 the Company changed its name from Capital Resource
Alliance to Nate&#146;s Food Co.

We
sell a ready-to-use
 pre-mixed pancake and waffle batter delivered in a pressurized can. Our current product is an original flavor
of pancake and waffle batter. We are currently in the process of developing additional flavors and products with the goal to have
10 products in development in 2017. Currently
 we have developed three flavors for our pancake and waffle mix. We plan to continue
to expand into other baked goods and other non-breakfast areas.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. A change in managements&#146; estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on Nate&#146;s Food Co. financial
condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Nate&#146;s Food Co.&#146;s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair
presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows
 the Company considers all short-term marketable securities purchased with maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Share-Based
Compensation

The
Company applies Topic 718 &#147;Share-Based Payments&#148; (&#147;Topic 718&#148;) to share-based compensation
 which requires
the measurement of the cost of services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair
value of the award. Compensation cost is recognized over the estimated service period (generally the vesting period) on the straight-line
method. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of options granted.

The
Company accounts for equity-based transactions with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50
 &#147;Equity-Based
Payments to Non-Employees&#148; (&#147;Topic No. 505-50&#148;). Topic No. 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions
with non-employees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments
issued
 whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued to non-employees
is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance to earn the equity instruments is reached (a
&#147;performance commitment&#148; which would include a penalty considered to be of a magnitude that is a sufficiently large
disincentive for nonperformance) or (ii) the date at which performance is complete.

Revenue
Recognition

It
is the Company&#146;s policy that revenues and gains will be recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 605-10-25
 &#147;Revenue
Recognition.&#148; Under ASC Topic 605-10-25
 revenue earning activities are recognized upon the sale and delivery of its products.
For the years ended May 31
 2017
 and 2016
 the Company has generated $4
486 and $0 in revenue from third parties and $0 and 29
250
in revenue from a related party
 respectively.

Income
Taxes

The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10
 &#147;Accounting for
Income Taxes.&#148; Under this method
 income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for
the current year; and
 (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized
in an entity&#146;s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period
that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the
weight of available positive and negative evidence
 it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized.

ASC
740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10
 a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected
to be taken may be recognized only if it is &#147;more likely than not&#148; that the position is sustainable upon examination
based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax
benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge
of all the relevant information. A liability (including interest and penalties
 if applicable) is established to the extent a
current benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain
tax position. Related interest and penalties
 if any
 are included as components of income tax expense and income taxes payable.

Research
and Development

We
employ processes at our principal manufacturing locations that emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product
improvement and quality control. In addition
 we conduct research activities related to the development of new products. Research
and development expense was $1
532 and $1
850 in fiscal 2017 and 2016
 respectively.

Long-Lived
Assets

Long-lived
assets such as property and equipment are stated at their fair value acquisition cost and reviewed for impairment whenever facts
and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Amortization of long-lived assets are calculated by
the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. When required impairment losses on assets to be held and used are
recognized based on the fair value of the asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows
 market
value of similar assets
 if available
 or independent appraisals
 if required. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset
is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows
 an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying
amount and fair value of the asset. When fair values are not available
 the Company estimates fair value using the expected future
cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the recovery of the assets.

Depreciation
is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated
useful lives of depreciable assets are:



    
    
    

    
    
Useful
    Lives

    
    
5-10
    years


For
federal income tax purposes
 depreciation is computed under the modified accelerated cost recovery system. For financial statements
purposes
 depreciation is computed under the straight-line method.

We
completed an impairment evaluation of equipment at May 31
 2017
 and recognized an impairment loss of $355
675 and $0 during the
years ended May 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The
Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash
 accounts payable and accrued liabilities
 accrued expenses
 convertible
notes and notes payable. The carrying amounts of such financial instruments approximate their respective estimated fair value
due to the short-term maturities and approximate market interest rates of these instruments.

The
Company adopted ASC Topic 820
 Fair Value Measurements (&#34;ASC Topic 820&#34;)
 which defines fair value
 establishes a framework
for measuring fair value
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard provides a consistent definition
of fair value which focuses on an exit price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard also prioritizes
 within the measurement
of fair value
 the use of market-based information over entity specific information and establishes a three-level hierarchy for
fair value measurements based on the nature of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.

The
three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements is defined as follows:

Level
1 &#150; inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;
liabilities in active markets;

Level
2 &#150; inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets
 and
inputs that are observable for the asset or liability other than quoted prices
 either directly or indirectly
 including inputs
in markets that are not considered to be active; or directly or indirectly including inputs in markets that are not considered
to be active;

Level
3 &#150; inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement

The
following table summarizes fair value measurements by level at May 31
 2017
 and 2016
 measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

Basic
Earnings (Loss) Per Share

The
Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) 260

per Share
statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average
number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares
outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method for outstanding warrants and options and using the if-converted
method for convertible debt and convertible preferred stock. In computing diluted EPS
 the average stock price for the period
is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS
excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.

For
the years ended May 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively
 the following warrants
 convertible notes and convertible preferred stock
were potentially dilutive.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In
September 2017
 the FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2017-13
 &#147;Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)
 Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
 Leases (Topic 840)
 and Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to
the Staff Announcement at the July 20
 2017 EITF Meeting and Rescission of Prior SEC Staff Announcements and Observer Comments.&#148;
The amendments in ASU No. 2017-13 amends the early adoption date option for certain companies related to the adoption of ASU No.
2014-09 and ASU No. 2016-02. Both of the below entities may still adopt using the public company adoption guidance in the related
ASUs
 as amended. The effective date is the same as the effective date and transition requirements for the amendments for ASU
2014-09 and ASU 2016-02.

In
May 2014
 the FASB issued an accounting standards update which modifies the requirements for identifying
 allocating
 and recognizing
revenue related to the achievement of performance conditions under contracts with customers. This update also requires additional
disclosure related to the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized under contracts with customers.
This guidance is effective&#160;for fiscal and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017 and is required to be applied
retrospectively to all revenue arrangements. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the
Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements.

In December 2016
 the FASB has
issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-20
 &#147;Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606
 Revenue from
Contracts with Customers.&#148; The amendments affect narrow aspects of the guidance issued in ASU 2014-09 including Loan Guarantee
Fees
 Contract Costs
 Provisions for Losses on Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts
 Disclosure of Remaining Performance
Obligations
 Disclosure of Prior Period Performance Obligations
 Contract Modifications
 Contract Asset vs. Receivable
 Refund
Liability
 Advertising Costs
 Fixed Odds Wagering Contracts in the Casino Industry
 and Costs Capitalized for Advisors to Private
Funds and Public Funds. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective date and
transition requirements for FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606. Public entities should apply Topic 606 (and related
amendments) for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 including interim reporting periods therein.

The
Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable
to a going concern
 which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
However
 the Company has negative working capital
 recurring losses
 and does not have an established source of revenues sufficient
to cover its operating costs. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern.

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described
in the succeeding paragraphs and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include
any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
&#160;
&#160;
In
the coming year
 the Company&#146;s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its
business
 maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
 and the
payment of expenses associated with operations and business developments. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required
to raise additional capital.

Historically
it has mostly relied upon internally generated funds such as shareholder loans and advances to finance its operations and growth.
Management may raise additional capital by retaining net earnings or through future public or private offerings of the Company&#146;s
stock or through loans from private investors
 although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing.
The Company&#146;s failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders.



































The entire disclosure when substantial doubt is raised about the ability to continue as a going concern. Includes
 but is not limited to
 principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern
 management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the ability to meet its obligations
 and management's plans that alleviated or are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern.

Aggregate
intrinsic value is the sum of the amounts by which the quoted market price of the Company's stock exceeded the exercise price
of the warrants at May 31
 2017
 for those warrants for which the quoted market price was in excess of the exercise price (&#34;in-the-money&#34;
warrants). As of May 31
 2017
 the aggregate intrinsic value of warrants outstanding was approximately $8
310 based on the closing
market price of $0.0012 on May 31
 2017.

The Company determined that the
warrants qualify for derivative accounting (see note 6).

We
did not provide any current or deferred U.S. federal income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because
we have experienced operating losses since inception. When it is more likely than not that a tax asset cannot be realized through
future income the Company must allow for this future tax benefit. We provided a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax
asset
 consisting of net operating loss carry forwards
 because management has determined that it is more likely than not that
we will not earn income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets during the carry forward period.

The
Company has not taken a tax position that
 if challenged
 would have a material effect on the financial statements for the years
ended May 31
 2017 and 2016 as applicable under FASB ASC 740. We did not recognize any adjustment to the liability for uncertain
tax position and therefore did not record any adjustment to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit on the balance sheet.
All tax returns for the Company remain open.
&#160;&#160;
&#160;
The
provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before
provision for income taxes. The sources and tax effects of the differences for the periods presented are as follows:

Nate&#146;s
Food Co. (&#147;we&#148;
 &#147;us&#148;
 &#147;our&#148;
 the &#34;Company&#34; or the &#34;Registrant&#34;) was incorporated
in the state of Colorado on January 12
 2000. Nate&#146;s Food Co. is domiciled in the state of Colorado
 and its corporate headquarters
are located in Huntington Beach
 California. The Company selected May 31 as its fiscal year end. On May 12
 2014
 Nate&#146;s
Pancakes Inc. was incorporated in the state of Indiana. On May 19
 2014
 the Company completed a reverse merger between with Nate&#146;s
Pancakes
 Inc. Nate&#146;s Pancakes was the surviving Company. In May 2014
 the Company changed its name from Capital Resource
Alliance to Nate&#146;s Food Co.

We
sell a ready-to-use
 pre-mixed pancake and waffle batter delivered in a pressurized can. Our current product is an original flavor
of pancake and waffle batter. We are currently in the process of developing additional flavors and products with the goal to have
10 products in development in 2017. Currently
 we have developed three flavors for our pancake and waffle mix. We plan to continue
to expand into other baked goods and other non-breakfast areas.





The
preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. A change in managements&#146; estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on Nate&#146;s Food Co. financial
condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Nate&#146;s Food Co.&#146;s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair
presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.





For
purposes of the statement of cash flows
 the Company considers all short-term marketable securities purchased with maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.





The
Company applies Topic 718 &#147;Share-Based Payments&#148; (&#147;Topic 718&#148;) to share-based compensation
 which requires
the measurement of the cost of services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair
value of the award. Compensation cost is recognized over the estimated service period (generally the vesting period) on the straight-line
method. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of options granted.

The
Company accounts for equity-based transactions with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50
 &#147;Equity-Based
Payments to Non-Employees&#148; (&#147;Topic No. 505-50&#148;). Topic No. 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions
with non-employees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments
issued
 whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued to non-employees
is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance to earn the equity instruments is reached (a
&#147;performance commitment&#148; which would include a penalty considered to be of a magnitude that is a sufficiently large
disincentive for nonperformance) or (ii) the date at which performance is complete.






It
is the Company&#146;s policy that revenues and gains will be recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 605-10-25
 &#147;Revenue
Recognition.&#148; Under ASC Topic 605-10-25
 revenue earning activities are recognized upon the sale and delivery of its products.
For the years ended May 31
 2017
 and 2016
 the Company has generated $4
486 and $0 in revenue from third parties and $0 and 29
250
in revenue from a related party
 respectively.





The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10
 &#147;Accounting for
Income Taxes.&#148; Under this method
 income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for
the current year; and
 (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized
in an entity&#146;s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period
that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the
weight of available positive and negative evidence
 it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized.

ASC
740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10
 a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected
to be taken may be recognized only if it is &#147;more likely than not&#148; that the position is sustainable upon examination
based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax
benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge
of all the relevant information. A liability (including interest and penalties
 if applicable) is established to the extent a
current benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain
tax position. Related interest and penalties
 if any
 are included as components of income tax expense and income taxes payable.





We
employ processes at our principal manufacturing locations that emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product
improvement and quality control. In addition
 we conduct research activities related to the development of new products. Research
and development expense was $1
532 and $1
850 in fiscal 2017 and 2016
 respectively.





Long-lived
assets such as property and equipment are stated at their fair value acquisition cost and reviewed for impairment whenever facts
and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Amortization of long-lived assets are calculated by
the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. When required impairment losses on assets to be held and used are
recognized based on the fair value of the asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows
 market
value of similar assets
 if available
 or independent appraisals
 if required. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset
is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows
 an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying
amount and fair value of the asset. When fair values are not available
 the Company estimates fair value using the expected future
cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the recovery of the assets.

Depreciation
is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated
useful lives of depreciable assets are:



    
    
    

    
    
Useful
    Lives

    
    
5-10
    years


For
federal income tax purposes
 depreciation is computed under the modified accelerated cost recovery system. For financial statements
purposes
 depreciation is computed under the straight-line method.

We
completed an impairment evaluation of equipment at May 31
 2017
 and recognized an impairment loss of $355
675 and $0 during the
years ended May 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively.






The
Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash
 accounts payable and accrued
liabilities
 accrued expenses
 convertible notes and notes payable. The carrying amounts of such financial instruments approximate
their respective estimated fair value due to the short-term maturities and approximate market interest rates of these instruments.

The
Company adopted ASC Topic 820
 Fair Value Measurements (&#34;ASC Topic 820&#34;)
 which defines fair value
 establishes a framework
for measuring fair value
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard provides a consistent definition
of fair value which focuses on an exit price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard also prioritizes
 within the measurement
of fair value
 the use of market-based information over entity specific information and establishes a three-level hierarchy for
fair value measurements based on the nature of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.

The
three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements is defined as follows:

Level
1 &#150; inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;
liabilities in active markets;

Level
2 &#150; inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets
 and
inputs that are observable for the asset or liability other than quoted prices
 either directly or indirectly
 including inputs
in markets that are not considered to be active; or directly or indirectly including inputs in markets that are not considered
to be active;

Level
3 &#150; inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement

The
following table summarizes fair value measurements by level at May 31

The
Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) 260

per Share
statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average
number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares
outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method for outstanding warrants and options and using the if-converted
method for convertible debt and convertible preferred stock. In computing diluted EPS
 the average stock price for the period
is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS
excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.

For
the years ended May 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively
 the following warrants
 convertible notes and convertible preferred stock
were potentially dilutive.

For the year ended May 31

the warrants
 convertible notes and convertible preferred stock that were potentially dilutive
 were excluded from the computation
of diluted net loss per shares as the result of the computation was anti-dilutive:





In
September 2017
 the FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2017-13
 &#147;Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)
 Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
 Leases (Topic 840)
 and Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to
the Staff Announcement at the July 20
 2017 EITF Meeting and Rescission of Prior SEC Staff Announcements and Observer Comments.&#148;
The amendments in ASU No. 2017-13 amends the early adoption date option for certain companies related to the adoption of ASU No.
2014-09 and ASU No. 2016-02. Both of the below entities may still adopt using the public company adoption guidance in the related
ASUs
 as amended. The effective date is the same as the effective date and transition requirements for the amendments for ASU
2014-09 and ASU 2016-02.

In
May 2014
 the FASB issued an accounting standards update which modifies the requirements for identifying
 allocating
 and recognizing
revenue related to the achievement of performance conditions under contracts with customers. This update also requires additional
disclosure related to the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized under contracts with customers.
This guidance is effective&#160;for fiscal and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017 and is required to be applied
retrospectively to all revenue arrangements. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the
Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements.

In
December 2016
 the FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-20
 &#147;Technical Corrections and Improvements
to Topic 606
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.&#148; The amendments affect narrow aspects of the guidance issued in ASU
2014-09 including Loan Guarantee Fees
 Contract Costs
 Provisions for Losses on Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts
Disclosure of Remaining Performance Obligations
 Disclosure of Prior Period Performance Obligations
 Contract Modifications
 Contract
Asset vs. Receivable
 Refund Liability
 Advertising Costs
 Fixed Odds Wagering Contracts in the Casino Industry
 and Costs Capitalized
for Advisors to Private Funds and Public Funds. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same
as the effective date and transition requirements for FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606. Public entities should
apply Topic 606 (and related amendments) for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 including interim reporting
periods therein.

 including the policy for determining which items are treated as cash equivalents. Other information that may be disclosed includes (1) the nature of any restrictions on the entity's use of its cash and cash equivalents
 (2) whether the entity's cash and cash equivalents are insured or expose the entity to credit risk
 (3) the classification of any negative balance accounts (overdrafts)
 and (4) the carrying basis of cash equivalents (for example
 at cost) and whether the carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value.




























Disclosure of accounting policy for computing basic and diluted earnings or loss per share for each class of common stock and participating security. Addresses all significant policy factors
 including any antidilutive items that have been excluded from the computation and takes into account stock dividends
 splits and reverse splits that occur after the balance sheet date of the latest reporting period but before the issuance of the financial statements.

 delivery of multiple products
 services or the rights to use assets) the disclosure may indicate the accounting policy for each unit of accounting as well as how units of accounting are determined and valued. The disclosure may encompass important judgment as to appropriateness of principles related to recognition of revenue. The disclosure also may indicate the entity's treatment of any unearned or deferred revenue that arises from the transaction.

Tabular disclosure of warrants or rights issued. Warrants and rights outstanding are derivative securities that give the holder the right to purchase securities (usually equity) from the issuer at a specific price within a certain time frame. Warrants are often included in a new debt issue to entice investors by a higher return potential. The main difference between warrants and call options is that warrants are issued and guaranteed by the company
 whereas options are exchange instruments and are not issued by the company. Also
 the lifetime of a warrant is often measured in years
 while the lifetime of a typical option is measured in months. Disclose the title of issue of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the aggregate amount of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the date from which the warrants or rights are exercisable
 and the price at which the warrant or right is exercisable.
