        outstanding immediately prior to the acquisition. We closed the acquisition on May 6

 the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (as amended
 the &#8220;Halo Agreement&#8221;) with Halo
 Thriving Paws
 LLC
 a Delaware limited liability company (&#8220;Thriving Paws&#8221;)
 HH-Halo LP
 a Delaware
        limited partnership (&#8220;HH-Halo&#8221; and
 together with Thriving Paws
 the &#8220;Sellers&#8221;) and HH-Halo
 in the capacity of the representative of the Sellers. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Halo Agreement
 among other things
 we
        agreed to purchase from the Sellers one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Halo in the Halo Acquisition. The aggregate consideration payable by us under the Halo Agreement was $38.2 million
 subject to customary
        adjustments for Halo&#8217;s net working capital
 cash
 and indebtedness
 and consisted of a combination of (i) cash
 (ii) shares of our common stock
 par value $0.001 per share
 and (iii) convertible subordinated notes and accompanying stock purchase
        warrants. The Halo Acquisition was consummated on December 19

      
      
      
Better Choice Company is a rapidly growing animal health and wellness company committed to leading the industry shift toward pet products and services that help dogs and cats live
          heathier
 happier and longer lives. We take an alternative
 nutrition-based approach to animal health relative to conventional dog and cat food offerings
 and position our portfolio of brands to benefit from the mainstream trends of growing pet
          humanization and consumer focus on health and wellness. We have a demonstrated
 multi-decade track record of success selling trusted animal health and wellness products
 and leverage our established digital footprint to provide pet parents with

 cat food and treats under the Halo and TruDog brands
 which are focused
 respectively
 on providing sustainably sourced kibble and
        canned food derived from real whole meat
 and minimally processed raw-diet dog food and treats
      
        

        

          
        


 which we believe provides us with broad demographic exposure and appeal. We group these channels of trade into two distinct
        categories: retail-partner based (&#8220;Retail&#8221;)
 which includes the sale of product to e-commerce retailers
 pet specialty chains
 grocery
 mass and distributors
 and direct to consumer
 (&#8220;DTC&#8221;)
 which is focused on driving consumers to directly
        purchase product through our online web platform. With regard to our channels of trade
 the online purchase of pet food continues to take market share from brick and mortar retail
 with Packaged Facts reporting internet shopping growing from 7% of
        U.S. pet product sales in 2015 to 22% in 2019. We believe that the trend toward online shopping will continue
 and we will continue to reach a growing base of diverse customers through our DTC and e-commerce partner channels. Because our DTC
        strategy leverages one-on-one customer relationships and utilizes a targeted
 data-driven approach to reach customers
 we can gather valuable market and consumer behavior data that will allow our brands to be more competitive in the Retail channel.
        Conversely
 we believe Halo&#8217;s long-established relationships with key Retail customers will enable us to more effectively launch additional brands in the rapidly evolving retail environment. In addition
 Halo has successfully launched into high

      

 manufacture and commercialize new products generally in under 12 weeks. We will continue to deliver innovation to expand our
        product offerings and improve the health and well-being of pets. We leverage our proprietary behavioral database
 customer feedback and analytics capabilities to derive valuable insights and launch new products. We recently launched a line
        extension of our Halo brand to offer vegan alternatives for our customers. In addition to our domestic capabilities
 we have partnered with a leading Israeli research and development center

 we believe that the traditional retail environment is currently undergoing

 we have
        partnered with key e-commerce retailers in our Retail channel and adopted a robust DTC sales model that is anchored by an e-commerce website whereby we educate
 sell and ship our various products directly to consumers. Our DTC model has allowed us
        to drive new consumers directly to our brands and develop a recurring revenue model. In addition
 our e-commerce retail partners offer incentives to drive monthly subscriptions

 we face fragmented competition due to the infancy of the pet-related CBD market. Given the rapid growth of the U.S. CBD industry

 most CBD companies focus on the human CBD market. Our competitors within the pet CBD market include: Therabis

 including animal foods

 is complex

 the FTC
 the USDA and other regulatory authorities at the federal

 extensively regulate

 the research

 composition
        manufacture

 and post-market reporting of animal foods
 including those that contain CBD. We
 along with our third-party contractors
 are required to navigate a complex
        regulatory framework in the countries in which we wish to manufacture

 state and local regulations regarding animal foods containing CBD are evolving
 and we continue to monitor those developments. However
 we cannot predict the timing

        of any new or revised state

      
      
      

 the DEA regulated CBD pursuant to the Controlled Substances Act (&#8220;CSA&#8221;)
 which establishes a framework of controls over certain substances depending on whether they are classified in one of five
        risk-based schedules. Schedule I substances are the most stringently controlled
 as they have been determined to have a high potential for abuse
 there are no currently accepted medical uses in the U.S.
 and there is a lack of accepted safety for
        use of the substance under medical supervision. The CSA classifies &#8220;marihuana&#8221; as a Schedule I controlled substance and previously defined &#8220;marihuana&#8221; to include all parts of the cannabis plant
 whether growing or not; the seeds of the plant; the
        resin extracted from any part of the plant; and every compound mixture
 salt
 derivative
 mixture
 or preparation of the plant
 its seeds
 or its resin (with a few exceptions
 such as mature stalks of the plant and seeds incapable of germination).
        Pursuant to this definition

      

 Congress enacted the Agricultural Act of 2014 (&#8220;2014 Farm Bill&#8221;) to allow for the limited growth and cultivation of industrial hemp
 which was defined as including all parts of the cannabis plant
        whether growing or not
 with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (&#8220;THC&#8221;) concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis. This statute also allowed
 as permitted by state law
 growing and cultivating industrial hemp under the auspices

      

 Congress enacted the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (&#8220;2018 Farm Bill&#8221;) to more broadly allow for the production of hemp pursuant to state and tribal plans overseen by the USDA. The 2018 Farm Bill
        amended the statutory definition of &#8220;marihuana&#8221; under the CSA to specifically exclude &#8220;hemp
&#8221; which is defined as any part of the cannabis plant
 including the seeds thereof and all derivatives
 extracts
 cannabinoids
 isomers
 acids
 salts
 and
        salts of isomers
 whether growing or not
 with a delta-9 THC concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis. Under this definition
 as long as CBD meets the statutory definition of &#8220;hemp
&#8221; then it is no longer a Schedule I
        controlled substance under the CSA. However
 the 2018 Farm Bill did not modify the Federal Food
 Drug
 and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FDCA&#8221;) and specifically preserved the FDA&#8217;s authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds
        such as CBD

      


        

          
        


 states and Indian tribes may submit to the USDA through the state department of agriculture a plan under which the state or Indian tribe will monitor and regulate the production of
        industrial hemp. For those states that do not have an approved state plan
 the production of hemp will be subject to a USDA-established plan
 although states retain the ability to prohibit hemp production within their borders.&#160; On October 31
 2019
        the USDA issued an interim final rule (the &#8220;IFR&#8221;) to implement the 2018 Farm Bill
 which established the required regulatory framework governing commercial hemp production in the United States. The USDA has begun reviewing hemp production plans
        submitted by state and tribal governments
 although several states have informed the USDA that they will continue to operate under their 2014 Farm Bill pilot programs for the time being. Pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill
 the 2014 Farm Bill will
        remain effective until one year after the date of publication of the IFR
 or October 31
 2020. In addition
 no state or Indian tribe may prohibit the transportation or shipment of hemp or hemp products produced in accordance with the 2018 Farm Bill
        through the state or territory

      
      
      


 including foods intended for animals
 under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. The FDCA defines &#8220;food&#8221; as articles used for food or drink for man or other animals
 which
        includes products that are intended primarily for nutritional use
 taste
 or aroma and the components of such products. For animal foods in particular
 this definition applies based on their intended use regardless of labelling as animal food
        treats
 or supplements. The FDA also imposes certain requirements on animal foods relating to their composition
 manufacturing
 labeling
 and marketing. Among other things
 the facilities in which our products and ingredients are manufactured must
        register with the FDA

      

 any substance that is added to or is expected to become a component of a pet food must be used in accordance with a food
        additive regulation
 unless it is generally recognized as safe (&#8220;GRAS&#8221;) under the conditions of its intended use or if it appears on an FDA-recognized list of acceptable animal food ingredients in the Official Publication of AAFCO. A food may be
        adulterated if it uses an ingredient that is neither GRAS nor an approved food additive
 and that food may not be legally marketed in the United States. FDA has confirmed that the use of cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds in animal food
        products is subject to these food additive requirements. At this time
 there are no approved food additive petitions or regulations for any cannabis-derived food additive
 and while the FDA has issued a &#8220;no questions&#8221; response to certain GRAS
        notifications for hemp seed products

      

 the FDCA prohibits the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that contains an approved drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been
        instituted and made public (unless certain exceptions apply). Under this prohibition
 the FDA has stated that animal foods containing CBD are adulterated because CBD is an active ingredient in an FDA-approved drug that was the subject of
        substantial clinical investigations before it was marketed as a food

      

        enforcement action against marketers of certain CBD products (some in collaboration with the FTC)
 the FDA is in the process of evaluating its regulatory approach to products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds. The FDA has formed an
        internal working group to evaluate the issue and on May 31
 2019 held a public hearing to obtain scientific data and information about the safety
 manufacturing
 product quality
 marketing
 labeling
 and sale of products containing cannabis or
        cannabis-derived compounds. The hearing featured extensive discussion from a variety of stakeholders regarding the use of hemp and CBD in FDA-regulated products
 including pet foods. At the hearing
 FDA stated that while it does not have a policy
        of enforcement discretion with respect to any CBD products
 the agency&#8217;s biggest concern is the marketing of products that put the health and safety of consumers at risk
 such as those claiming to prevent
 diagnose
 mitigate
 treat
 or cure serious

      

 on March 5
 2020
 the FDA issued a report to Congress required under the 2018 Farm Bill in which the agency announced that it is currently evaluating a risk-based enforcement policy for CBD to
        provide more clarity to industry and the public while the agency takes potential steps to establish a clear regulatory pathway. Although it is unclear whether or when the FDA will ultimately issue such an enforcement policy
 the agency reemphasized
        that it will continue to take action against unlawful CBD products that pose a risk of harm to the public
 including products with therapeutic claims; products that include contaminants such as heavy metals
 THC
 and other harmful substances;
        products associated with false statements
 such as omitted ingredients and incorrect statements about the about of CBD; and products marketed to vulnerable populations

      


        

          
        


 a net quantity statement
 a statement of the name
        and place of business of the manufacturer or distributor and proper listing of all the ingredients in order of predominance by weight. The FDA also considers certain specific claims on pet food labels to be medical claims and therefore subject to
        prior review and approval by the FDA. For example
 pet food products that are labeled or marketed with claims that may suggest that they are intended to treat or prevent a specific disease in pets would potentially meet the statutory definitions of
        both a food and a drug. The FDA recently issued guidance containing a list of specific factors it will consider in determining whether to initiate enforcement action against such products if they do not comply with the regulatory requirements
        applicable to drugs
 including
 among other things
 whether the product is only made available through or under the direction of a veterinarian and does not present a known safety risk when used as labeled. The FDA may classify some of our products

      

 the FDA may require the recall of an animal food product if there is a reasonable probability that the product is adulterated or misbranded
 and the use of or exposure to the product
        will cause serious adverse health consequences or death. In addition
 pet food manufacturers may voluntarily recall or withdraw their products from the market. If the FDA believes that our products are adulterated
 misbranded or otherwise marketed
        in violation of the FDCA
 the agency make take further enforcement action

 a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan
 China. In January 2020
 the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a &#8220;Public Health Emergency of
        International Concern.&#8221;&#160; This worldwide outbreak has resulted in the implementation of significant governmental measures
 including lockdowns
 closures
 quarantines and travel bans intended to control the spread of the virus. Companies are also
        taking precautions
 such as requiring employees to work remotely
 imposing travel restrictions and temporarily closing businesses and facilities. These restrictions
 and future prevention and mitigation measures
 have had an adverse impact on
        global economic conditions and are likely to have an adverse impact on consumer confidence and spending
 which could materially adversely affect the supply of
 as well as the demand for
 our products. Uncertainties regarding the economic impact of
        COVID-19 is likely to result in sustained market turmoil
 which could also negatively impact our business

      

 or any of our other suppliers
 co-manufacturers
        distributors or transportation or logistics providers
 may negatively affect the price and availability of our ingredients and/or packaging materials and impact our supply chain. If the disruptions caused by COVID-19 continue for an extended period
        of time
 our ability to meet the demands of our customers may be materially impacted. To date
 we have not experienced any reduction in the available supply of our products. As of March 2020
 the United States Department of Homeland Security has
        classified businesses that manufacture

      

 Florida. If we are forced to scale back hours of operation or close these facilities in response to the pandemic
 we
        expect our business
 financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. Additionally
 many of our employees
 including members of our management team
 have been working remotely as a result of the closure of our
        offices in Florida
 Ohio and New York in compliance with local and state regulations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If our operations or productivity continue to be impacted throughout the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak and
        government-mandated closures
 which may negatively impact our business
 financial condition and cash flows. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will further impact our business will depend on future developments and
 given the uncertainty
        around the extent and timing of the potential future spread or mitigation and around the imposition or relaxation of protective measures

      

 including the duration
 spread and intensity of the outbreak
 all of which are uncertain
        and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape. As a result
 it is not currently possible to ascertain the overall impact of COVID-19 on our business. However
 if the pandemic continues for a prolonged period it could have a
        material adverse effect on our business

        resources in a growth strategy that ultimately proves unsuccessful
 our business

      
We may have difficulties managing our anticipated growth
 or we may not grow at all
      

 such growth could strain our management team and capital resources. Our ability to manage operations and control growth will be dependent on our ability to raise
        and spend capital to successfully attract
 train
 motivate
 retain and manage new members of senior management and other key personnel and continue to update and improve our management and operational systems
 infrastructure and other resources
        financial and management controls
 and reporting systems and procedures. Failure to manage our growth effectively could cause us to misallocate management or financial resources
 and result in additional expenditures and inefficient use of existing
        human and capital resources or we otherwise may be forced to grow at a slower pace that could impair or eliminate our ability to achieve and sustain profitability. Such slower than expected growth may require us to restrict or cease our operations

      

 our anticipated growth will increase the demands placed on our suppliers
 resulting in an increased need for us to manage our suppliers and monitor for quality assurance and comply with

      


      

 2019 and had $201.3 million in accumulated deficit at December 31
 2019. Because we have a
        short operating history at scale
 it is difficult for us to predict our future operating results. As a result
 our losses may be larger than anticipated
 and we may not achieve profitability when expected
 or at all. Also
 we expect our operating
        expenses to increase over the next several years as we further increase marketing spend
 hire more employees
 continue to develop new products and services
 and expand internationally. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not
        result in increased revenue or growth in our business. Any failure to increase our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability or positive cash flow on a
        consistent basis. Furthermore
 if our future growth and operating performance fail to meet investor or analyst expectations
 or if we have future negative cash flow or losses resulting from our investment in acquiring new customers or expanding our
        business
 our business

      


        

          
        

      
      


 we have incurred significant debt under subordinated convertible promissory notes and the short term loan and a revolving line of credit entered into in connection with the Halo Acquisition (the &#8216;&#8216;Facilities
          Agreement&#8221;). The obligations under our Facilities Agreement are guaranteed by each of the Company&#8217;s domestic subsidiaries and secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and the assets of
          domestic subsidiaries. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations depends upon our operating and financial performance
 which is subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial
 business and other factors affecting
          our operations
 many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to service our debt
 we may need to sell inventory and other material assets
 restructure or refinance our debt
 or seek additional equity capital. If our inability to meet
          our debt service obligations results in an event of default as defined under the subordinated convertible promissory notes or our Facilities Agreement
 the lenders thereunder may be able to take possession of substantially all of the assets of
          the Company. Prevailing economic conditions and global credit markets could adversely impact our ability to do so. Our debt agreements contain limits on our ability to
 among other things
 incur additional debt
 grant liens
 undergo certain
          fundamental changes
 make investments


      

      
      

        resources for the foreseeable future. Without additional financing
 these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern
 meaning that we may be unable to continue operations for the foreseeable future or
        realize assets and discharge liabilities in the ordinary course of operations. If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future and there remains doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern
 investors or
        other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding
 our business
 prospects
 financial condition and results of operations will be
        materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern
 we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our
        consolidated financial statements

      
      
      

 and there is no assurance that we will generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to run our operations
        service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow
 we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives
 such as selling assets
 restructuring our existing debt or obtaining additional equity
        capital. The evolving nature of the business in which we operate may also make it more challenging to raise additional capital. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to

      


        

          
        


        over financial reporting

      

 TruPet
 which was determined to be the accounting acquirer (see &#8220;Note 1 &#8211; Nature of business and summary of significant accounting policies&#8221; included in
        this Annual Report on Form 10-K)
 was a private company and had limited accounting and financial reporting personnel and other resources with which to address its internal control over financial reporting. In connection with the preparation of the
        financial statements for the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31
 2019
 our management
 with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer
 Werner von Pein and our Chief Financial Officer
 Andreas
        Schulmeyer
 evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2019 and determined they were not effective. A material weakness is a deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over
        financial reporting

      

 as result
 the Company does not have (x) segregation of
        duties and evidence of fiduciary oversight related to the financial statement close process
 cash disbursements process
 contract approval process and time and expense reimbursement process; (y) formally documented accounting policies and
        procedures that are effective and consistently applied in accordance with GAAP; (z) effective controls and resources to address the accounting requirements for new accounting pronouncements; (ii) the Company&#8217;s financial statement close process and
        disclosure controls and procedures
 including the secondary review and approval of financial information generated to prepare the consolidated financial statements
 and the lack of integration of the underlying IT systems used to consolidate the
        Company&#8217;s subsidiaries
 are ineffective and
 as a result
 the Company has been unable to close its books or fulfill its SEC reporting requirements in a timely manner; and (iii) the Company has ineffective controls for assessing its sales tax
        obligations

      

Although
to help review
 revise and amend the internal processes to develop effective controls
        there can be no assurance that these efforts will remediate the material weaknesses or avoid future weaknesses or deficiencies. Any failure to remediate the material weakness and any future weaknesses or deficiencies or any failure to implement
        required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. If we are unable to remediate the
        material weaknesses
 our management may not be able to conclude that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting are effective
 which could result in investors losing confidence in our reported financial

      


 as a result

      


 which makes it difficult to forecast our future results
        particularly with respect to sales made via our DTC platform and sales made in the Retail channel to e-commerce brick and mortar partners. You should not rely on our past annual or quarterly results of operations as indicators of future
        performance. Because we are in the early stages of operating our business
 we are subject to many of the same risks inherent in the operation of a business with a limited operating history. You should consider and evaluate our prospects in light of
        the risks and uncertainty frequently encountered by companies like ours
 including the potential inability to continue as a going concern. We will need to raise substantial additional capital
 but adequate additional capital may not be available
        when we need it

      

        acceptable terms
 or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital
 our business may be harmed and we may need to curtail or cease operations. We may sell equity securities or debt securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a
        manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in subsequent transactions
 our current investors may be materially diluted. Any debt financing
 if available
 may involve restrictive covenants and could reduce our
        operational flexibility or profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms

      


        

          
        

The combined business may be unable to integrate Bona Vida
 Halo and TruPet&#8217;s businesses successfully and realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions
      

 we completed three significant acquisitions that involved the combination of three businesses that historically have operated as independent companies. The success of the
        acquisitions will depend in large part on the success of the management of the combined business in integrating the operations
 strategies
 technologies and personnel of the companies. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits

      

 Halo or TruPet or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions could
        impair our operations. The combined business will be required to devote management attention and resources to integrating Bona Vida&#8217;s

 we could lose revenue

      


 in part
 on our ability to develop and market new products and improvements to our existing products
 including those that we may develop through partnerships
 strategic
        relationships or licensing arrangements. We are always assessing and identifying new opportunities to provide additional products and related services to our customers. The process of identifying and commercializing new products is complex
        uncertain and may involve considerable costs
 and if we fail to accurately predict customers&#8217; changing needs and preferences
 our business could be harmed. The success of our innovation and product development efforts is affected by the technical
        capability of our product development staff
 the ability to establish new supplier relationships and third-party consultants in developing and testing new products
 including complying with governmental regulations
 our attractiveness as a partner
        for outside research and development scientists and entrepreneurs and the success of our management and sales team in introducing and marketing new products. We have already and may have to continue to commit significant resources to
        commercializing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept. Implementation of these plans may also divert management&#8217;s attention from other aspects of our business and place a strain on
        management
 operational and financial resources
 as well as our information systems. Launching new products or updating existing products may also leave us with obsolete inventory that we may not be able to sell or we may sell at significantly
        discounted prices. Furthermore
 we may not execute successfully on commercializing those products because of errors in product planning or timing
 technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion
 or a lack of appropriate resources.

      

 including proper new product definition
 timely completion and introduction of these products
 differentiation of new products from those of
        our competitors
 the possibility of increased competition with our current products
 unrecovered costs associated with failed product introductions and market acceptance of these products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully
        identify additional new product opportunities
 develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner
 or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or
        technologies obsolete or non-competitive. Furthermore
 the timing and cost of our research and development initiatives may increase as a result of additional government regulation or otherwise
 making it more time-consuming and/or costly to
        research

        by certain supermarkets
 warehouse clubs
 and other mass and general retail and online merchandisers and the entrance of other specialty retailers into the pet food and pet supply market. For example
 General Mills
 one of the largest mass market
        consumer goods companies

 Amazon launched its own pet products brand and announced

      

 which are larger than we are
        and have greater financial resources. Price gaps between products may result in market share erosion and harm our business. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative or strategic relationships amongst themselves or with
        third parties that may further enhance their resources and offerings. Further
 it is possible that domestic or foreign companies
 some with greater experience in the pet health and wellness industry or greater financial resources than we possess

      

 and potential competitors may have
 longer operating histories
 greater brand recognition
 larger fulfillment infrastructures
 greater technical capabilities
        significantly greater financial
 marketing and other resources and larger customer bases than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to derive greater net sales and profits from their existing customer base
 acquire customers at lower costs
        or respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in consumer preferences or habits. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts
 undertake more far reaching marketing campaigns and
        adopt more aggressive pricing policies (including but not limited to predatory pricing policies and the provision of substantial discounts)
 which may allow them to build larger customer bases or generate net sales from their customer bases more

 which may impact us and the entire pet health and wellness industry. Increased competition as to any of our products
        could result in price reduction
 increased costs
 reduced margins and loss of market share
 which could negatively affect our profitability. While we believe we are better equipped to customize products for the pet health and wellness market
        generally and CBD products more specifically as compared to other companies in the industry
 there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against these other companies. Expansion into markets served by our competitors and
        entry of new competitors or expansion of existing competitors into our markets could materially adversely affect our business

 on our ability to attract new

 and we expect that we will continue to make
 significant investments
        in attracting and retaining customers. Marketing campaigns can be expensive and may not result in the cost-effective acquisition
 or retention
 of customers. Further
 as our brand becomes more widely known
 future marketing campaigns may not
        attract new or retain customers at the same rate as past campaigns. If we are unable to attract new customers

 and as a result
 it is difficult to estimate the size of the market and predict the rate at which the market for our
        products will grow
 if at all. While our market size estimate was made in good faith and is based on assumptions and estimates we believe to be reasonable
 this estimate may not be accurate. If our estimates of the size of our addressable market

 our potential for future growth may be less than we currently anticipate

 packaging materials

      

 packaging materials and freight are subject to fluctuations in price attributable to
 among other things
 changes in supply and demand of raw materials
 or other
        commodities
 fuel prices and government-sponsored agricultural programs. The sales prices to our DTC customers are a delivered price. Therefore
 changes in our input costs could impact our gross margins. Our ability to pass along higher costs
        through price increases to our customers is dependent upon competitive conditions and pricing methodologies employed in the various markets in which we compete. To the extent competitors do not also increase their prices
 customers and consumers

      
We use significant quantities of food ingredients and other products as well as plastic packaging materials provided by third-party suppliers. We buy from a variety of producers and
          manufacturers
 and alternate sources of supply are generally available. However
 the supply and price are subject to market conditions and are influenced by other factors beyond our control

        &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business and Industry&#8212; The COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse impact on our business

          with many of our suppliers

 as a result
 they could increase prices or fail to deliver. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could increase our costs and disrupt our operations.
      
      
      

 regulatory action and litigation if our products are alleged to have caused loss or injury or failed to include adequate instructions for use or failed to
        include adequate warnings concerning possible side effects or interactions with other substances. Previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from animal consumption of CBD products alone or in combination with other medications or substances
        could also occur. In addition
 the sale of any ingested product involves a risk of injury due to tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination. Our products may also be subject to product recalls
 including voluntary recalls or
        withdrawals
 if they are alleged to pose a risk of injury or illness
 or if they are alleged to have been mislabeled
 misbranded or adulterated or to otherwise be in violation of governmental regulations. We have in the past recalled
 and may again
        in the future have to recall
 certain of our products as a result of potential contamination and quality assurance concerns. A product liability claim or regulatory action against us could result in increased costs and could adversely affect our
        reputation and goodwill with our patients and consumers generally. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Such insurance is
        expensive and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms
 or at all. The inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could result in us

      


      

        products will develop in any such foreign jurisdiction. We may face new or unexpected risks or significantly increase our exposure to one or more existing risk factors
 including economic instability
 new competition
 changes in laws and
        regulations
 including the possibility that we could be in violation of these laws and regulations as a result of such changes
 and the effects of competition. These factors may limit our capability to successfully expand our operations in
 or
        export our products to

      

        

          
        



      

        that may cause our estimates to be inaccurate and affect our ability to obtain adequate third-party contract manufacturing capacity in order to meet the demand for our products
 which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and harm
        our brand and our business. If we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand
 our business

      

 we have relied on a single supplier
 GenCanna
 for all of our supply of CBD. However
bankruptcy in February 2020
 we intend
        to utilize spot purchase contracts with other suppliers of CBD as necessary. We may encounter difficulties in finding substitute suppliers in a timely manner
 if at all
 given the strict licensing requirements in this industry and there are a
        limited number of suppliers that currently hold such licenses and comply with the 2014 Farm Bill or 2018 Farm Bill
 as applicable in their respective states. If a sole source supplier were to be acquired by a competitor
 the competitor may elect
        not to sell to us at all. If for any reason we were to change any one of our third-party contract manufacturers
 we could face difficulties that might adversely affect our ability to maintain an adequate supply of our products
 and we would incur
        costs and expend resources in the course of making the change. Moreover
 we might not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those received from our current third-party contract manufacturers

      

 we must continuously monitor our inventory and product mix against forecasted demand. If we underestimate demand
 we risk having inadequate supplies. We also face the risk of having too
        much inventory on hand that may reach its expiration date and become unsalable
 and we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow-moving inventory. If we are unable to manage our supply chain effectively

      

 shipment or receipt of our merchandise

      

        to our specifications by factories within the United States and New Zealand. We cannot control all of the various factors
 which include inclement weather; natural disasters
 such as earthquakes
 hurricanes
 tornadoes
 floods and other adverse
        weather and climate conditions; political and financial instability; strikes; unforeseen public health crises
 such as pandemics and epidemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic; acts of war or terrorism and other catastrophic events
 whether occurring
        in the United States or internationally

      

 Florida
 a city that is particularly vulnerable to hurricanes
 floods
 tornadoes and sinkholes. If any such disaster were to impact
        this facility
 our operations would be materially disrupted. Inadequate labor conditions
 health or safety issues in the factories where goods are produced can negatively impact our brand reputation. Late delivery of products or delivery of
        products that do not meet our quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers or delay timely delivery of merchandise to our stores or our wholesale customers for those items. From time to time
 a
        third-party contract manufacturer may experience financial difficulties
 bankruptcy or other business disruptions
 which could disrupt our supply of products or require that we incur additional expense by providing financial accommodations to the
        third-party contract manufacturer or taking other steps to seek to minimize or avoid supply disruption
 such as establishing a new third-party contract manufacturing arrangement with another provider. These events could cause us to fail to meet
        customer expectations
 cause our DTC or Retail customers to cancel orders or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities or of sufficient quality to our DTC or Retail customers
 which could result in lost sales and have a
        material adverse effect on our business

      

 we may be unable to locate an additional or alternate third-party contract manufacturing arrangement in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms
 if at all. Identifying a suitable
        manufacturer is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with the prospective manufacturer&#8217;s level of expertise
 quality control
 responsiveness and service
 financial stability and labor practices. Any delay
 interruption or
        increased cost in the proprietary value-branded products that might occur for any reason could affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products
 adversely affect our net sales
 increase our cost of sales and hurt our results of
        operations. In addition
 manufacturing disruption could injure our reputation and customer relationships

      

        

          
        

      
      

        or negative change in the availability or economics of the supply chain for key inputs could materially impact our business
 financial condition
 results of operations or prospects. Some of these inputs may only be available from a single supplier
        or a limited group of suppliers. If a sole source supplier was to go out of business
 we might be unable to find a replacement for such source in a timely manner or at all. If a sole source supplier were to be acquired by a competitor
 that
        competitor may elect not to sell to us in the future. Any inability to secure required supplies and services or to do so on appropriate terms could have a materially adverse impact on our business
 financial condition
 results of operations or

      

 alleged to be contaminated or are otherwise rumored to have adverse effects
 our results of operations could be adversely

      

        have adverse effects
 for any reason
 we may sustain the costs of and possible litigation resulting from a product recall and need to find alternate ingredients
 delay production
 or discard or otherwise dispose of products
 which could adversely
        affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. In addition
 if any of our competitors experience similar events
 our reputation could be damaged
 including as a result of a loss of consumer confidence in the types of products

      

 our insurance may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur in connection with
        product liability claims
 including among others
 that the products we sell caused injury or illness
 include inadequate instructions for use or include inadequate warnings concerning possible side effects or interactions with other substances. For
        example
 punitive damages are generally not covered by insurance. If we are subject to substantial product liability claims in the future
 we may not be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance
 obtain comparable insurance at a
        reasonable cost
 if at all
 or secure additional coverage. This could result in future product liability claims being uninsured. If there is a product liability judgment against us or a settlement agreement related to a product liability claim
 our
        business
 financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition
 even if product liability claims against us are not successful or are not fully pursued
 these claims could be costly and time-consuming and

      


      

        contract manufacturers and to ship products from our manufacturing and distribution warehouses to our customers. Our utilization of these delivery services
 or those of any other shipping companies that we may elect to use
 is subject to risks
        including increases in fuel prices
 which would increase our shipping costs
 employee strikes
 organized labor activities and inclement weather
 which may impact the shipping company&#8217;s ability to provide delivery services sufficient to meet our
        shipping needs. Furthermore
 if we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties
 it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. If any of
        the foregoing occurs
 our business

      

        

          
        



      

 developing and expanding our reputation with our customers and our suppliers is critical to our success. Our brand may suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives are not
        successful. The importance of our brand may decrease if competitors offer more products similar to the products that we manufacture. Further
 our brands may be negatively impacted due to real or perceived quality issues or if consumers perceive us
        as being untruthful in our marketing and advertising
 even if such perceptions are not accurate. Product contamination
 the failure to maintain high standards for product quality
 safety and integrity
 including raw materials and ingredients
        obtained from suppliers
 or allegations of product quality issues
 mislabeling or contamination
 even if untrue or caused by our third-party contract manufacturing partners or raw material suppliers
 may reduce demand for our products or cause
        production and delivery disruptions. However
 we may be unable to detect or prevent product and/or ingredient quality issues
 mislabeling or contamination
 particularly in instances of fraud or attempts to cover up or obscure deviations from our
        guidelines and procedures. If any of our products become unfit for consumption
 cause injury or are mislabeled
 we may have to engage in a product recall and/or be subject to liability. Damage to our reputation or our brands or loss of consumer
        confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and our business
 financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition
 if any of our
        competitors experience similar events
 our reputation could be damaged

      

 our corporate reputation is susceptible to damage by actions or statements made by current or former employees
 competitors
 vendors
 adversaries in legal proceedings and government regulators
        as well as members of the investment community and the media. There is a risk that negative information about our company
 even if based on false rumor or misunderstanding
 could adversely affect our business
 results of operations
 and financial
        condition. In particular
 damage to our reputation could be difficult and time-consuming to repair
 could make potential or existing Retail customers reluctant to select us for new engagements
 resulting in a loss of business
 and could adversely

 we must effectively and efficiently promote and market our products through advertisements as well as through trade promotions and incentives to sustain and improve our
        competitive position in our market. Marketing investments may be costly. In addition
 we may
 from time to time
 change our marketing strategies and spending
 including the timing or nature of our trade promotions and incentives. We may also change
        our marketing strategies and spending in response to actions by our customers
 competitors and other companies that manufacture and/or distribute pet health and wellness products. The sufficiency and effectiveness of our marketing and trade
        promotions and incentives are important to our ability to retain and improve our market share and margins. If our marketing and trade promotions and incentives are not successful or if we fail to implement sufficient and effective marketing and
        trade promotions and incentives or adequately respond to changes in industry marketing strategies

 our ability to generate revenue and our ability to attract and retain our customers may
        be impacted
 negatively affecting our business and results of operations. In addition

 both in the United States and in foreign countries
 through a combination of patent
 trademark
 copyright and trade secret laws
 as well as licensing agreements
        and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements. Because of the differences in foreign trademark
 patent and other laws concerning proprietary rights
 our intellectual property rights may not receive the same degree of protection in foreign
        countries as they would in the United States. Our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business

 and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. We cannot assure you that
        our trademark applications will be approved. Third parties may also oppose our trademark applications
 or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged
 we could be forced to rebrand our
        products
 which could result in loss of brand recognition
 and could require us to devote resources advertising and marketing new brands. Further
 we cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe our trademarks
 or that we will have adequate

      


      

 even those without merit
 could be expensive and time consuming to
        defend; could require us to cease selling the products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property
 could require us to redesign

 or rebrand the product
 if feasible
 could divert management&#8217;s attention and resources
 or could

      

 if required
 may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. A successful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant damages

 or stop the sale of certain products
 any of which could have a negative impact on our business
 financial condition

      

 and if we are unable to retain and motivate them or recruit additional qualified personnel
 our business may

      

 as well as other key employees. Our success will depend on our ability to retain our current management and key employees
        and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future
 and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain our personnel or attract new
 qualified personnel. In addition
 we do not maintain any &#8220;key person&#8221; life insurance policies. The
        loss of the services of members of our senior management or key employees could prevent or delay the implementation and completion of our strategic objectives

      

 other applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws
 and applicable trade control laws could subject us to penalties and other

      

 as well as the anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in the countries
        where we do business. The FCPA prohibits covered parties from offering
 promising
 authorizing or giving anything of value
 directly or indirectly
 to a &#8220;foreign government official&#8221; with the intent of improperly influencing the official&#8217;s act or
        decision
 inducing the official to act or refrain from acting in violation of lawful duty
 or obtaining or retaining an improper business advantage. The FCPA also requires publicly traded companies to maintain records that accurately and fairly
        represent their transactions
 and to have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. In addition
 other applicable anti-corruption laws prohibit bribery of domestic government officials
 and some laws that may apply to our operations
        prohibit commercial bribery
 including giving or receiving improper payments to or from non-government parties
 as well as so-called &#8220;facilitation&#8221; payments. In addition
 we are subject to U.S. and other applicable trade control regulations that
        restrict with whom we may transact business
 including the trade sanctions enforced by the U.S. Treasury
 Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;). We also plan to expand our operations outside of the United States in the future and our risks

      


        

          
        


 internal controls and other measures reasonably designed to promote compliance with applicable anticorruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations
 and certain
        safeguards designed to ensure compliance with U.S. trade control laws
 our employees or agents may engage in improper conduct for which we might be held responsible. Any violations of these anti-corruption or trade controls laws
 or even
        allegations of such violations
 can lead to an investigation and/or enforcement action
 which could disrupt our operations
 involve significant management distraction
 and lead to significant costs and expenses
 including legal fees. If we
 or our
        employees or agents acting on our behalf
 are found to have engaged in practices that violate these laws and regulations
 we could suffer severe fines and penalties
 profit disgorgement
 injunctions on future conduct
 securities litigation
 bans on
        transacting government business
 delisting from securities exchanges and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations. In addition
 our brand and reputation
 our sales
        activities or our stock price could be adversely affected if we become the subject of any negative publicity related to actual or potential violations of anti-corruption

      


      

 accounting and financial and legal and
        compliance functions
 engineering and product development tasks
 research and development data
 communications
 supply chain
 order entry and fulfillment and other business processes. We also rely on third parties and virtualized infrastructure to
        operate and support our information technology systems. The failure of our information technology systems
 or those of our third-party service providers
 to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors
        processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers

      


 our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control
 including fire
 natural disasters
 power outages
 systems failures
 security breaches
        cyber-attacks and computer viruses. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as a result of any of these factors or our failure to effectively restore our systems or implement new systems could disrupt our entire operation and
        could result in decreased sales
 increased overhead costs

      

 it is critically important for us to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of our information technology systems. To the extent that we have information in our databases that our customers consider
        confidential or sensitive
 any unauthorized disclosure of
 or access to
 such information due to human error
 breach of our systems through cybercrime
 a leak of confidential information due to employee misconduct or similar events could result in
        a violation of applicable data privacy and security
 data protection
 and consumer protection laws and regulations
 legal and financial exposure
 damage to our reputation
 a loss of confidence of our customers
 suppliers and manufacturers and lost
        sales. Actual or suspected cyber-attacks may cause us to incur substantial costs
 including costs to investigate
 deploy additional personnel and protection technologies
 train employees and engage third-party experts and consultants. We have taken
        steps to protect the security of our systems. Despite the implementation of these security measures
 our systems may still be vulnerable to physical break-ins
 computer viruses
 programming errors
 attacks by third parties or similar disruptive
        problems. If any of these risks materialize

 bandwidth providers
 Internet service providers and mobile networks to deliver e-mail and &#8220;push&#8221;

      


 or failure of
 our systems or the systems of our third-party commerce platform providers could result in interruptions to the availability or functionality of our website and mobile applications. As a
        result
 we could lose customer data and miss order fulfillment deadlines
 which could result in decreased sales
 increased overhead costs
 excess inventory and product shortages. If for any reason our arrangements with our third-party commerce
        platform providers are terminated or interrupted
 such termination or interruption could adversely affect our business
 financial condition
 and results of operations. We exercise little control over these providers
 which increases our
        vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. We could experience additional expense in arranging for new facilities
 technology
 services and support. In addition
 the failure of our third-party commerce platform providers to meet our

      


        

          
        


 state and foreign laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security
 data protection and consumer protection
 or the expansion of current or the enactment of
        new laws or regulations relating to data privacy and security
 data protection and consumer protection

      

 collect
 store
 process
 transfer
 and use personal information and other data relating to our customers
 website visitors
 employees
 vendors&#8217; and contractors&#8217; employees
 and other persons
 and we rely in
        part on third parties that are not directly under our control to manage certain of these operations and to collect
 store
 process and use payment information. Due to the volume and sensitivity of the personal information and other data that we and
        these third parties manage and expect to manage in the future
 as well as the nature of our customer base
 the security features of our information systems are critical. A variety of federal
 state and foreign laws and regulations govern the
        collection
 use
 retention
 sharing and security of this information. Laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security
 data protection and consumer protection are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. Given the
        uncertainty and complexity of the regulatory framework for data privacy and security
 data protection and consumer protection worldwide
 there is the potential that these or other actual or alleged obligations may not be harmonized
 may be
        interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another
 or may be interpreted and applied in such a way as to conflict with our other legal obligations or practices. In addition
 we are also subject to certain
        contractual obligations to third parties related to data privacy and security and data protection. As a result
 while we strive to comply with applicable laws and regulations
 our applicable policies and contractual obligations
 and all other
        applicable legal obligations relating to data privacy and security
 data protection and consumer protection to the extent possible
 our practices may not have complied or may not comply in the future with all such laws
 regulations
 requirements

      

 laws and regulations will continue to be proposed regarding data privacy and security
 data protection and consumer protection in many jurisdictions. The California Consumer
        Privacy Act of 2018 (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;)
 which went into effect in 2020
 created new data privacy rights for California residents and new compliance obligations and risks for us. We cannot yet determine the impact such new and future laws
 regulations and
        standards may have on our business. Complying with these evolving obligations is costly. For instance
 expanding definitions and interpretations of what constitutes &#8220;personal information&#8221; (or the equivalent) within the United States and elsewhere
        may increase our compliance costs and legal liability. A significant data breach or any failure
 or perceived failure
 by us to comply with any federal
 state or foreign data privacy and security
 data protection or consumer protection-related
        laws
 regulations or other principles or orders to which we may be subject or other legal obligations relating to data privacy and security
 data protection or consumer protection could adversely affect our reputation
 brand and business
 and may
        result in claims
 investigations
 proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other penalties or liabilities
 or require us to change our operations and/or cease using certain data sets. Depending on the nature of the
        information compromised
 we may also have obligations to notify users
 other individuals
 law enforcement
 consumer protection agencies
 payment companies
 or other third party companies about the incident and may need to provide some form of
        remedy
 such as refunds or services like identity theft protection

      
      
      

 including credit cards and debit cards. As we offer new payment options to customers
 we may be subject to additional regulations
 compliance requirements and fraud. For
        certain payment methods
 including credit and debit cards
 we pay interchange and other fees
 which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules
        certification requirements
 and security standards
 including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and rules governing electronic funds transfers
 which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to
        comply. As our business changes
 we may also be subject to different rules under existing standards
 which may require new assessments that involve costs above what we currently pay for compliance. If we or our third-party payment processors or
        commerce platforms fail to comply with the rules or requirements of any provider of a payment method we accept
 if the volume of fraud in our transactions limits or terminates our rights to use payment methods we currently accept
 or if a data
        breach occurs relating to our payment systems
 we may
 among other things
 be subject to fines or higher transaction fees and may lose
 or face restrictions placed upon
 our ability to accept credit card and debit card payments from customers or
        facilitate other types of online payments. If any of these events were to occur
 our business
 financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. We occasionally receive orders placed with fraudulent credit card data.
        We may suffer losses as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data even if the associated financial institution approved payment of the orders. Under current credit card practices
 we may be liable for fraudulent credit card
        transactions. If we are unable to detect or control credit card fraud
 our liability for these transactions could harm our business

      


        

          
        

      
      

 subject to our return and refunds policy. If merchandise returns or refunds are significant or higher than anticipated and forecasted
 our business
 financial
        condition
 and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further
 we modify our policies relating to returns or refunds from time to time
 and may do so in the future
 which may result in customer dissatisfaction and harm to our reputation
        or brand

      

 and our insurance coverage may have limitations and other exclusions and may not be sufficient to cover our

      

 operations and employees. While we believe our insurance coverage addresses all material risks to which we are exposed and is adequate and customary in our current state of
        operations
 such insurance is subject to coverage limits and exclusions and may not be available for the risks and hazards to which we are exposed. No assurance can be given that such insurance will be adequate to cover our liabilities or will be
        generally available in the future or
 if available
 that premiums will be commercially justifiable. In addition
 insurance that is otherwise readily available
 such as general liability
 and directors and officer&#8217;s insurance
 may become more
        difficult for us to find
 and more expensive
 due to our CBD products. There are no guarantees that we will be able to find such insurances in the future
 or that the cost will be affordable to us. If we are unable to obtain such insurances or if
        we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits
 we may be prevented from entering into certain business sectors
 our growth may be inhibited
 and we may be exposed to
        additional risk and financial liabilities
 which could have a material adverse effect on our business

      

 our net sales in a subsequent period may be adversely affected as our Retail customers seek to

      

 our wholesale customers may purchase more products than they expect to sell to consumers during a particular time period. Our Retail customers may grow their inventory in anticipation of
 or during
        our promotional events
 which typically provide for reduced prices during a specified time or other incentives. Our Retail customers may also increase inventory in anticipation of a price increase for our products
 or otherwise over order our
        products as a result of overestimating demand for our products. If a Retail customer increases its inventory during a particular reporting period as a result of a promotional event
 anticipated price increase or otherwise
 then our net sales during
        the subsequent reporting period may be adversely impacted as our Retail customers seek to reduce their inventory to customary levels. This effect may be particularly pronounced when the promotional event
 price increase or other event occurs near
        the end or beginning of a reporting period or when there are changes in the timing of a promotional event
 price increase or similar event
 as compared to the prior year. To the extent our Retail customers seek to reduce their usual or customary
        inventory levels or change their practices regarding purchases in excess of consumer consumption

      

 whether for quality
 palatability
 appearance or otherwise. If there
        is any future product recall or withdrawal
 it could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures
 destruction of product inventory
 damage to our reputation and lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time
 and our
        business
 financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition

      

 financial condition and results of

      

 we are subject to allegations
 and may be party to legal claims and regulatory proceedings
 relating to our business operations. Such allegations
 claims and proceedings may be brought by third
        parties
 including our customers
 employees
 governmental or regulatory bodies or competitors. Defending against such claims and proceedings
 regardless of their merits or outcomes
 is costly and time consuming and may divert management&#8217;s attention
        and personnel resources from our normal business operations
 and the outcome of many of these claims and proceedings cannot be predicted. If any of these claims or proceedings were to be determined adversely to us
 a judgment
 a fine or a
        settlement involving a payment of a material sum of money were to occur
 or injunctive relief were issued against us
 our reputation could be affected and our business
 financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely

      


        

          
        

      
      

 financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by a
        challenging economic climate
 including adverse changes in interest rates
 volatile commodity markets and inflation
 contraction in the availability of credit in the market and reductions in consumer spending. In addition
 a slow-down in the
        general economy or a shift in consumer preferences to less expensive products may result in reduced demand for our products which may affect our profitability. The keeping of pets and the purchase of pet-related products may constitute
        discretionary spending for some of our consumers and any material decline in the amount of consumer discretionary spending may reduce overall levels of pet ownership or spending on pets. As a result
 a challenging economic climate may cause a
        decline in demand for our products which could be disproportionate as compared to competing pet food brands since our products command a price premium. If economic conditions result in decreased spending on pets and have a negative impact on our
        suppliers or distributors

        limitations apply if we experience an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; (generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in the ownership of our equity by certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period). Similar provisions of
        state tax law may also apply. We have not assessed
 including with respect to the December 19
 2019 acquisition of Halo
 whether such an ownership change has previously occurred. If we have experienced an ownership change at any time since our
        formation
 we may already be subject to limitations on our ability to utilize our existing net operating losses to offset taxable income. In addition
 future changes in our stock ownership
 which may be outside of our control
 may trigger an
        ownership change and
 consequently
 the limitations under Section 382. As a result
 if or when we earn net taxable income
 our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset such taxable income may be subject to
        limitations

        third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers
 are subject to periodic inspection by federal
 state and local authorities. If our third-party contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture products that conform to our specifications and
        the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA and applicable state and local laws
 they may be subject to adverse inspectional findings or enforcement actions
 which could materially impact our ability to market our products
 could result in their

&#8221; and the FDA has issued warning letters to companies for improper marketing of CBD products on this basis. In addition
 the FTC has issued warning letters to companies for failing to properly
        substantiate their CBD product claims
 which constitutes false advertising. For these and other reasons
 the FDA
 FTC and other regulatory authorities may consider our products to be new animal drugs without adequate substantiation or approval for
        our claims
 which could lead to statutory and regulatory violations

      

 licenses and registrations relating to
        our or our partners&#8217; operations could subject us to administrative and civil penalties
 including fines
 injunctions
 recalls or seizures
 warning letters
 restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of our products
 or refusals to permit the
        import or export of products
 as well as potential criminal sanctions

      

 including animal foods and supplements
 that contain CBD. The FDA is currently evaluating a
        potential regulatory pathway for CBD products pursuant to its current authorities
 but unless and until such changes are promulgated
 the FDA and other federal and state regulatory authorities could take enforcement action to prevent us from
        marketing pet food
 products and supplements with CBD
 which could adversely impact our business

      

 the FDA has stated publicly that it is nonetheless unlawful under the FDCA to introduce animal food
 which
        includes products intended for animals labeled as food
 treats
 or supplements
 containing CBD into interstate commerce. The FDCA prohibits the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that contains an approved
        drug or a drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and made public
 unless a statutory exemption applies. The FDA has publicly stated its conclusion that none of the statutory exceptions has been met for CBD. See

      
On May 31
 2019
 the FDA held a public hearing to obtain scientific data and information about the safety
 manufacturing
 product quality
 marketing
 labeling and sale of products
          containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds (such as CBD) to provide the FDA with information as it considers policy options related to the regulation of these products
 particularly in light of the changes to the legal status of hemp
          enacted in the 2018 Farm Bill. The FDA has also formed an internal working group to evaluate the potential pathways to market for CBD products
 which could include seeking statutory changes from Congress or promulgating new regulations. If
          legislative action is necessary
 such legislative changes could take years to finalize and may not include provisions that would enable us to produce
 market and/or sell our CBD products
 and FDA could similarly take years to promulgate new
          regulations. Additionally
 while the agency&#8217;s enforcement focus to date has primarily been on CBD products that are associated with therapeutic claims
 the agency has recently issued warning letters to companies marketing CBD products without
          such claims
 and there is a risk that FDA could take enforcement action against us
 our third-party contract manufacturers or suppliers
 or those marketing similar products to us
 which could limit or prevent us from marketing our products and
          have a material adverse impact on our business
 financial condition and results of operations. While the FDA announced on March 5
to
          provide more clarity to industry and the public while the agency takes potential steps to establish a clear regulatory pathway
 it remains unclear whether or when FDA will ultimately issue such an enforcement policy.
      

 local
 state
 federal
 and international CBD
 hemp and cannabis laws and regulations are rapidly changing and subject to evolving interpretations
 which could require us to incur substantial
        costs associated with compliance requirements or alteration of certain aspects of our business plan in the event that our CBD products become subject to new restrictions. In addition
 violations of these laws
 or allegations of such violations
        could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations. It is also possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our products. We cannot predict the nature of any future
        laws
 regulations
 interpretations
 or applications
 nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures
 when and if promulgated
 could have on our activities in the hemp and CBD industry.

      


        

          
        


 including removal from the
        statutory list of controlled substances. However
 implementation of the 2018 Farm Bill is ongoing

      

 the DEA has interpreted CBD to be subject to the CSA
        under the definition for &#8220;marihuana
&#8221; a Schedule I controlled substance. However
 the 2018 Farm Bill removed &#8220;hemp
 and
        any part of that plant
 including the seeds thereof and all derivatives
 extracts
 cannabinoids
 isomers
 acids
 salts
 and salts of isomers
 whether growing or not
 with a THC concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis. As a
        result of the enactment of the 2018 Farm Bill
 and since we believe that the CBD contained in our products and the hemp from which it is derived meet the definition of &#8220;hemp
&#8221; we believe that our CBD products and the hemp from which they are
        derived are not Schedule I controlled substances under the CSA. However
 there is a risk that we could be subject to enforcement action
 including prosecution
 if any of our products are determined to not meet the definition of &#8220;hemp&#8221; and to
        constitute &#8220;marihuana&#8221; under the CSA based on THC levels or other violations

      

 the 2018 Farm Bill contained provisions that require the USDA to
 among other things
 promulgate a new regulatory framework governing the growth and cultivation of hemp
 where hemp grown in
        compliance with the framework would be permitted in interstate commerce throughout the United States. On October 31
 2019
 the USDA issued an IFR establishing the regulations necessary for domestic hemp production
 including provisions for the USDA
        to approve plans submitted by states and Indian tribes for the monitoring and regulation of hemp production at the state level. While the 2018 Farm Bill requires state and tribal plans to meet certain basic requirements as outlined in the IFR
        nothing preempts or limits state or tribal laws that are more stringent than the 2018 Farm Bill
 and the requirements for lawful hemp production will vary from state to state. We and our third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers must expend
        resources monitoring the evolving federal and state legal landscape for hemp production
 and any
 violations of these laws
 or alleged violations

      


      

 including product defects
 such as contamination
 adulteration
        unintended harmful side effects or interactions with other substances
 packaging safety and inadequate or inaccurate labeling disclosure. Although we have detailed procedures in place for testing finished products
 there can be no assurance that
        any quality
 potency or contamination problems will be detected in time to avoid unforeseen product recalls
 regulatory action or lawsuits
 whether frivolous or otherwise. If any of the animal food or care products produced by us are recalled due
        to an alleged product defect or for any other reason
 we could be required to incur the unexpected expense of the recall and any legal proceedings that might arise in connection with the recall. We had to issue a recall in 2018 for one of our
. Although customers reported no incidents of injury or illness in association with
        this product
 the recall negatively affected our results. As a result of any such recall
 we may lose a significant amount of sales and may not be able to replace those sales at an acceptable margin or at all. In addition
 a product recall may

      

 product recalls may lead to increased scrutiny of our operations by the FDA or other state or federal regulatory agencies
 requiring further management attention
 increased compliance
        costs and potential legal fees
 fines
 penalties and other expenses. Any product recall affecting the cannabis industry more broadly
 whether or not involving us
 could also lead consumers to lose confidence in the safety and security of the
        products sold by producers generally

      


        

          
        


 we and our third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers face a variety of state and local restrictions on the cultivation of hemp
 and if state or local
        regulatory authorities take enforcement action to prevent us from selling our products
 our business

      
The growth and cultivation of hemp is subject to a complex regulatory framework that is implemented and affected by multiple federal agencies
 as well as state and local authorities. In
          2014
2014 Farm Bill to allow for the limited growth and cultivation of industrial hemp under federal law. This statute allowed institutions of higher education and state departments of
          agriculture to grow and cultivate industrial hemp for agricultural or other academic research purposes
 or for hemp to be grown under the auspices of a state agricultural pilot program
 in states where such growth and cultivation is legal under
          state law. While the 2018 Farm Bill created a pathway under which hemp and its derivatives
 including CBD
 would no longer be a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA and would be protected from interference in interstate commerce
 the
          USDA only recently issued its IFR containing the regulatory framework to govern the growth and cultivation of hemp
 and several states continue to operate under the 2014 Farm Bill
 which will be repealed after October 31
 2020.&#160; Alongside the
          current federal regulatory developments
 state and local authorities have enacted their own restrictions on the cultivation or sale of hemp or hemp-derived CBD
 including laws that ban the cultivation or possession of hemp or any other plant of
          the cannabis genus and derivatives thereof
 such as CBD. Currently several states ban the cultivation and possession of hemp or CBD
 while others have taken enforcement action against human and pet food products that contain CBD
 and states may
          enact new laws or regulations that prohibit or limit the sale of such products at any time. In the event of a change in federal or state laws and regulations that are adverse to our CBD products
 we may be restricted or limited with respect to
          sale or distribution of those products
 which could adversely impact our intended business plan with respect to such products.
      

 and it remains to be seen which additional states will submit their own regulatory
        plans for the cultivation of hemp and which states become subject to the USDA framework. The timing and content of state regulatory plans may impact our ability to obtain sufficient quantities of CBD at an acceptable price and on a timely basis. If
        our current supplier were to face increased regulation or be unable to continue to supply our business
 we may be unable to fulfill our customer&#8217;s orders or find a suitable replacement supplier in a timely fashion or at comparable prices. If our
        current supplier or any future suppliers fail to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements

      

 including how such existing laws or regulations are enforced by federal
 state
 and local authorities
 or the adoption of new laws or
        regulations may increase our costs and otherwise adversely affect our business

      

 the manufacture and marketing of animal food products is highly regulated
 and we and our third-party contract
        manufacturers and suppliers are subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations applicable to pet food and treats. These laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business
 including the manufacture
 packaging
 labeling
        distribution
 advertising
 sale
 quality and safety of our products. We could incur costs
 including fines
 penalties
 and third-party claims
 in the event of any violations of
 or liabilities under
 such requirements
 including any competitor or
        consumer challenges relating to compliance with such requirements. For example
 in connection with the marketing and advertisement of our products
 we could be the target of claims relating to false or deceptive advertising
 including under the

      

        the future and we may incur (directly
 or indirectly through our third-party contract manufacturers or suppliers) material costs to comply with current or future laws and regulations or any required product recalls. Any change in manufacturing
        labeling
 or marketing requirements for our products may lead to an increase in costs or interruptions in manufacturing or raw material supply
 either of which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. For example
 recent
        federal and state attention to the sale of CBD-containing products
 specifically pet products that contain CBD
 could result in standards or requirements that mandate changes to our current labeling
 product ingredients or marketing. New or revised
        government laws and regulations could significantly limit our ability to run our business as it is currently conducted
 result in additional compliance costs and
 in the event of noncompliance
 lead to administrative or civil remedies
 including
        fines
 injunctions
 withdrawals
 recalls or seizures and confiscations
 as well as potential criminal sanctions. Any such changes or actions by the FDA or other regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on our third-party
        manufacturers
 our suppliers or our business

      


        

          
        


 warnings and public perception could increase our costs of production and increase our legal and regulatory expenses
 and if we are unable to comply with the
        applicable requirements for marketing pet foods

      

 processing
 labeling
 packaging
 storing and distributing pet products are activities subject to extensive federal
 state and local regulation
 as well as foreign regulation. In the
        United States
 these operations are regulated by the FDA and various state and local public health and agricultural agencies. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 provides direct recall authority to the FDA for food products and includes a
        number of other provisions designed to enhance food safety
 including increased inspections by the FDA of domestic and foreign food facilities and increased review of food products imported into the United States. In addition
 many states have
        adopted the Association of American Feed Control Officials&#8217; model pet food regulations or variations thereof
 which generally regulate the information manufacturers provide about pet food. Compliance with government regulation can be costly or may
        otherwise adversely affect our business. Moreover
 failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil remedies
 including fines
 injunctions
 recalls or seizures
 as well as potential criminal sanctions
 which could in
        turn have a material adverse effect on our business

      

 we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims
 government investigations or
        regulatory enforcement actions. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations
 there can be no assurance that our employees
 temporary workers
 contractors or agents will not
        violate our policies and procedures. Moreover
 a failure to maintain effective regulatory compliance policies and procedures could lead to violations
 unintentional or otherwise
 of laws and regulations. Legal claims
 government investigations or
        regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our product sales
 reputation
        financial condition and operating results. In addition
 the costs and other effects of defending potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us may be difficult to determine and could materially adversely affect our
        business

      

 including on animals
 future nonclinical and clinical research studies and analysis of such studies by third parties

 may lead to conclusions that dispute or conflict with our understandings and beliefs regarding the benefits

 viability
 safety and dosing of isolated cannabinoids (such as CBD or THC) remains in relatively early stages. There have been

 reports and studies regarding CBD or could reach different or negative conclusions regarding the medical
        benefits
 viability

 dosing or other facts and perceptions related to CBD
 which could adversely affect acceptance of CBD in foods and the demand for such products. Future research may also cause regulatory authorities to change how they
        enforce regulatory restrictions applicable to hemp and CBD. We cannot predict any negative research and clinical trial findings in the future that may have a material adverse impact on our business

      
      
      

 our ability to change with customer tastes and to meet customer needs with new products. If customers do not accept our products
 our
        sales and revenue will either fail to materialize or decline
 resulting in a reduction in our operating income or possible increases in losses. Demand for CBD and hemp products is also influenced by the popularity of certain aesthetics
 cultural
        and demographic trends
 marketing and advertising expenditures
 legality concerns
 and general economic conditions. Because these factors can change rapidly
 customer demand also can shift quickly. The success of new product introductions depends
        on various factors
 including product selection and quality
 sales and marketing efforts and timely production. We may not always be able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in customer taste and demand due to the amount of time and
        financial resources that may be required to bring new products to market. The inability to respond quickly to market changes could have an impact on our expected growth potential and the growth potential of the market for raw foods and CBD and hemp
        products for pets. Even if this market develops

 except that hemp
 as defined by federal law for exemption from Schedule I of the CSA
 has
        a delta-9 THC concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis. The same plant with a higher THC content is considered marijuana
 which is legal for medical and recreational use under certain state laws
 but which is not legal under
        federal law. The similarities between these plants can cause confusion

      

 despite growing support for the cannabis industry and legalization of marijuana in certain U.S. states
 many individuals and businesses remain opposed to the cultivation and sale of cannabis and
        cannabis-derived products. Any negative publicity resulting from an incorrect perception that we operate in the marijuana space could result in a loss of current or future business. It could also adversely affect the public&#8217;s perception of us or
        our common stock and lead to reluctance by new parties to do business with or invest in us. We cannot assure you that additional business partners
 including but not limited to financial institutions and customers
 will not attempt to end or
        curtail their relationships with us. Any such negative press or impacts to business relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition

      
      
      

        substances
 as defined by the CSA. Under existing IRS guidance
 the bulk of operating costs and general administrative costs of trades or businesses subject to Section 280E of the Code are not permitted to be deducted. Although the 2018 Farm Bill
        created a pathway under which hemp and its derivatives
 including CBD
 would no longer be a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA
 until the USDA implements regulations pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill
 we believe our ability to deduct
        certain ordinary business expenses requires compliance with the 2014 Farm Bill. We do not believe that Section 280E of the Code currently forbids our deduction of otherwise ordinary business expenses because we believe that we are in compliance
        with the 2014 Farm Bill and/or the products we sell are from participants that are compliant with the 2014 Farm Bill. However
 until the USDA promulgates regulations under the 2018 Farm Bill
 non-compliance with the 2014 Farm Bill by us or our

 the trading price of our common stock may rise to an unsustainable level
 particularly in instances where institutional investors may be discouraged from purchasing our common stock because they

 and Preferred Series E&#160; (as defined herein) places certain restrictions on the ability of us and our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends. We may

      

 our board of directors will determine the amount and timing of stockholder dividends

 our directors

        We cannot predict the amount or timing of any future dividends you may receive

 you may not be able to realize any return

000
000 shares of common stock and 4
000
000 shares of preferred stock with such designations
        preferences and rights as determined by our board of directors. The potential issuance of such additional shares of common stock will result in the dilution of the ownership interests of the holders of our common stock and may create downward
        pressure on the trading price
 if any
 of our common stock. The registration rights of certain of our stockholders and the sales of substantial amounts of our common stock following the effectiveness of the Registration Statement on Form S-1 that
        we have filed with the SEC
 or the perception that these sales may occur
 could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and impair our ability to raise capital. These shares also may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities
        Act

      

 we issued Series E Convertible Preferred Stock (&#8220;Series E preferred stock&#8221;). As of April 24

 the Series E preferred stock was convertible into 1

903 shares of common stock
 all of which may
          be sold pursuant to applicable exemptions under the Securities Act

 we issued (i) $2.8 million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated convertible notes (the &#8220;Convertible Notes&#8221;) for total proceeds of $2.8 million to existing shareholders and
        (ii) 11
000 warrants (the &#8220;Warrants&#8221;) to purchase shares of our common stock. Each Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of our common stock and are exercisable any time from the date of issuance for a period of up to 24 months

      

 2019
 in connection with the Halo Acquisition and as part of the consideration payable under the Halo Agreement
 we issued to the Halo sellers and Werner von Pein (i) convertible
        subordinated notes in a total amount of $15
000
000 (the &#8220;Seller Notes&#8221;) and (ii) 937
500 stock purchase warrants (the &#8220;Seller Warrants&#8221;) to purchase shares of our common stock. The Seller Notes are scheduled to mature on June 30
 2023 and may be
        converted into shares of our common stock at any time prior to the last business day immediately preceding the maturity date and shall be automatically converted into shares of our common stock upon an IPO. The conversion price is equal to the
        lower of $4.00 per share or the price at which the Common Stock was sold in an IPO. The Seller Warrants are exercisable any time from the date of issuance for up to 24 months from the date of the consummation of an IPO at an exercise price equal to

 conversion or exchange of convertible securities
 including for other securities
 will dilute the percentage ownership of our stockholders. The dilutive effect of the exercise or
        conversion of these securities may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital. The holders of these securities may be expected to exercise or convert such securities at a time when we would be able to obtain additional equity capital
        on terms more favorable than such securities or when our common stock is trading at a price higher than the exercise or conversion price of the securities. The exercise or conversion of outstanding securities will have a dilutive effect on the
        securities held by our shareholders. We have in the past
 and may in the future
 exchange outstanding securities for other securities on terms that are dilutive to the securities held by other shareholders not participating in such exchange.
      

 as of April 24
 2020
 (i) 6
536
586 warrants to purchase our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $3.52 per share that we issued in private placement offerings in December
        2018 and May 2019 are outstanding

 and (iii) 7

        options granted under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the &#8220;2019 Amended Plan&#8221;) to our executive officers and directors
 key employees and third-party contractors. The issuance of any such shares would ultimately be dilutive to the holders of shares

      
      
      

 without the approval of our stockholders
 one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations
 preferences
 limitations and
        relative rights
 including preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and distributions
 as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power
        or value of our common stock. For example
 we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events
 or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly
 the

      


      

 we incur significant legal
 accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition
 the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented
        by the SEC
 impose various requirements on public companies
 including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount
        of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover
 these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly
 particularly after we are no longer a smaller
        reporting company. For example

      


        

          
        


 we will be required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting
 including an attestation report on internal control over financial
        reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period
 we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting
        which is both costly and challenging. In this regard
 we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources
 potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over
        financial reporting
 continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate
 validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial
        reporting. Despite our efforts
 there is a risk that neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as

      

        Additionally

      

 these rules and regulations
 which are necessary to
        remain as a public reporting company
 will be costly because external third party consultant(s)
 attorneys

      

 and we may eventually need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting
        knowledge to have effective internal controls for financial reporting. Additionally
 due to the fact that our officers and directors have limited experience as an officer or director of a reporting company
 such lack of experience may impair our
        ability to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures
 which may result in material misstatements to our financial statements and an inability to provide accurate financial information to

      

 if we are not able to comply with the requirements or regulations as a public reporting company in any regard
 we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory
        authorities

      

 and with
 the reporting and disclosure obligations of publicly-traded companies in the United

      

 and with the reporting and disclosure obligations of publicly-traded companies
 and with serving as an officer and or director of a
        publicly-traded company. This lack of experience may impair our ability to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures
 which may result in material misstatements to our financial statements
        and an inability to provide accurate financial information to our stockholders. Consequently
 our operations
 future earnings and ultimate financial success could suffer irreparable harm due to our officers&#8217; and director&#8217;s ultimate lack of

      
      
      

        certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements
 which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. For example
 our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of
        directors to determine the rights
 preferences
 privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders. Thus
 our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with
        voting or conversion rights that could dilute the voting power of holders of our other series of capital stock. These rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company. Additionally
 our certificate of
        incorporation and/or bylaws establish limitations on the removal of directors and on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings and include advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for

      

 because we are incorporated in Delaware
 we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the &#8220;DGCL&#8221;)
 which prohibits an &#8220;interested
        stockholder&#8221; owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which such stockholder acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting
        stock

      


        

          
        


        stockholders
 which could limit our stockholders&#8217; ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors
 officers

      

 unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum
 the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will
 to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law
 be
        the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf
 (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer (or affiliate of any of the foregoing) of us to us or
        the our shareholders
 (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws
 or (iv) any other action asserting a claim arising under
 in connection with
 and governed by the
        internal affairs doctrine; provided that these exclusive forum provisions will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act
 or to any claim for which the federal courts have
        exclusive jurisdiction. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of
 and consented to
 the provisions of our bylaws described in the preceding sentence. This
        choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder&#8217;s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors
 officers
 employees or agents
 which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such
        persons. Alternatively
 if a court were to find these provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to
 or unenforceable in respect of
 one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings
 we may incur additional costs associated with resolving
        such matters in other jurisdictions
 which could adversely affect our business

Better Choice Company is a rapidly growing animal health and wellness company committed to leading the industry shift toward pet products and services that help dogs and cats live
          heathier
 happier and longer lives. We take an alternative
 nutrition-based approach to animal health relative to conventional dog and cat food offerings
 and position our portfolio of brands to benefit from the mainstream trends of growing pet
          humanization and consumer focus on health and wellness. We have a demonstrated
 multi-decade track record of success selling trusted animal health and wellness products
 and leverage our established digital footprint to provide pet parents with

 cat food and treats under the Halo and TruDog brands
 which are focused
 respectively
 on providing sustainably sourced kibble and
        canned food derived from real whole meat

      


 which we believe provides us with broad demographic exposure and appeal. We group these channels of trade into two distinct
        categories: retail-partner based (&#8220;Retail&#8221;)
 which includes the sale of product to e-commerce retailers
 pet specialty chains
 grocery
 mass and distributors
 and direct to consumer
 (&#8220;DTC&#8221;)
 which is focused on driving consumers to directly
        purchase product through our online web platform. With regard to our channels of trade
 the online purchase of pet food continues to take market share from brick and mortar retail
 with Packaged Facts reporting internet shopping growing from 7% of
        U.S. pet product sales in 2015 to 22% in 2019. We believe that the trend toward online shopping will continue
 and we will continue to reach a growing base of diverse customers through our DTC and e-commerce partner channels. Because our DTC
        strategy leverages one-on-one customer relationships and utilizes a targeted
 data-driven approach to reach customers
 we can gather valuable market and consumer behavior data that will allow our brands to be more competitive in the Retail channel.
        Conversely
 we believe Halo&#8217;s long-established relationships with key Retail customers will enable us to more effectively launch additional brands in the rapidly evolving retail environment. In addition
 Halo has successfully launched into high

      


 manufacture and commercialize new products generally in under 12 weeks. We will continue to deliver innovation to expand our
        product offerings and improve the health and well-being of pets. We leverage our proprietary behavioral database
 customer feedback and analytics capabilities to derive valuable insights and launch new products. We recently launched a line
        extension of our Halo brand to offer vegan alternatives for our customers. In addition to our domestic capabilities
 we have partnered with a leading Israeli research and development center

 Better
          Choice Company consummated the stock exchange transactions whereby TruPet LLC and Bona Vida

          each product batch to avoid any additional recalls.&#160; While we do not believe we lost customers because of the recalls
 we did incur additional shipping and customer service expenses to alleviate and avoid additional backlogs in product shipments
          caused by the recalls.&#160; We allowed products to be shipped from the manufacturing plants to the warehouse using truckloads not at full capacity
 or LTL
 which is more expensive than limiting our shipments to full-capacity truckloads.&#160; We separated
          customer orders into several shipments
 rather than waiting to fulfill entire orders as certain products were backlogged due to the recall. To address the additional strain on our customer service function
 we expanded the number and hours of our
          customer service representatives to help guide our customers through the recall process

        product to e-commerce retailers
 pet specialty chains
 grocery
 mass and distributors
 and DTC

      


        2019. The revenue channel percentage will change in 2020 with the acquisition of Halo
 as the Halo business is predominantly driven by the Retail channel. The majority of these sales transactions are single performance obligations that are recorded
        when control is transferred to the customer. DTC revenue is recognized at the time the order is shipped to the DTC customers. For the majority of Retail customers we recognize revenue when the product is shipped from our distribution centers
 when
        control transfers. For the remaining customers

      


 a portion of revenue is deferred at the time of the sale as points are earned based on the relative stand-alone selling price

        additional financing
 these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern
 meaning that we may be unable to continue operations for the foreseeable future or realize assets and discharge liabilities in the
        ordinary course of operations. The Company is implementing plans to achieve cost savings and other strategic objectives to address these conditions. We expect cost savings from consolidation of third-party manufacturers

 investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide
        additional funding on commercially reasonable terms or at all.&#160; If we are unable to raise the necessary funds when needed or achieve planned cost savings
 or other strategic objectives are not achieved
 we may not be able to continue our operations
        or we could be required to modify our operations that could slow future growth. The accompanying audited consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates the realization
        of assets and payments of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly

 TruPet along with the majority owners serving as co-borrowers entered into a line of credit providing for up to $2.0 million of borrowings secured by the personal assets of the two majority owners.
        Through various amendments
 the maximum borrowings under the credit facility increased to $4.6 million as of December 31
 2018
 with a maturity of May 2019. Borrowings bore interest at LIBOR plus 3% and were repaid on May 6
 2019. At December 31
        2018
 outstanding borrowings were $4.6 million 

      


 as noted above. Covenants under the line of credit required TruPet to be within certain restrictions. As of December 31
 2018
 TruPet was in
        compliance with its covenants.

 due to related party consisted of a $1.6 million unsecured note payable to a director of TruPet bearing 26.6% interest with principal and interest due within 30 days after change of control
 as
        described below.&#160; On May 6
 2019
 this loan was repaid. There was no accrued interest recorded at either December 31
 2018 or December 31

 Better Choice Company refinanced the $4.6 million credit facility and the $1.6 million note payable to a director with a $6.2 million revolving line of credit with a financial institution. The $6.2
        million revolving line of credit was secured by restricted cash held in a money market account. In connection with the consummation of the Halo Acquisition
 the Company terminated the $6.2 million revolving line of credit. Early termination of the
        revolving line of credit did not trigger any premiums or penalties

 which have been prepared in accordance with
        GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates
 assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets
 liabilities
 net sales
 costs and expenses and related
        disclosures. We believe that the estimates
 assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements and
 therefore
 we consider these to be our critical accounting
        policies. Accordingly
 we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. See &#8220;Note 1 &#8211; Nature of business and summary of significant
        accounting policies&#8221; to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our significant accounting policies as well as a description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and

      

      
      


 &#8220;Compensation &#8211; Stock Compensation&#8221;. We use the fair value method of accounting
        for awards granted to employees
 directors
 officers and consultants. Share-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date. We recognize compensation expense over the vesting period using

      


        

          
        


        of assumptions that are inputs into the model. These assumptions are the expected stock volatility
 the risk&#8211;free interest rate
 the expected life of the option and the expected dividend yield which is based on the historical dividends issued by
        the Company. Expected volatility is calculated based on the analysis of other public companies within the pet wellness
 internet commerce (e-commerce)
 and hemp derived CBD sectors. Risk&#8211;free interest rates are calculated based on risk&#8211;free rates
        for the appropriate term. The expected life is calculated as (i) the mid-point between the average vested date and the contractual expiration of the option for executives and directors and (ii) three years from the average vesting date for all
        others due to limited exercise history. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of equity&#8211;based payment awards requires the input of the subjective assumptions described above. The assumptions used in calculating
        the fair value of equity&#8211;based payment awards represent management&#8217;s best estimates

      

      
      


        value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We apply the framework for measuring fair value which requires a fair value
        hierarchy to be applied to all fair value measurements.&#160; The fair value of our warrant liability
 presented as &#8220;Warrant derivative liability&#8221; in the consolidated statements of operations
 is estimated using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The
        assumptions used in the model included the simulation of future stock prices based on future financing events
 likelihood of mandatory exercise of the warrants
 and timing and likelihood of fundamental transactions
 such as a change in control. The
        warrants include a reset function which is triggered if the Company issues or sells shares of common stock or common stock equivalents at a price per share that is less than the exercise price of the warrants. Subsequent to the issuance of the
        warrants
 additional common stock equivalents were awarded
 triggering the reset clause under the terms of the warrants. Accordingly
 the fair value analysis performed during the period ended December 31
 2019 included the impact of the trigger. As
        a result
 we recorded an adjustment to the derivative liability to reflect its fair value as of December 31

            These notes were valued on their respective issuance dates based on a risk-neutral Monte Carlo simulation-based approach. The stock price was simulated based on a Geometric Brownian Motion process
 The fair value analysis included assumptions about the probability of the occurrence of future events such as a change of control and initial public offering. See &#8220;Note 10 - Line of credit

        Company applies judgment in the determination of the amount of consideration the Company receives from its customers. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods. Revenue the
        Company recognizes varies with changes in trade incentives the Company offers to its customers and their consumers. Trade incentives consist primarily of customer pricing allowances and merchandising funds. Estimates of trade promotion expense and

        and estimate the fair values of intangible assets that should be recognized as assets apart from goodwill. A single estimate of fair value results from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and relies heavily on
        estimates and assumptions. We have historically relied in part upon the use of reports from third-party valuation specialists to assist in the estimation of fair values for intangible assets other than goodwill. The estimated fair values related to
        intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships and trademarks which are determined primarily using discounted cash flow models. Estimates in the discounted cash flow models include
 but are not limited to
 certain assumptions that
        form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g. revenue growth rates
 customer attrition rates
 and royalty rates). These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. The carrying values
        of acquired receivables and trade accounts payable have historically approximated their fair values at the business combination date. With respect to other acquired assets and liabilities

 with the participation of our chief executive officer (our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (our principal financial officer) evaluated the effectiveness of
        our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation
 and as a result of the material weaknesses described below
 our principal executive officer and principal
        financial officer concluded that
 as of December 31
 2019
 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Management anticipates that such disclosure controls and procedures will not be effective until the material weaknesses are

      


 the scope of management&#8217;s assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures did not include the internal controls over financial
        reporting of Halo
 which we acquired on December 19
 2019 and which represented approximately 85% of our consolidated assets and 4% of our consolidated revenues as of and for the year ended December 31
 2019

      

      
      

        internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projection of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or
        that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. In making this assessment
 management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control &#8211;
        Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on this assessment
 management concluded that
 as of December 31
 2019
 the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting was not effective
 due to the material weakness described below. A material
        weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be
        prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have identified the following material weaknesses
 as of December 31

      


          
            

            


 the Company does not have (i) segregation of duties and evidence of fiduciary oversight related to the financial statement close process
 cash
                disbursements process
 contract approval process and time and expense reimbursement process; (ii) formally documented accounting policies and procedures that are effective and consistently applied in accordance with GAAP; and (iii)





          
            

            


 including the secondary review and approval of financial information generated to prepare the consolidated financial statements
 and the lack of

 2019
 we completed the acquisition of Halo as described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Consistent with guidance
        issued by the SEC
 the scope of management&#8217;s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting did not include the internal controls over financial reporting of Halo
 which we acquired on December 19
 2019 and which
        represented approximately 85% of our consolidated assets and 4% of our consolidated revenues as of and for the year ended December 31

        solution into the direct to consumer platform to ensure accurate sales tax accruals. As part of our acquisition of Halo
 the existing Halo finance team will support the process of bringing current outsourced processes in house. There were no other

        for services rendered to the date of termination and any accrued but unpaid expenses required to be reimbursed under such employment agreement; (ii) a lump sum payment equal to executive&#8217;s target bonus for the year of termination

 the Company and Mr. Lelong entered into a six month employment agreement (the &#8220;Lelong Employment Agreement&#8221;). Under the terms of the Lelong Employment Agreement
 Mr. Lelong received a salary of
        $8

 beginning on the effective date of the Lelong Employment Agreement and every 30 days thereafter
 the Company paid Mr. Lelong the lesser of (i) $19
333

        owed to Mr. Lelong. Interest on any accrued salary amount remaining owed to Mr. Lelong accrued monthly at a rate of 18% per annum. As of December 31

 we owed Mr. Lelong $124
000 in accrued salary. Such amount has since been paid to Mr. Lelong
        in installments with the last payment being remitted to Mr. Lelong on August 9
 2019. Mr. Lelong resigned from his position as CEO on March 4

 Ms. Taylor and Mr. Santarsiero each received a signing bonus of $100
000
 $155

 respectively
 payable in a cash lump sum upon the execution of their respective NEO Employment Agreement.
        No annual bonuses were paid to any named executive officers for the fiscal year ended December 31

      
      
      

 equity-based incentive awards are to align the interests of our named executive officers and other employees
 nonemployee directors and consultants with the interests of our stockholders.
        Because vesting is based on continued employment

      

 execution of employment agreements and granting of awards under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the &#8220;2019 Plan&#8221;)
 we engaged Willis Towers Watson (&#8220;WTW&#8221;) to evaluate
        executive compensation packages for all of our senior employees. This included an evaluation of salary and equity award levels
 among other items. The analysis completed by WTW was performed to benchmark our company alongside public-market industry

      

 we use stock options as the primary incentive vehicles for long-term compensation. We
        believe that stock options are an effective tool for meeting our compensation goal of increasing long-term stockholder value by tying the value of the stock options to our future performance. The exercise price of each stock option grant is the
        fair market value of our common stock on the grant date

      

 2018
 Mr. Lelong received an equity award in the form of 19
231 stock options that vest in quarterly installments over a one-year period beginning on January 1
 2019
 subject to Mr. Lelong&#8217;s continuous

000 stock options
 respectively. Mr. Santarsiero was granted an additional 100

        2019. Mr. Schulmeyer was granted 500
000 options on June 29
 2019
 100

 2019
 250
000 options on December 11
 2019 and 20
371 options on December 31
 2019. In each case
 the stock options vest and become exercisable monthly
        over 2 years in equal installments of 1/24 each month
 subject to the executive&#8217;s continuous service with the Company through the vesting date(s). The stock options will be accelerated upon a termination without cause or for good reason within two

. We currently maintain a 401(k) retirement savings plan that allows eligible employees to contribute a portion of their compensation
 within limits prescribed
        by the Internal Revenue Code
 on a pre-tax basis through contributions to the plan. Our named executive officers are eligible to participate in the 401(k) plan. We believe that providing a vehicle for tax-deferred retirement savings through our
        401(k) plan adds to the overall desirability of our executive compensation package and further incentivizes our named executive officers in accordance with our compensation policies. The Company provides an employer matching contribution of 100% up

      

        

          
        

 All of our full-time employees
 including our named executive officers
 are eligible to participate in our employee benefit plans and
        programs
 including medical
 dental
 and vision benefits
 health spending accounts
 and long-term disability and life insurance
 to the same extent as our other full-time employees
 subject to the terms and eligibility requirements of those plans.
        During the term of Ms. Taylor&#8217;s NEO Employment Agreement
 we paid Ms. Taylor a monthly car allowance of $2

      
      
      

        executive officers&#8217; employment agreements entitles them to severance in the event of their termination without cause or their resignation for good reason (and
 for our named executive officers other than Mr. Lelong
 upon termination by reason of
        death or disability).&#160; In addition
 each named executive officer is entitled to accelerated vesting of all outstanding equity awards upon his or her termination without cause or their resignation for good reason within two years following a change
        in control of our Company. For additional discussion

        Standards&#8221;).&#160; Under the OTCQB Standards
 the Company is required to have a board of directors that includes at least two Independent Directors (as defined under the OTCQB Standards) and an audit committee
 a majority of the members of which are
        Independent Directors.&#160; An Independent Director is defined under the OTCQB Standards as a person other than an executive officer or employee of the Company or any other individual having a relationship which
 in the opinion of the Company&#8217;s board
        of directors
 would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities.&#160; Each of our directors other than Mr. Dalla-Longa as our former Chief Executive Officer
 Ms. Taylor as our former co-Chief Executive
        Officer and Mr. Word as the father of Ms. Taylor
 has been determined independent.&#160; Our Board has made a subjective determination that
 as to each of Messrs. Close
 Davis
 Gee and Young
 no relationships exist
 which
 in the opinion of our Board
        would interfere with such person&#8217;s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. In making these determinations
 our Board reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and management with

      

      
      


 except to the extent such exemption or limitation thereof is not permitted

      


          
            

            

              



      


        

          
        


          
            

            

              



      


          
            

            






      


          
            

            

              



      


 repeal or modification of these provisions will be prospective only and would not affect any limitation on liability of a director for acts or omissions that occurred prior to any such amendment
 repeal
        or modification. Our certificate of incorporation also requires us to pay any expenses incurred by any director or officer in defending against any such action
 suit or proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such matter to the fullest
        extent permitted by law
 subject to the receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized by our amended
        and restated bylaws or otherwise. We have entered indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers. These agreements require us to indemnify these individuals to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law against
        liability that may arise by reason of their service to us and to advance expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified. We believe that the limitation of liability provision in our certificate of

 and compliance with government regulations. In December 2019
 a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan
 China. Uncertainties regarding the
        economic impact of COVID-19
 the disease caused by the novel coronavirus
 are likely to result in sustained market turmoil
 which could also negatively impact our business
 financial condition
 and cash flows. The Company has incurred losses over
        the last three years and has an accumulated deficit. The Company continues to rely on current investors and the public markets to finance these losses through debt and/or equity issuance. These operating losses and the outstanding debt create
        substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the date these consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company is implementing plans to achieve cost savings and other
        strategic objectives to address these conditions. The Company expects cost savings from consolidation of third-party manufacturers
 optimizing shipping and warehousing as well as overhead cost reductions. The business is focused on growing the most
        profitable channels while reducing investments in areas that are expected to have long-term benefits. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates
        the realization of assets and payments of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly
 the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts

 and other
        relevant factors. Based on this analysis
 an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded. The provision for doubtful accounts is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company recorded less
        than $0.1 million allowance for doubtful accounts for the year ended December 31
 2019. For the year ended December 31

        amount of an asset may not be recoverable and any not expected to be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows are written down to current fair value. The Company acquired an intangible asset related to the Houndog license with the
        acquisition of Bona Vida an May 6
 2019. The Company fully impaired the asset as of December 31
 2019 as we terminated the contract on January 13
 2020. The Company acquired intangible assets with the acquisition of Halo on December 19
 2019. We
        will review impairment of the assets acquired beginning in the fiscal year ending on December 31

        implementation activities performed in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract.&#160; The amendments in this update align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service
        contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license).&#160; The accounting for the service element of a hosting
        arrangement that is a service contract is not affected by the amendments in this update.&#160; The amendments in this update also require the entity to present the expense related to the capitalized implementation costs in the same line item in the
        statement of income as the fees associated with the hosting element (service) of the arrangement and classify payments for capitalizing implementation costs in the statement of cash flows in the same manner as payments made for fees associated with
        the hosting element.&#160; The entity is also required to present the capitalized implementation costs in the statement of financial position in the same line item that a prepayment for the fees of the associated hosting arrangement would be presented.

 which recognizes that the fair value of an asset is premised upon the expected receipt of future economic benefits such
        as earnings and cash inflows based on current sales projections and estimated direct costs for each product line. Acquired customer relationships are finite-lived intangible assets and are amortized over their estimated life of 7 years using the

 which approximates the customer attrition rate

      


 and each major product is identified by this trade name. The trade name of the Company was valued on an income approach using a 2% royalty

 2018
 the U.S. Supreme Court rendered a 5-4 majority decision in South Dakota
        v. Wayfair Inc.
 17-494. Among other things
 the Court held that a state may require an out-of-state seller with no physical presence in the state to collect and remit sales taxes on goods the seller ships to consumers in the state
 overturning
        existing court precedent. The Company discovered that TruPet had not collected and paid sales tax related to all sales in some states where it had a physical presence.&#160; The Company recognized $1.2 million and no sales tax liability as of December
        31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.&#160; While additional assessments are not anticipated
 additional states may assert that the Company has nexus and must pay sales tax for prior sales.&#160; The Company does not believe that additional assessments
 if any

      


        

          
        


 2019
 the Company identified an error as of December 31
 2018 related to an understatement of
        sales taxes due and payable of $0.7 million. The error was corrected during the year ended December 31
 2019. The Company believes that the correction of this error is not material to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
        ended December 31

      

      
      


 2019
 the Company adopted the FASB guidance on leases (&#8220;Topic 842&#8221;)
 which requires leases with durations greater than twelve months to be recognized on the balance sheet. The Company adopted
        Topic 842 using the modified retrospective transition approach.&#160; Prior year financial statements were not recast under Topic 842
 and therefore those amounts are not disclosed. The Company has elected certain practical expedients
 including the
        package of practical expedients to not reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases
 lease classification and initial direct costs as well as an accounting policy to account for lease and non-lease components as a single
        component.&#160; The Company also elected the optional transition method that gives companies the option to use the effective date as the date of initial application on transition
 and as a result
 the Company did not adjust its comparative period
        financial information or make the new required lease disclosures for periods before the effective date. The Company has elected to make the accounting policy election for short-term leases. Consequently
 short-term leases are recorded as an expense

      


 the Company records the related asset and obligation at the present value of lease payments over the
        term. Lease renewal options are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use assets and right-of-use liabilities unless the Company is reasonably certain to exercise the optional renewal periods. The Company&#8217;s lease agreements do not contain
        any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.&#160; Additionally
 the Company&#8217;s leases contain rent escalations over the lease term and the Company recognizes expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease

      


 2019 related to the adoption of ASC 842
 Leases
 which resulted in an overstatement of less than $0.1 million for right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities
        respectively.&#160;&#160; The Company also identified an overstatement of Accumulated Deficit of less than $0.1 million as of January 1
 2019.&#160; The errors related to the impact upon adoption of ASC 842 were corrected during the twelve months ended December
        31
 2019.&#160; The Company believes the correction of these errors is not material to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the twelve months ended December 31

      


 the Company has elected the practical expedient allowed by the standard to account for all fixed consideration in a lease as a single
        lease component. Therefore

      


 the Company estimates the incremental borrowing discount rate based on information available at lease commencement.

 Better Choice Company entered into a licensing agreement with Authentic Brands and Elvis Presley Enterprises (&#8220;ABG&#8221;) whereby Better Choice was to sell newly developed hemp-derived CBD products that
        will be marketed under the Elvis Presley Houndog name.&#160; The license agreement required an upfront equity payment of $1.0 million worth of common stock. Upon the May Acquisitions on May 6
 2019
 the Company acquired the license agreement and

      


 2019
 the Company paid $0.6 million of the 2019-2020 agreed royalty payments. As there were no sales related to Houndog products during the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company determined that
        the minimum royalties paid during the year through December 31
 2019 should be expensed. The Houndog license agreement was terminated on January 13
 2020
 see &#8220;Note 22 - Subsequent events.&#8221; The Company recognized amortization expense of $0.1
        million and an impairment of the license intangible of $0.9 million as of and for the period ended December 31
 2019

 including lockdowns
 closures
 quarantines and travel bans intended to control the spread of the virus. Companies are also
        taking precautions
 such as requiring employees to work remotely

        impact on global economic conditions and consumer confidence and spending

 our
        ability to meet the demands of our customers may be materially impacted. To date
 we have not experienced any reduction in the available supply of our products. As of March 2020

          (x) the exercise price per share of such Award from (y) the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of such Award by (ii) the number of Shares with respect to which such Award shall have been exercised
 subject to any limitations the
          Administrator may impose.
      
&#8221; shall mean any entity (other than the Company)
 whether domestic or foreign
 in an
          unbroken chain of entities beginning with the Company if each of the entities other than the last entity in the unbroken chain beneficially owns
 at the time of the determination
 securities or interests representing at least fifty percent (50%)
          of the total combined voting power of all classes of securities or interests in one of the other entities in such chain.
      
&#8221; shall mean an Award granted under the Plan in
          connection with a corporate transaction
 such as a merger
 combination
 consolidation or acquisition of property or stock
 in any case
 upon the assumption of
 or in substitution for
 outstanding equity awards previously granted by a company or
          other entity; 
 
 that in no event shall the term &#8220;Substitute Award&#8221; be construed to refer to an award made in connection with the cancellation and repricing of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right.
      
&#8221; shall mean the date the Holder ceases to be an Eligible Individual.&#160; The
          Administrator
 in its sole discretion
 shall determine the effect of all matters and questions relating to any Termination of Service
 including
 without limitation
 whether a Termination of Service has occurred
 whether a Termination of Service
          resulted from a discharge for cause and all questions of whether particular leaves of absence constitute a Termination of Service; 
 
 that
 with respect to Incentive Stock Options
 unless the Administrator
          otherwise provides in the terms of any Program
 Award Agreement or otherwise
 or as otherwise required by Applicable Law
 a leave of absence
 change in status from an employee to an independent contractor or other change in the employee-employer
          relationship shall constitute a Termination of Service only if
 and to the extent that
 such leave of absence
 change in status or other change interrupts employment for the purposes of Section 422(a)(2) of the Code and the then-applicable
          regulations and revenue rulings under said Section. For purposes of the Plan
 a Holder&#8217;s employee-employer relationship or consultancy relations shall be deemed to be terminated in the event that the Subsidiary employing or contracting with such
          Holder ceases to remain an Subsidiary following any merger
 sale of stock or other corporate transaction or event (including
 without limitation
 a spin-off).
      


          

      
      
      
      
      
      
Subject to Sections 3.1(b) and 12.2
 Awards may be made under the Plan covering an aggregate number of
          Shares equal to the sum of: (i) 6
500
000
 (ii) an increase upon the Halo Closing of 2
500
000
 (iii) an increase upon the date immediately following the National Securities Listing Date if such National Securities Listing Date is on or prior to
          December 31
 2020
 equal to the lesser of (A) 10% of the Shares outstanding (on an as-converted basis) on the National Securities Listing Date and (B) such smaller number of Shares as determined by the Board and (iv) an annual increase on the
          first day of each calendar year beginning on January 1
 2021 and ending on and including January 1
 2029
 equal to the lesser of (A) 10% of the Shares outstanding (on an as-converted basis) on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year


 no more than 9
000
000 Shares may be issued upon the exercise of Incentive Stock Options. Any Shares distributed
          pursuant to an Award may consist
 in whole or in part
 of authorized and unissued Common Stock
 treasury Common Stock or Common Stock purchased on the open market.
      
If any Shares subject to an Award are forfeited or expire
 are converted to
          shares of another person in connection with a recapitalization
 reorganization
 merger
 consolidation
 split-up
 spin-off
 combination
 exchange of shares or other similar event
 or such Award is settled for cash (in whole or in part) (including
          Shares repurchased by the Company under Section 7.4 at the same price paid by the Holder)
 the Shares subject to such Award shall
 to the extent of such forfeiture
 expiration or cash settlement
 again be available for future grants of Awards
          under the Plan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein
 the following Shares shall not be added to the Shares authorized for grant under Section 3.1(a) and shall not be available for future grants of Awards: (i) Shares tendered
          by a Holder or withheld by the Company in payment of the exercise price of an Option; (ii) Shares tendered by the Holder or withheld by the Company to satisfy any tax withholding obligation with respect to an Award; (iii) Shares subject to a
          Stock Appreciation Right or other stock-settled Award&#160; (including Awards that may be settled in cash or stock) that are not issued in connection with the settlement or exercise
 as applicable
 of the Stock Appreciation Right or other
          stock-settled Award; and (iv) Shares purchased on the open market by the Company with the cash proceeds received from the exercise of Options. Any Shares repurchased by the Company under Section 7.4 at the same price paid by the Holder so that
          such Shares are returned to the Company shall again be available for Awards. The payment of Dividend Equivalents in cash in conjunction with any outstanding Awards shall not be counted against the Shares available for issuance under the Plan.
          Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 3.1(b)
 no Shares may again be optioned
 granted or awarded if such action would cause an Incentive Stock Option to fail to qualify as an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Code.
      
Substitute Awards may be granted on such terms as the Administrator deems appropriate
 notwithstanding
          limitations on Awards in the Plan.&#160; Substitute Awards shall not reduce the Shares authorized for grant under the Plan
 except as may be required by reason of Section 422 of the Code
 and Shares subject to such Substitute Awards shall not be added
          to the Shares available for Awards under the Plan as provided in Section 3.1(b) above. Additionally
 in the event that a company acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary or with which the Company or any Subsidiary combines has shares available
          under a pre-existing plan approved by its stockholders and not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition or combination
 the shares available for grant pursuant to the terms of such pre-existing plan (as adjusted
 to the extent appropriate
          using the exchange ratio or other adjustment or valuation ratio or formula used in such acquisition or combination to determine the consideration payable to the holders of common stock of the entities party to such acquisition or combination) may
          be used for Awards under the Plan and shall not reduce the Shares authorized for grant under the Plan (and Shares subject to such Awards shall not be added to the Shares available for Awards under the Plan as provided in Section 3.1(b) above); 
          that Awards using such available Shares shall not be made after the date awards or grants could have been made under the terms of the pre-existing plan
 absent the acquisition or combination
 and shall only be made to individuals who were not
          employed by or providing services to the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to such acquisition or combination.
      


          

      
      
      
      
. The Administrator may
 from time to time
 select
          from among all Eligible Individuals those to whom an Award shall be granted and shall determine the nature and amount of each Award
 which shall not be inconsistent with the requirements of the Plan. Except for any Non-Employee Director&#8217;s right
          to Awards that may be required pursuant to the Non-Employee Director Equity Compensation Policy as described in Section 4.6
 no Eligible Individual or other person shall have any right to be granted an Award pursuant to the Plan and neither the
          Company nor the Administrator is obligated to treat Eligible Individuals
 Holders or any other persons uniformly. Participation by each Holder in the Plan shall be voluntary and nothing in the Plan or any Program shall be construed as mandating
          that any Eligible Individual or other person shall participate in the Plan.
      
Each Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement
          that sets forth the terms
 conditions and limitations for such Award as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion (consistent with the requirements of the Plan and any applicable Program). Award Agreements evidencing Incentive Stock
          Options shall contain such terms and conditions as may be necessary to meet the applicable provisions of Section 422 of the Code. The Administrator
 in its sole discretion
 may grant Awards to Eligible Individuals that are based on one or more
          Performance Criteria or achievement of one or more Performance Goals or any such other criteria or goals as the Administrator shall establish.
      
. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan
 the
          Plan
 and any Award granted or awarded to any individual who is then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act
 shall be subject to any additional limitations set forth in any applicable exemptive rule under Section 16 of the Exchange Act
          (including Rule 16b&#8209;3 of the Exchange Act and any amendments thereto) that are requirements for the application of such exemptive rule. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law
 the Plan and Awards granted or awarded hereunder shall be deemed
          amended to the extent necessary to conform to such applicable exemptive rule.
      
. Nothing in the Plan or in any Program or Award
          Agreement hereunder shall confer upon any Holder any right to continue in the employ of
 or as a Director or Consultant for
 the Company or any Subsidiary
 or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Company and any
          Subsidiary
 which rights are hereby expressly reserved
 to discharge any Holder at any time for any reason whatsoever
 with or without cause
 and with or without notice
 or to terminate or change all other terms and conditions of employment or
          engagement
 except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between the Holder and the Company or any Subsidiary.
      


          

. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or applicable Program to the contrary
 in
          order to comply with the laws in countries other than the United States in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate or have Employees
 Non-Employee Directors or Consultants
 or in order to comply with the requirements of any foreign
          securities exchange or other Applicable Law
 the Administrator
 in its sole discretion
 shall have the power and authority to: (a) determine which Subsidiaries shall be covered by the Plan; (b) determine which Eligible Individuals outside the
          United States are eligible to participate in the Plan; (c) modify the terms and conditions of any Award granted to Eligible Individuals outside the United States to comply with Applicable Law (including
 without limitation
 applicable foreign
          laws or listing requirements of any foreign securities exchange); (d) establish subplans and modify exercise procedures and other terms and procedures
 to the extent such actions may be necessary or advisable; 
 
          that no such subplans and/or modifications shall increase the share limitation contained in Section 3.1; and (e) take any action
 before or after an Award is made
 that it deems advisable to obtain approval or comply with any necessary local
          governmental regulatory exemptions or approvals or listing requirements of any foreign securities exchange.
      
      
      
.&#160; The Administrator
 in its sole discretion
 may
&#8221;)
 subject to the limitations of
          the Plan. The Non-Employee Director Equity Compensation Policy shall set forth the type of Award(s) to be granted to Non-Employee Directors
 the number of Shares to be subject to Non-Employee Director Awards
 the conditions on which such Awards
          shall be granted
 become exercisable and/or payable and expire
 and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator shall determine in its sole discretion. The Non-Employee Director Equity Compensation Policy may be modified by the
          Administrator from time to time in its sole discretion and pursuant to the exercise of its business judgment
 taking into account such factors
 circumstances and considerations as it shall deem relevant from time to time.
      
      
      
      
      
.
          The Administrator is authorized to grant Options and Stock Appreciation Rights to Eligible Individuals from time to time
 in its sole discretion
 on such terms and conditions as it may determine
 which shall not be inconsistent with the Plan
          including any limitations in the Plan that apply to Incentive Stock Options.
      


          

The
        Administrator may grant Options intended to qualify as Incentive Stock Options only to employees of the Company
 any of the Company&#8217;s present or future &#8220;parent corporations&#8221; or &#8220;subsidiary corporations&#8221; as defined in Sections 424(e) or (f) of the
        Code
 respectively

To the extent that the aggregate fair market value
          of stock with respect to which &#8220;incentive stock options&#8221; (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code
 but without regard to Section 422(d) of the Code) are exercisable for the first time by a Holder during any calendar year under the Plan
 and
          all other plans of the Company and any parent corporation or subsidiary corporation thereof (as defined in Section 424(e) and 424(f) of the Code
 respectively)
 exceeds $100
000
 the Options shall be treated as Non-Qualified Stock Options to the
          extent required by Section 422 of the Code. The rule set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall be applied by taking Options and other &#8220;incentive stock options&#8221; into account in the order in which they were granted and the fair market

        the Company nor the Administrator shall have any liability to a Holder
 or any other person
 (a) if an Option (or any part thereof) which is intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option fails to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option or (b) for
        any action or omission by the Company or the Administrator that causes an Option not to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option
 including
 without limitation
 the conversion of an Incentive Stock Option to a Non-Qualified Stock Option or the grant of
        an Option intended as an Incentive Stock Option that fails to satisfy the requirements under the Code applicable to an Incentive Stock Option.
      
. The exercise price per Share subject to each
          Option and Stock Appreciation Right shall be set by the Administrator
 but shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Option or Stock Appreciation Right
 as applicable
 is granted (or
 as to Incentive Stock
          Options
 on the date the Option is modified
 extended or renewed for purposes of Section 424(h) of the Code). In addition
 in the case of Incentive Stock Options granted to a Greater Than 10% Stockholder
 such price shall not be less than 110% of
          the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Option is granted (or the date the Option is modified
 extended or renewed for purposes of Section 424(h) of the Code). Notwithstanding the foregoing
 in the case of an Option or Stock Appreciation
          Right that is a Substitute Award
 the exercise price per share of the Shares subject to such Option or Stock Appreciation Right
 as applicable
 that the
          exercise price of any Substitute Award shall be determined in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 424 and 409A of the Code.
      
&#8221;) and the term of each Stock
          Appreciation Right (the &#8220;
 
 that the Option Term or SAR Term
 as applicable

          Option or Stock Appreciation Right
 as applicable

 or (b) five (5) years from the date an Incentive Stock Option is granted to a Greater Than 10% Stockholder.
          Except as limited by the requirements of Section 409A or Section 422 of the Code and regulations and rulings thereunder or the first sentence of this Section 5.4 and without limiting the Company&#8217;s rights under Section 10.7
 the Administrator may
          extend the Option Term of any outstanding Option or the SAR Term of any outstanding Stock Appreciation Right
 and may extend the time period during which vested Options or Stock Appreciation Rights may be exercised
 in connection with any
          Termination of Service of the Holder or otherwise
 and may amend
 subject to Section 10.7 and 12.1
 any other term or condition of such Option or Stock Appreciation Right relating to such Termination of Service of the Holder or otherwise.
      


          

.&#160; The period during which the right to exercise
 in whole or in part
 an
          Option or Stock Appreciation Right vests in the Holder shall be set by the Administrator and set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing and unless determined otherwise by the Company
 in the event that on the last
          business day of the term of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right (other than an Incentive Stock Option) (a) the exercise of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right is prohibited by Applicable Law
 as determined by the Company
 or (b) Shares may
          not be purchased or sold by the applicable Participant due to any Company insider trading policy (including blackout periods) or a &#8220;lock-up&#8221; agreement undertaken in connection with an issuance of securities by the Company
 the term of the Option
          or Stock Appreciation Right shall be extended until the date that is thirty (30) days after the end of the legal prohibition
 black-out period or lock-up agreement
 as determined by the Company; provided
 however
 in no event shall the extension
          last beyond the ten year term of the applicable Option or Stock Appreciation Right.&#160; Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator in the Award Agreement
 the applicable Program or by action of the Administrator following the grant of the
          Option or Stock Appreciation Right
 (i) no portion of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right which is unexercisable at a Holder&#8217;s Termination of Service shall thereafter become exercisable and (ii) the portion of an Option or Stock Appreciation
          Right that is unexercisable at a Holder&#8217;s Termination of Service shall automatically expire on the date of such Termination of Service.
      
      
      
      
      
. An exercisable Option or Stock Appreciation Right
          may be exercised in whole or in part. However
 unless the Administrator otherwise determines
 an Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall not be exercisable with respect to fractional Shares and the Administrator may require that
 by the terms of
          the Option or Stock Appreciation Right
 a partial exercise must be with respect to a minimum number of Shares. Payment of the amounts payable with respect to Stock Appreciation Rights pursuant to this Article 6 shall be in cash
 Shares (based on
          its Fair Market Value as of the date the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised)
 or a combination of both
 as determined by the Administrator.
      
. All or a portion of an exercisable Option or Stock
          Appreciation Right shall be deemed exercised upon delivery of all of the following to the Secretary of the Company
 the stock plan administrator of the Company or such other person or entity designated by the Administrator
 or his
 her or its
          office
 as applicable:
      
A written notice of exercise in a form the Administrator approves (which may be electronic) complying with
          the applicable rules established by the Administrator. The notice shall be signed or otherwise acknowledge electronically by the Holder or other person then entitled to exercise the Option or Stock Appreciation Right or such portion thereof;
      
Such representations and documents as the Administrator
 in its sole discretion
 deems necessary or
          advisable to effect compliance with Applicable Law.
      


          

In the event that the Option shall be exercised pursuant to Section 10.3 by any person or persons other
          than the Holder
 appropriate proof of the right of such person or persons to exercise the Option or Stock Appreciation Right
 as determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator; and
      
Full payment of the exercise price and applicable withholding taxes for the Shares with respect to which
          the Option or Stock Appreciation Right
 or portion thereof
 is exercised
 in a manner permitted by the Administrator in accordance with Sections 10.1 and 10.2.
      
. The Holder shall give the Company prompt written or electronic notice of any disposition or other transfers (other than in connection with a Change in Control) of Shares acquired by exercise of an Incentive Stock Option which occurs within
          (a) two years from the date of granting (including the date the Option is modified
 extended or renewed for purposes of Section 424(h) of the Code) such Option to such Holder
 or (b) one year after the date of transfer of such Shares to such

 in cash
 other property
 assumption of indebtedness or other consideration

      
      
      
      
      
. The Administrator is authorized to grant
          Restricted Stock
 or the right to purchase Restricted Stock
 to Eligible Individuals
 and shall determine the terms and conditions
 including the restrictions applicable to each award of Restricted Stock
 which terms and conditions shall not be
          inconsistent with the Plan or any applicable Program
 and may impose such conditions on the issuance of such Restricted Stock as it deems appropriate. The Administrator shall establish the purchase price
 if any
 and form of payment for
          Restricted Stock; 
 
 that if a purchase price is charged
 such purchase price shall be no less than the par value
 if any
 of the Shares to be purchased
 unless otherwise permitted by Applicable Law. In all cases
          legal consideration shall be required for each issuance of Restricted Stock to the extent required by Applicable Law.
      
.
          Subject to Section 7.4
 upon issuance of Restricted Stock
 the Holder shall have
 unless otherwise provided by the Administrator
 all of the rights of a stockholder with respect to said Shares
 subject to the restrictions in the Plan
 any
          applicable Program and/or the applicable Award Agreement

        that is on or after the date on which the Holder to whom such Restricted Stock are granted becomes the record holder of such Restricted Stock
 
 that
 in the sole discretion of the Administrator
 any extraordinary dividends or distributions with respect to
          the Shares may be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 7.3. In addition
 notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein
 with respect to a share of Restricted Stock
 dividends which are paid prior to vesting shall only be paid out to
          the Holder to the extent that the share of Restricted Stock vests.
      


          

. All shares of Restricted Stock (including any shares
          received by Holders thereof with respect to shares of Restricted Stock as a result of stock dividends
 stock splits or any other form of recapitalization) and
 unless the Administrator provides otherwise
 any property (other than cash)
          transferred to Holders in connection with an extraordinary dividend or distribution shall be subject to such restrictions and vesting requirements as the Administrator shall provide in the applicable Program or Award Agreement.
      
. Except as otherwise
          determined by the Administrator
 if no price was paid by the Holder for the Restricted Stock
 upon a Termination of Service during the applicable restriction period
 the Holder&#8217;s rights in unvested Restricted Stock then subject to restrictions
          shall lapse
 and such Restricted Stock shall be surrendered to the Company and cancelled without consideration on the date of such Termination of Service. If a price was paid by the Holder for the Restricted Stock
 upon a Termination of Service
          during the applicable restriction period
 the Company shall have the right to repurchase from the Holder the unvested Restricted Stock then subject to restrictions at a cash price per share equal to the price paid by the Holder for such
          Restricted Stock or such other amount as may be specified in the applicable Program or Award Agreement.
      
. If a Holder makes an election under Section
          83(b) of the Code to be taxed with respect to the Restricted Stock as of the date of transfer of the Restricted Stock rather than as of the date or dates upon which the Holder would otherwise be taxable under Section 83(a) of the Code
 the Holder
          shall be required to deliver a copy of such election to the Company promptly after filing such election with the Internal Revenue Service along with proof of the timely filing thereof with the Internal Revenue Service.
      
      
      
      
      
. The Administrator is authorized to grant Awards of Restricted Stock
          Units to any Eligible Individual selected by the Administrator in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as determined by the Administrator.&#160; A Holder will have no rights of a stockholder with respect to Shares subject to any
          Restricted Stock Unit unless and until the Shares are delivered in settlement of the Restricted Stock Unit.
      
. At the time of grant
 the Administrator shall specify the date or
          dates on which the Restricted Stock Units shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable
 and may specify such conditions to vesting as it deems appropriate
 including
 without limitation
 vesting based upon the Holder&#8217;s duration of service to the
          Company or any Subsidiary
 one or more Performance Goals or other specific criteria
 in each case on a specified date or dates or over any period or periods
 as determined by the Administrator. An Award of Restricted Stock Units shall only be
          eligible to vest while the Holder is an Employee
 a Consultant or a Director
 as applicable; 
 
 that the Administrator
 in its sole discretion
 may provide (in an Award Agreement or otherwise) that a Restricted
          Stock Unit award may become vested subsequent to a Termination of Service in the event of the occurrence of certain events
 including a Change in Control
 the Holder&#8217;s death
 retirement or disability or any other specified Termination of Service
          subject to Section 11.7.
      


          

. At the time of grant
 the Administrator shall specify the maturity date
          applicable to each grant of Restricted Stock Units
 that
          except as otherwise determined by the Administrator
 and subject to compliance with Section 409A
 day of the third
 day of the third month following the end of the Company&#8217;s fiscal year in which the applicable portion of
          the Restricted Stock Unit vests. On the maturity date
 the Company shall
 in accordance with the applicable Award Agreement and subject to Section 10.4(f)
 transfer to the Holder one unrestricted
 fully transferable Share for each Restricted
          Stock Unit scheduled to be paid out on such date and not previously forfeited
 or in the sole discretion of the Administrator
 an amount in cash equal to the Fair Market Value of such Shares on the maturity date or a combination of cash and
          Common Stock as determined by the Administrator.
      
      
      
      
      
.&#160; The Administrator is authorized to
          grant Other Stock or Cash Based Awards
 including awards entitling a Holder to receive Shares or cash to be delivered immediately or in the future
 to any Eligible Individual. Subject to the provisions of the Plan and any applicable Program
 the
          Administrator shall determine the terms and conditions of each Other Stock or Cash Based Award
 including the term of the Award
 any exercise or purchase price
 Performance Criteria and Performance Goals
 transfer restrictions
 vesting conditions
          and other terms and conditions applicable thereto
 which shall be set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. Other Stock or Cash Based Awards may be paid in cash
 Shares
 or a combination of cash and Shares
 as determined by the Administrator
          and may be available as a form of payment in the settlement of other Awards granted under the Plan
 as stand-alone payments
 as a part of a bonus
 deferred bonus
 deferred compensation or other arrangement
 and/or as payment in lieu of
          compensation to which an Eligible Individual is otherwise entitled.
      
. Dividend Equivalents may be granted by the
          Administrator
 either alone or in tandem with another Award
 based on dividends declared on the Common Stock
 to be credited as of dividend payment dates during the period between the date the Dividend Equivalents are granted to a Holder and the
          date such Dividend Equivalents terminate or expire
 as determined by the Administrator. Such Dividend Equivalents shall be converted to cash or additional Shares by such formula and at such time and subject to such restrictions and limitations as
          may be determined by the Administrator. In addition
 Dividend Equivalents with respect to an Award that are based on dividends paid prior to the vesting of such Award shall only be paid out to the Holder to the extent that the vesting conditions
          are subsequently satisfied and the Award vests. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 no Dividend Equivalents shall be payable with respect to Options or Stock Appreciation Rights.
      


          

      
      
      
      
. The Administrator shall determine the method or methods by
          which payments by any Holder with respect to any Awards granted under the Plan shall be made
 including
 without limitation: (a) cash
 wire transfer of immediately available funds or check
 (b) Shares (including
 in the case of payment of the
          exercise price of an Award
 Shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of the Award) or Shares held for such minimum period of time as may be established by the Administrator
 in each case
 having a Fair Market Value on the date of delivery equal
          to the aggregate payments required
 (c) delivery of a written or electronic notice that the Holder has placed a market sell order with a broker acceptable to the Company with respect to Shares then issuable upon exercise or vesting of an Award
 that payment of such proceeds is then made to the Company upon
          settlement of such sale
 (d) other form of legal consideration acceptable to the Administrator in its sole discretion
 or (e) any combination of the above permitted forms of payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the
          contrary
 no Holder who is a Director or an &#8220;executive officer&#8221; of the Company within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act shall be permitted to make payment with respect to any Awards granted under the Plan
 or continue any extension
          of credit with respect to such payment
 with a loan from the Company or a loan arranged by the Company in violation of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act.
      
. The Company or any Subsidiary shall have the authority and the right to deduct or
          withhold
 or require a Holder to remit to the Company
 an amount sufficient to satisfy federal
 state
 local and foreign taxes (including the Holder&#8217;s FICA
 employment tax or other social security contribution obligation) required by law to be
          withheld with respect to any taxable event concerning a Holder arising as a result of the Plan or any Award. The Administrator may
 in its sole discretion and in satisfaction of the foregoing requirement
 or in satisfaction of such additional
          withholding obligations as a Holder may have elected
 allow a Holder to satisfy such obligations by any payment means described in Section 10.1 hereof
 including without limitation
 by allowing such Holder to elect to have the Company or any
          Subsidiary withhold Shares otherwise issuable under an Award (or allow the surrender of Shares). The number of Shares that may be so withheld or surrendered shall be limited to the number of Shares that have a fair market value on the date of
          withholding or repurchase no greater than the aggregate amount of such liabilities based on the maximum statutory withholding rates in such Holder&#8217;s applicable jurisdictions for federal
 state
 local and foreign income tax and payroll tax
          purposes that are applicable to such taxable income. The Administrator shall determine the fair market value of the Shares
 consistent with applicable provisions of the Code
 for tax withholding obligations due in connection with a
          broker-assisted cashless Option or Stock Appreciation Right exercise involving the sale of Shares to pay the Option or Stock Appreciation Right exercise price or any tax withholding obligation.
      


          

      
      
      
      
No Award under the Plan may be sold
 pledged
 assigned or transferred in any
          manner other than (A) by will or the laws of descent and distribution or (B) subject to the consent of the Administrator
 pursuant to a DRO
 unless and until such Award has been exercised or the Shares underlying such Award have been issued
 and
          all restrictions applicable to such Shares have lapsed;
      
No Award or interest or right therein shall be liable for or otherwise subject to the debts
 contracts or
          engagements of the Holder or the Holder&#8217;s successors in interest or shall be subject to disposition by transfer
 alienation
 anticipation
 pledge
 hypothecation
 encumbrance
 assignment or any other means whether such disposition be voluntary or
          involuntary or by operation of law by judgment
 levy
 attachment
 garnishment or any other legal or equitable proceedings (including bankruptcy) unless and until such Award has been exercised
 or the Shares underlying such Award have been issued
          and all restrictions applicable to such Shares have lapsed
 and any attempted disposition of an Award prior to satisfaction of these conditions shall be null and void and of no effect
 except to the extent that such disposition is permitted by
          Section 10.3(a)(i); and
      
During the lifetime of the Holder
 only the Holder may exercise any exercisable portion of an Award
          granted to such Holder under the Plan
 unless it has been disposed of pursuant to a DRO.&#160; After the death of the Holder
 any exercisable portion of an Award may
 prior to the time when such portion becomes unexercisable under the Plan or the
          applicable Program or Award Agreement
 be exercised by the Holder&#8217;s personal representative or by any person empowered to do so under the deceased Holder&#8217;s will or under the then-applicable laws of descent and distribution.
      
Notwithstanding Section 10.3(a)
 the Administrator
 in its sole discretion
 may determine to permit a
          Holder or a Permitted Transferee of such Holder to transfer an Award other than an Incentive Stock Option (unless such Incentive Stock Option is intended to become a Nonqualified Stock Option) to any one or more Permitted Transferees of such
          Holder
 subject to the following terms and conditions: (i) an Award transferred to a Permitted Transferee shall not be assignable or transferable by the Permitted Transferee other than (A) to another Permitted Transferee of the applicable Holder
          or (B) by will or the laws of descent and distribution or
 subject to the consent of the Administrator
 pursuant to a DRO; (ii) an Award transferred to a Permitted Transferee shall continue to be subject to all the terms and conditions of the
          Award as applicable to the original Holder (other than the ability to further transfer the Award to any person other than another Permitted Transferee of the applicable Holder); (iii) the Holder (or transferring Permitted Transferee) and the
          receiving Permitted Transferee shall execute any and all documents requested by the Administrator
 including
 without limitation documents to (A) confirm the status of the transferee as a Permitted Transferee
 (B) satisfy any requirements for an
          exemption for the transfer under Applicable Law and (C) evidence the transfer; and (iv) the transfer of an Award to a Permitted Transferee shall be without consideration.&#160; In addition
 and further notwithstanding Section 10.3(a)
 hereof
 the
          Administrator
 in its sole discretion
 may determine to permit a Holder to transfer Incentive Stock Options to a trust that constitutes a Permitted Transferee if
 under Section 671 of the Code and other Applicable Law
 the Holder is considered
          the sole beneficial owner of the Incentive Stock Option while it is held in the trust.
      


          

Notwithstanding Section 10.3(a)
 a Holder may
 in the manner determined by the Administrator
 designate a
          beneficiary to exercise the rights of the Holder and to receive any distribution with respect to any Award upon the Holder&#8217;s death. A beneficiary
 legal guardian
 legal representative
 or other person claiming any rights pursuant to the Plan is
          subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and any Program or Award Agreement applicable to the Holder and any additional restrictions deemed necessary or appropriate by the Administrator. If the Holder is married or a domestic partner in a
          domestic partnership qualified under Applicable Law and resides in a community property state
 a designation of a person other than the Holder&#8217;s spouse or domestic partner
 as applicable
 as the Holder&#8217;s beneficiary with respect to more than 50%
          of the Holder&#8217;s interest in the Award shall not be effective without the prior written or electronic consent of the Holder&#8217;s spouse or domestic partner. If no beneficiary has been designated or survives the Holder
 payment shall be made to the
          person entitled thereto pursuant to the Holder&#8217;s will or the laws of descent and distribution. Subject to the foregoing
 that the change or revocation
          is delivered in writing to the Administrator prior to the Holder&#8217;s death.
      
      
      
The Administrator shall determine the methods by which Shares shall be delivered or deemed to be delivered
          to Holders. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary
 the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any certificates or make any book entries evidencing Shares pursuant to the exercise of any Award
 unless and until the
          Administrator has determined that the issuance of such Shares is in compliance with Applicable Law and the Shares are covered by an effective registration statement or applicable exemption from registration. In addition to the terms and
          conditions provided herein
 the Administrator may require that a Holder make such reasonable covenants
 agreements and representations as the Administrator
 in its sole discretion
 deems advisable in order to comply with Applicable Law.
      
All share certificates delivered pursuant to the Plan and all Shares issued pursuant to book entry
          procedures are subject to any stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Administrator deems necessary or advisable to comply with Applicable Law. The Administrator may place legends on any share certificate or book entry to reference
          restrictions applicable to the Shares (including
 without limitation
 restrictions applicable to Restricted Stock).
      
The Administrator shall have the right to require any Holder to comply with any timing or other
          restrictions with respect to the settlement
 distribution or exercise of any Award
 including a window-period limitation
 as may be imposed in the sole discretion of the Administrator.
      
Unless the Administrator otherwise determines
 no fractional Shares shall be issued and the Administrator
          in its sole discretion
 shall determine whether cash shall be given in lieu of fractional Shares or whether such fractional Shares shall be eliminated by rounding down.
      


          

The Company
 in its sole discretion
 may (i) retain physical possession of any stock certificate evidencing
          Shares until any restrictions thereon shall have lapsed and/or (ii) require that the stock certificates evidencing such Shares be held in custody by a designated escrow agent (which may but need not be the Company) until the restrictions thereon
          shall have lapsed
 and that the Holder deliver a stock power
 endorsed in blank
 relating to such Shares.
      
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan
 unless otherwise determined by the Administrator or
          required by Applicable Law
 the Company shall not deliver to any Holder certificates evidencing Shares issued in connection with any Award and instead such Shares shall be recorded in the books of the Company (or
 as applicable
 its transfer
          agent or stock plan administrator).
      
All Awards
        (including any proceeds
 gains or other economic benefit actually or constructively received by a Holder upon any receipt or exercise of any Award or upon the receipt or resale of any Shares underlying the Award and any payments of a portion of an
        incentive-based bonus pool allocated to a Holder) shall be subject to the provisions of any claw-back policy implemented by the Company
 including
 without limitation
 any claw-back policy adopted to comply with the requirements of Applicable Law
        including
 without limitation
 the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder
 whether or not such claw-back policy was in place at the time of grant of an Award
 to the extent set

      
. Subject to Section 12.2 and following the National Securities
          Listing Date
 the Administrator shall not
 without the approval of the stockholders of the Company
 (a) authorize the amendment of any outstanding Option or Stock Appreciation Right to reduce its price per Share
 or (b) cancel any Option or Stock
          Appreciation Right in exchange for cash or another Award when the Option or Stock Appreciation Right price per Share exceeds the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares.
      
.&#160; Subject to Applicable Law
 the Administrator may amend
 modify or terminate any outstanding Award
 including but
        not limited to
 substituting therefor another Award of the same or a different type
 changing the date of exercise or settlement
 and converting an Incentive Stock Option to a Non-Qualified Stock Option.&#160; The Holder&#8217;s consent to such action shall
        be required unless (a) the Administrator determines that the action
 taking into account any related action
 would not materially and adversely affect the Holder

 without
        limitation

          Company registration statement filed under the Securities Act
 or such longer period as determined by the underwriter. In order to enforce the foregoing
 the Company shall have the right to place restrictive legends on the certificates of any
          securities of the Company held by the Holder and to impose stop transfer instructions with the Company&#8217;s transfer agent with respect to any securities of the Company held by the Holder until the end of such period.

 or a parent or subsidiary
          thereof
 or shall be substituted for by similar options
 rights or awards covering the stock of the successor or survivor corporation
 or a parent or subsidiary thereof
 with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and
          applicable exercise or purchase price
 in all cases
 as determined by the Administrator;
      
To make adjustments in the number and type of Shares of the Company&#8217;s stock (or other securities or
          property) subject to outstanding Awards
 and/or in the terms and conditions of (including the grant or exercise price)
 and the criteria included in
 outstanding Awards and Awards which may be granted in the future;
      


          

To provide that such Award shall be exercisable or payable or fully vested with respect to all Shares
          covered thereby
 notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan or the applicable Program or Award Agreement;
      
      
      
To provide that the Award cannot vest
 be exercised or become payable after such event.
      
In connection with the occurrence of any Equity Restructuring
 and notwithstanding anything to the
          contrary in Sections 12.2(a) and 12.2(b):
      
The number and type of securities subject to each outstanding Award and the
          exercise price or grant price thereof
 if applicable
 shall be equitably adjusted (and the adjustments provided under this Section 12.2(c)(i) shall be nondiscretionary and shall be final and binding on the affected Holder and the Company); and/or
      
The Administrator shall make such equitable adjustments
 if any
 as the Administrator
 in its sole
          discretion
 may deem appropriate to reflect such Equity Restructuring with respect to the aggregate number and kind of Shares that may be issued under the Plan (including
 but not limited to
 adjustments of the limitation in Section 3.1 on the
          maximum number and kind of Shares which may be issued under the Plan).
      
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan
 in the event of a Change in Control
 unless the
          Administrator elects to (i) terminate an Award in exchange for cash
 rights or property
 or (ii) cause an Award to become fully exercisable and no longer subject to any forfeiture restrictions prior to the consummation of a Change in Control
          pursuant to Section 12.2
 (A) such Award (other than any portion subject to performance-based vesting) shall continue in effect or be assumed or an equivalent Award (which may include
 without limitation
 an Award settled in cash) substituted by
          the successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of the successor corporation and (B) the portion of such Award subject to performance-based vesting shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Award Agreement and
 in the
          absence of applicable terms and conditions
 the Administrator&#8217;s discretion. In the event an Award continues in effect or is assumed or an equivalent Award substituted
 and a Holder incurs a Termination of Service without &#8220;cause&#8221; (as such term is
          defined in the sole discretion of the Administrator
 or as set forth in the Award Agreement relating to such Award) upon or within twelve (12) months following the Change in Control
 then such Holder shall be fully vested in such continued
          assumed or substituted Award.
      
In the event that the successor corporation in a Change in Control refuses to assume or substitute for an
          Award (other than any portion subject to performance-based vesting)
 the Administrator may cause (i) any or all of such Award (or portion thereof) to terminate in exchange for cash
 rights or other property pursuant to Section 12.2(b)(i) or (ii)
          any or all of such Award (or portion thereof) to become fully exercisable immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction and all forfeiture restrictions on any or all of such Award to lapse. If any such Award is exercisable in lieu of
          assumption or substitution in the event of a Change in Control
 the Administrator shall notify the Holder that such Award shall be fully exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice
 contingent upon the occurrence of
          the Change in Control
 and such Award shall terminate upon the expiration of such period.
      


          

For the purposes of this Section 12.2
 an Award shall be considered assumed if
 following the Change in
          Control
 the Award confers the right to purchase or receive
 for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the Change in Control
 the consideration (whether stock
 cash
 or other securities or property) received in the Change in
          Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration
 the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); 
          
 that if such consideration received in the Change in Control was not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its parent
 the Administrator may
 with the consent of the successor corporation
 provide for the
          consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Award
 for each Share subject to an Award
 to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its parent equal in fair market value to the per-share consideration received by holders of
          Common Stock in the Change in Control.
      
The Administrator
 in its sole discretion
 may include such further provisions and limitations in any
          Award
 agreement or certificate
 as it may deem equitable and in the best interests of the Company that are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan.
      
Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator
 no adjustment or action described in this Section 12.2 or
          in any other provision of the Plan shall be authorized to the extent it would (i) cause the Plan to violate Section 422(b)(1) of the Code
 (ii) result in short-swing profits liability under Section 16 of the Exchange Act or violate the exemptive
          conditions of Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act
 or (iii) cause an Award to fail to be exempt from or comply with Section 409A.
      
The existence of the Plan
 any Program
 any Award Agreement and/or the Awards granted hereunder shall not
          affect or restrict in any way the right or power of the Company or the stockholders of the Company to make or authorize any adjustment
 recapitalization
 reorganization or other change in the Company&#8217;s capital structure or its business
 any
          merger or consolidation of the Company
 any issue of stock or of options
 warrants or rights to purchase stock or of bonds
 debentures
 preferred or prior preference stocks whose rights are superior to or affect the Common Stock or the rights
          thereof or which are convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock
 or the dissolution or liquidation of the Company
 or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business
 or any other corporate act or proceeding
 whether of a
          similar character or otherwise.
      
 In the event of any pending stock dividend
 stock split
 combination or exchange of shares
 merger
          consolidation or other distribution (other than normal cash dividends) of Company assets to stockholders
 or any other change affecting the Shares or the share price of the Common Stock including any Equity Restructuring
 for reasons of
          administrative convenience
 the Administrator
 in its sole discretion
 may refuse to permit the exercise of any Award during a period of up to thirty (30) days prior to the consummation of any such transaction.
      


          

. The Plan shall be submitted for the
 that such Awards shall not be
          exercisable
 shall not vest and the restrictions thereon shall not lapse and no Shares shall be issued pursuant thereto prior to the time when the Plan is approved by the Company&#8217;s stockholders; and 
 
 that if such
          approval has not been obtained at the end of said twelve (12) month period
 all Awards previously granted or awarded under the Plan shall thereupon be canceled and become null and void.
      
. Except as otherwise provided herein or in an
          applicable Program or Award Agreement
 a Holder shall have none of the rights of a stockholder with respect to Shares covered by any Award until the Holder becomes the record owner of such Shares.
      
. In the event that the Company establishes
 for itself or using the
          services of a third party
 an automated system for the documentation
 granting or exercise of Awards
 such as a system using an internet website or interactive voice response
 then the paperless documentation
 granting or exercise of Awards by a
          Holder may be permitted through the use of such an automated system.
      
. The adoption of the Plan shall not affect any other
          compensation or incentive plans in effect for the Company or any Subsidiary. Nothing in the Plan shall be construed to limit the right of the Company or any Subsidiary: (a) to establish any other forms of incentives or compensation for Employees
          Directors or Consultants of the Company or any Subsidiary
 or (b) to grant or assume options or other rights or awards otherwise than under the Plan in connection with any proper corporate purpose including without limitation
 the grant or
          assumption of options in connection with the acquisition by purchase
 lease
 merger
 consolidation or otherwise
 of the business
 stock or assets of any corporation
 partnership
 limited liability company
 firm or association.
      
. The Plan
 the granting and vesting of Awards under
          the Plan and the issuance and delivery of Shares and the payment of money under the Plan or under Awards granted or awarded hereunder are subject to compliance with all Applicable Law (including but not limited to state
 federal and foreign
          securities law and margin requirements)
 and to such approvals by any listing
 regulatory or governmental authority as may
 in the opinion of counsel for the Company
 be necessary or advisable in connection therewith. Any securities delivered
          under the Plan shall be subject to such restrictions
 and the person acquiring such securities shall
 if requested by the Company
 provide such assurances and representations to the Company as the Company may deem necessary or desirable to assure
          compliance with all Applicable Law. The Administrator
 in its sole discretion
 may take whatever actions it deems necessary or appropriate to effect compliance with Applicable Law
 including
 without limitation
 placing legends on share
          certificates and issuing stop-transfer notices to agents and registrars.&#160; Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein
 the Administrator may not take any actions hereunder
 and no Awards shall be granted
 that would violate Applicable Law. To
          the extent permitted by Applicable Law
 the Plan and Awards granted or awarded hereunder shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to Applicable Law.
      


          

Titles and Headings
 References to Sections of the Code or Exchange Act
          The titles and headings of the Sections in the Plan are for convenience of reference only and
 in the event of any conflict
 the text of the Plan
 rather than such titles or headings
 shall control. References to sections of the Code or the
          Exchange Act shall include any amendment or successor thereto.
      
. The Plan and any Programs and Award Agreements hereunder
          shall be administered
 interpreted and enforced under the internal laws of the State of Delaware without regard to conflicts of laws thereof or of any other jurisdiction.
      
. To the extent that the Administrator
          determines that any Award granted under the Plan is subject to Section 409A
 the Plan
 the Program pursuant to which such Award is granted and the Award Agreement evidencing such Award shall incorporate the terms and conditions required by
          Section 409A. In that regard
 to the extent any Award under the Plan or any other compensatory plan or arrangement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to Section 409A
 and such Award or other amount is payable on account of a
          Holder&#8217;s Termination of Service (or any similarly defined term)
 then (a) such Award or amount shall only be paid to the extent such Termination of Service qualifies as a &#8220;separation from service&#8221; as defined in Section 409A
 and (b) if such Award
          or amount is payable to a &#8220;specified employee&#8221; as defined in Section 409A then
 to the extent required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section 409A
 such Award or other compensatory payment shall not be payable prior to the
          earlier of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of the Holder&#8217;s Termination of Service
 or (ii) the date of the Holder&#8217;s death.&#160;&#160; To the extent applicable
 the Plan
 the Program and any Award Agreements shall be
          interpreted in accordance with Section 409A. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary
 in the event that
 following the Effective Date the Administrator determines that any Award may be subject to Section 409A
 the Administrator
          may (but is not obligated to)
 without a Holder&#8217;s consent
 adopt such amendments to the Plan and the applicable Program and Award Agreement or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments
 policies and procedures with retroactive
          effect)
 or take any other actions
 that the Administrator determines are necessary or appropriate to (A) exempt the Award from Section 409A and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided with respect to the Award
 or (B)

        otherwise.&#160; The Company shall have no obligation under this Section 12.10 or otherwise to take any action (whether or not described herein) to avoid the imposition of taxes
 penalties or interest under Section 409A with respect to any Award and
        shall have no liability to any Holder or any other person if any Award
 compensation or other benefits under the Plan are determined to constitute non-compliant
 &#8220;nonqualified deferred compensation&#8221; subject to the imposition of taxes
 penalties

      
. The Plan is intended to be an &#8220;unfunded&#8221; plan for incentive compensation.
          With respect to any payments not yet made to a Holder pursuant to an Award
 nothing contained in the Plan or any Program or Award Agreement shall give the Holder any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company or any
          Subsidiary.
      



          

. To the extent permitted under Applicable Law and the Organizational Documents
 each
          member of the Administrator (and each delegate thereof pursuant to Section 11.6) shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company from any loss
 cost
 liability
 or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such member in
          connection with or resulting from any claim
 action
 suit
 or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action or failure to act pursuant to the Plan or any Award Agreement and against and
          from any and all amounts paid by him or her
 with the Board&#8217;s approval
 in satisfaction of judgment in such action
 suit
 he or she gives the Company an opportunity
 at its own expense
 to handle
          and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf and
 once the Company gives notice of its intent to assume such defense
 the Company shall have sole control over such defense with counsel of the
          Company&#8217;s choosing. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be available to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment or other final adjudication
 in either case not subject to further appeal
 determines that
          the acts or omissions of the person seeking indemnity giving rise to the indemnification claim resulted from such person&#8217;s bad faith
 fraud or willful criminal act or omission. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any
          other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled pursuant to the Organizational Documents
 as a matter of law
 or otherwise
 or any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.
      
. No payment pursuant to the Plan shall be taken into account in
          determining any benefits under any pension
 retirement
 savings
 profit sharing
 group insurance
 welfare or other benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in writing in such other plan or an
          agreement thereunder.
      
      
      
. To the maximum extent permitted under Section 162(m) of the
          Code and Applicable Law
 Awards under this Plan shall not be subject to the deduction limit set forth in U.S. Treasury Regulation 1.162-27(b) pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
 to the
          extent such Awards may qualify for any post-public offering reliance period deduction limit exception set forth in U.S. Treasury Regulation 1.162-27(f) (or any successor thereto)
 and the Plan and Award Agreements shall be interpreted
          accordingly.

On June 21
 2018
 the U.S. Supreme Court rendered a 5-4 majority decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc.
 17-494. Among other things
 the Court held that a state may require an out-of-state seller with no physical presence in the state to collect and remit sales taxes on goods the seller ships to consumers in the state
 overturning existing court precedent. The Company discovered that TruPet had not collected and paid sales tax related to all sales in some states where it had a physical presence.&amp;#160; The Company recognized $1.2 million and no sales tax liability as of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.&amp;#160; While additional assessments are not anticipated
 additional states may assert that the Company has nexus and must pay sales tax for prior sales.&amp;#160; The Company does not believe that additional assessments
 if any
 will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;In connection with the preparation of the Company&amp;#8217;s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company identified an error as of December 31
 2018 related to an understatement of sales taxes due and payable of $0.7 million. The error was corrected during the year ended December 31
 2019. The Company believes that the correction of this error is not material to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31

 2019
 Better Choice Company Inc. completed the acquisition of TruPet LLC (&amp;#8220;TruPet&amp;#8221;) and Bona Vida Inc. (&amp;#8220;Bona Vida&amp;#8221;) in a pair of all stock transactions (together referred to as the &amp;#8220;May Acquisitions&amp;#8221;) through the issuance of 33
130
806 shares of common stock
 par value $0.001
 of the Company. Following the completion of the May Acquisitions
 the business conducted by the Company became primarily the businesses conducted by TruPet and Bona Vida.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company is the legal acquirer of TruPet and Bona Vida. However
 the May Acquisitions were treated as a reverse acquisition whereby TruPet acquired the Company and Bona Vida for accounting and financial reporting purposes. As a result
 the financial statements for the year ending December 31
 2019 are comprised of (1) the results of TruPet for the period between January 1
 2019 and December 31
 2019
 (2) the results of the Company and Bona Vida
 after giving effect to the May Acquisitions on May 6
 2019 through December 31
 2019 and (3) the results of the Company and Halo
 after giving effect to the Halo Acquisition (see &amp;#8220;Note 2 &amp;#8211; Acquisitions&amp;#8221;) on December 19
 2019 through December 31
 2019. The financial statements for the year ended December 31
 2018 and all periods presented prior to the effective date of the May Acquisitions on May 6
 2019 are comprised solely of the operations and financial position of TruPet
 and therefore
 are not directly comparable. TruPet&amp;#8217;s equity has been re-cast to reflect the equity structure of Better Choice Company and the shares of common stock received in the May Acquisitions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;On December 19
 2019
 the Company acquired 100% of all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Halo
 a Delaware corporation (the &amp;#8220;Halo Acquisition&amp;#8221;). Where the context allows
 the May Acquisitions and Halo Acquisition are together referred to as the &amp;#8220;Acquisitions.&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;References to the &amp;#8220;Company&amp;#8221;

The financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis subsequent to the Acquisitions and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management
 all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and operating results have been included.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future.

 2019
 the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the &amp;#8220;Halo Agreement&amp;#8221;) to acquire Halo
 a Delaware corporation. Halo is an ultra-premium
 natural pet food brand. The strategic objective of the acquisition was to accelerate the growth of the Company&amp;#8217;s animal health platform by acquiring an all-encompassing
 global
 animal health and wellness consumer product goods company. Under the terms of the Halo Agreement
 the Company completed the Halo Acquisition on December 19
 2019 (the &amp;#8220;Halo Acquisition Date&amp;#8221;)
 for $38.2 million. The consideration was subject to customary adjustments for Halo&amp;#8217;s net working capital
 cash
 and indebtedness
 and consisted of a combination of (i) cash consideration of $20.5 million
 (ii) 2
134
390 shares of the Company&amp;#8217;s common stock
 par value $0.001 per share ($3.9 million)
 (iii) Seller Notes totaling $15
000
000
 and (iv) 937
500 Seller Warrants ($0.3 million). The Company incurred $0.9 million in transaction costs
 which are included in general and administrative expenses.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Halo Acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting
 and accordingly
 the purchase price was allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the Halo Acquisition Date.&amp;#160; Halo&amp;#8217;s revenue of $0.7 million and net and comprehensive loss of $0.2 million have been included in the consolidated results of the Company since the Halo Acquisition Date.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The determination of the preliminary purchase price allocation to specific assets acquired and liabilities assumed is incomplete for Halo.&amp;#160; The preliminary purchase price allocation may change in future periods as the fair value estimates of assets and liabilities and the valuation of the related tax assets and liabilities are completed.

The intangible asset related to customer relationships reflects the estimated net present value of the future cash flows associated with the stable and recurring customer base acquired in the Halo Acquisition. The fair value was determined using an income approach
 which recognizes that the fair value of an asset is premised upon the expected receipt of future economic benefits such as earnings and cash inflows based on current sales projections and estimated direct costs for each product line. Acquired customer relationships are finite-lived intangible assets and are amortized over their estimated life of 7 years using the straight-line method
 which approximates the customer attrition rate
 reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;All of Halo&amp;#8217;s products and services are sold under the &amp;#8220;Halo&amp;#8221; trade name
 and each major product is identified by this trade name. The trade name of the Company was valued on an income approach using a 2% royalty rate which is supported by both market royalty rate data and profitability factors of Halo. The trade name is a finite-lived intangible asset and is being amortized over its estimated life of 15 years using the straight-line method
 which reflects the pattern of economic benefits associated with this asset.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The excess of purchase price over the fair value amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed represents goodwill from the acquisition. The Company believes the factors that contributed to goodwill include the acquisition of a talented workforce and administrative cost synergies. The Company does not expect any portion of this goodwill to be deductible for tax purposes. See &amp;#8220;Note 9 &amp;#8211; Intangible assets
 royalties and goodwill.&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-weight: bold;&gt;Pro Forma Information (Unaudited)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The following pro forma results reflect only pro forma adjustments for additional interest expense to fund the Halo Acquisition
 amortization of deferred financing costs related to short term loan and line of credit
 reduction in interest expense associated with the repayment of the Halo debt on the Halo Acquisition Date
 amortization of identifiable intangible assets associated with the Halo Acquisition
 share-based compensation expense related to stock options granted and effects of adjustments made to carrying values of acquired assets and liabilities. However
 pro forma results do not include any anticipated synergies from the acquisition of Halo and accordingly
 are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred if the Halo Acquisition had occurred on the dates indicated or that may result in the future.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 style=width: 70%; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt; text-align: left;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=bottom style=vertical-align: middle; padding-bottom: 2px; width: 46%;&gt;&lt;div style=text-indent: -7.2pt; margin-left: 7.2pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic;&gt;Dollars in thousands&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=1 valign=bottom style=vertical-align: bottom; padding-bottom: 2px; width: 1%;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=6 nowrap=nowrap valign=bottom style=vertical-align: middle; border-bottom: 2px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: center; color: #000000; font-weight: bold;&gt;Twelve Months ended December 31

 due to related parties and revolving line of credit&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;In May 2017
 TruPet along with the majority owners serving as co-borrowers entered into a line of credit providing for up to $2.0 million of borrowings secured by the personal assets of the two majority owners. Through various amendments
 the maximum borrowings under the credit facility increased to $4.6 million as of December 31
 2018
 with a maturity of May 2019. Borrowings bore interest at LIBOR plus 3% and were repaid on May 6
 2019. At December 31
 2018
 outstanding borrowings were $4.6 million.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The line of credit was secured by personal assets of the co-borrowers
 as noted above. Covenants under the line of credit required TruPet to be within certain restrictions. As of December 31
 2018
 TruPet was in compliance with its covenants.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;At December 31
 2018
 due to related party consisted of a $1.6 million unsecured note payable to a director of TruPet bearing 26.6% interest with principal and interest due within 30 days after change of control
 as described below.&amp;#160; On May 6
 2019
 this loan was repaid. There was no accrued interest recorded at either December 31
 2018 or December 31
 2019.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;On May 6
 2019
 Better Choice Company refinanced the $4.6 million credit facility and the $1.6 million note payable to a director with a $6.2 million revolving line of credit with a financial institution. The $6.2 million revolving line of credit was secured by restricted cash held in a money market account. In connection with the consummation of the Halo Acquisition
 the Company terminated the $6.2 million revolving line of credit. Early termination of the revolving line of credit did not trigger any premiums or penalties
 other than customary breakage costs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;&gt;Short term loan and line of credit&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;On the Halo Acquisition Date
 the Company entered into a Loan Facilities Agreement (the &amp;#8220;Facilities Agreement&amp;#8221;) by and among the Company
 as the borrower
 the several lenders from time to time parties thereto (collectively
 the &amp;#8220;Lenders&amp;#8221;) and a private debt lender
 as agent (the &amp;#8220;Agent&amp;#8221;). The Facilities Agreement provides for (i) a term loan facility of $20.5 million and (ii) a revolving demand loan facility not to exceed $7.5 million.&amp;#160; The Company borrowed $20.5 million on the short term loan and $5.0 million on the line of credit on December 19
 2019. The principal remains outstanding as of December 31
 2019.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The short-term loan and line of credit were issued with customary affirmative and negative covenants relating to the incurrence of debt
 liens
 declaring or paying dividends
 purchasing our redeeming our common stock
 the making of restricted payments and asset sales and certain other fundamental changes and events of default such as maintaining timely payments
 filing tax and regulatory documents in a timely manner
 continuing the existing business with control over existing assets
 default on senior debt
 and voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. The Facilities Agreement is secured by substantially all assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors (who include Halo
 TruPet and Bona Vida). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;As of December 31
 2019
 the term loan outstanding was $20.5 million
 net of debt issuance costs and discounts of $4.4 million
 and the line of credit outstanding was $5.0 million
 net of debt issuance costs of $0.2 million.&amp;#160; The debt issuance costs and discounts are amortized using the effective interest method.&amp;#160; The term loan and line of credit are scheduled to mature on December 19
 2020 or such earlier date on which a demand is made by the Agent or any Lender.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company used the proceeds of the short term loan to complete the Halo Acquisition and to pay transaction fees and expenses.&amp;#160; The Company intends to use the proceeds of the line of credit for working capital and general corporate purposes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;To induce the Agent to enter into the agreement
 certain directors and shareholders of the Company (&amp;#8220;Shareholder Guarantors&amp;#8221;) agreed to enter into a Continuing Guaranty (the &amp;#8220;Shareholder Guaranties&amp;#8221;) in the amount of $20.0 million and guarantee the Company&amp;#8217;s obligations under the agreement.&amp;#160; As consideration for the Shareholder Guaranties
 the Company agreed to issue common stock purchase warrants to the Shareholder Guarantors in an amount equal to 0.325 warrants for each dollar of debt under the agreement guaranteed by such Shareholder Guarantors (the &amp;#8220;Guarantor Warrants&amp;#8221;). The Guarantor Warrants are exercisable any time from the date of issuance for up to 24 months from the date of the consummation of an IPO (as defined therein) at an exercise price $1.82 per share. The Guarantor Warrants have a fair value of $4.2 million on the date of issuance.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;As of December 31

 2018
 the Company closed a private placement offering (the &amp;#8220;December Offering&amp;#8221;) of 1
425
641 units (the &amp;#8220;Units&amp;#8221;)
 each unit consisting of (i) one share of the Company&amp;#8217;s common stock and (ii) a warrant to purchase one half of a share of common stock. The Units were offered at a fixed price of $1.95 per Unit for gross proceeds of $2.8 million. Costs associated with the December Offering were $0.1 million
 and net proceeds were $2.7 million. The December Offering generated $2.6 million of net proceeds that were received by the Company during the year ended December 31
 2018 for the sale of 1
400
000 Units
 and $0.1 million of the net proceeds were received on January 8
 2019 for the sale of 25
641 Units. The warrants are exercisable anytime from the date of issuance over a two-year period at the initial exercise price of $3.90 per share.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The warrants include an option to settle in cash in the event of a change of control of the Company and a reset feature if the Company issues shares of common stock with a strike price below $3.90 per share
 which requires the Company to record the warrants as a derivative liability. The Company calculates the fair value of the derivative liability through a Monte Carlo Model that values the warrants based upon a probability weighted discounted cash flow model.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;During January 2020
 the Company issued shares below the exercise price of warrants acquired on May 6
 2019.&amp;#160; Pursuant to the warrant agreement
 the Company issued an additional 1
003
232 warrants on March 17
 2020 to its warrant holders at a $1.62 exercise price and revise the existing warrants to an exercise price of $1.62.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The warrants are valued based on future assumptions and
 as the reset trigger was a known event on December 31
 2019
 the Company included the trigger in the valuation performed during the period ended December 31
 2019.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;At May 6

 and a warrant derivative liability. The warrant derivative liability is remeasured at fair value each reporting period.&amp;#160; The carrying values for other financial instruments are deemed to be equivalent to their respective fair values due to their relative short term nature.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company has applied the framework for measuring fair value which requires a fair value hierarchy to be applied to all fair value measurements.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company uses applicable guidance for defining fair value
 the initial recording and periodic remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value
 and related disclosures for instruments measured at fair value. Fair value accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy
 which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. An instrument&amp;#8217;s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instrument&amp;#8217;s fair value measurement. The Company measures assets and liabilities using inputs from the following three levels of fair value hierarchy:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Level 1 - Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability
 either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability for which there is little
 if any
 market activity at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company&amp;#8217;s own assumptions about what market participants would use to price the asset or liability. The inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances
 which may include the Company&amp;#8217;s own financial data
 such as internally developed pricing models
 discounted cash flow methodologies
 as well as instruments for which the fair value determination requires significant management judgment.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The warrant derivative liability is remeasured at fair value each reporting period and represents a Level 3 financial instrument.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities reflect Level 3 inputs and are primarily used to measure the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations
 for goodwill

 2019 consist of customer relationships and trade name acquired in the Halo Acquisition. The customer relationships and trade name are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 7 and 15 years respectively
 using the straight-line method.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;In April 2019
 Better Choice Company entered into a licensing agreement with Authentic Brands and Elvis Presley Enterprises (&amp;#8220;ABG&amp;#8221;) whereby Better Choice was to sell newly developed hemp-derived CBD products that will be marketed under the Elvis Presley Houndog name.&amp;#160; The license agreement required an upfront equity payment of $1.0 million worth of common stock. Upon the May Acquisitions on May 6
 2019
 the Company acquired the license agreement and recorded it at its amortized cost which approximated fair value.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;As of December 31
 2019
 the Company paid $0.6 million of the 2019-2020 agreed royalty payments. As there were no sales related to Houndog products during the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company determined that the minimum royalties paid during the year through December 31
 2019 should be expensed. The Houndog license agreement was terminated on January 13
 2020
 see &amp;#8220;Note 22 - Subsequent events.&amp;#8221; The Company recognized amortization expense of $0.1 million and an impairment of the license intangible of $0.9 million as of and for the period ended December 31
 2019
 respectively.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company&amp;#8217;s intangible assets as of December 31

 2019 in connection with the Halo Acquisition. In future years
 the Company will complete an annual impairment test for goodwill that includes an assessment of qualitative factors including
 but not limited to
 macroeconomic conditions
 industry and market conditions
 and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance.&amp;#160; The Company will perform annual impairment tests as of October 31st beginning in 2020 or earlier if indicators of impairment exist.&amp;#160; There were no indicators of goodwill impairment as of December 31


  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  


 2019 and 2018
 the Company recorded no current or deferred income tax expense.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;For the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Company was a Limited Liability Company
 taxed as a partnership.&amp;#160; Thus
 all of the Company&amp;#8217;s income and losses flowed through to the owners.&amp;#160; Furthermore
 no deferred tax assets and liabilities were recorded.&amp;#160; Beginning in 2019 the Company converted to a C-Corporation and is subject to tax at an entity level.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company&amp;#8217;s effective tax rate differs from the United States federal statutory rate of 21% primarily because the Company&amp;#8217;s losses have been fully offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertainty as to the realization of the tax benefit of net operating losses (&amp;#8220;NOLs&amp;#8221;) for the year ended December 31
 2019. The following table is a reconciliation of the components that caused our provision for income taxes to differ from amounts computed by applying the United States federal statutory rate of 21% for the year ended December 31

 2019
 the Company had a deferred tax asset (before valuation allowance) recorded on gross federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $36.3 million and $32.7 million
 respectively. These net operating losses will begin to expire in 2027.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Internal Revenue Code
 as amended (&amp;#8220;IRC&amp;#8221;)
 imposes restrictions on the utilization of NOLs and other tax attributes in the event of an &amp;#8220;ownership change&amp;#8221; of a corporation. Accordingly
 a company&amp;#8217;s ability to use pre-change NOLs may be limited as prescribed under IRC Section 382. Events which may cause limitation in the amount of the NOLs and credits that can be utilized annually include
 but are not limited to
 a cumulative ownership change of more than 50% over a three-year period.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Under ASC 805
 &amp;#8220;Business Combinations&amp;#8221;
 an acquirer should recognize
 and measure deferred taxes arising from assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination in accordance with ASC 740. The financial statement loss includes losses that will not result in future deferred tax assets and therefore these losses are excluded.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets in the future. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred through the year ended December 31
 2019 and 2018. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective positive evidence such as current year taxable income and future income projections. On the basis of this evaluation
 as of the year ended December 31
 2019
 a valuation allowance of $7.9 million was recorded since it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 style=font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt; text-align: left; color: #000000; width: 100%;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=bottom style=vertical-align: bottom; padding-bottom: 2px;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=1 valign=bottom style=vertical-align: bottom; padding-bottom: 2px;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=2 nowrap=nowrap valign=bottom style=vertical-align: bottom; border-bottom: #000000 solid 2px;&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: center; font-weight: bold;&gt;Year Ended December 31

 Tax Exempt Income

  


  



 &amp;#8220;Income Taxes (ASC 740)&amp;#8221;
 which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for loss and credit carryforwards using enacted tax rates anticipated to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided
 if
 based upon the weight of available evidence
 it is more likely than not that some or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist
 the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that some or all the benefit will more likely than not be realized. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position
 as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. As of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company does not have any significant uncertain income tax positions. If incurred
 the Company would classify interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as income tax expense.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company was incorporated on May 6
 2019. Prior to this date
 the Company operated as a flow through entity for state and United States federal tax purposes. The Company files a U.S. federal and state income tax return

 less accumulated amortization. The Company reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and any not expected to be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows are written down to current fair value. The Company acquired an intangible asset related to the Houndog license with the acquisition of Bona Vida an May 6
 2019. The Company fully impaired the asset as of December 31
 2019 as we terminated the contract on January 13
 2020. The Company acquired intangible assets with the acquisition of Halo on December 19
 2019. We will review impairment of the assets acquired beginning in the fiscal year ending on December 31

 2019
 the Company adopted the FASB guidance on leases (&amp;#8220;Topic 842&amp;#8221;)
 which requires leases with durations greater than twelve months to be recognized on the balance sheet. The Company adopted Topic 842 using the modified retrospective transition approach.&amp;#160; Prior year financial statements were not recast under Topic 842
 and therefore those amounts are not disclosed. The Company has elected certain practical expedients
 including the package of practical expedients to not reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases
 lease classification and initial direct costs as well as an accounting policy to account for lease and non-lease components as a single component.&amp;#160; The Company also elected the optional transition method that gives companies the option to use the effective date as the date of initial application on transition
 and as a result
 the Company did not adjust its comparative period financial information or make the new required lease disclosures for periods before the effective date. The Company has elected to make the accounting policy election for short-term leases. Consequently
 short-term leases are recorded as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.&amp;#160; The Company did not elect the hindsight practical expedient.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company&amp;#8217;s leases relate to our corporate offices and warehouse. For leases with terms greater than 12 months
 the Company records the related asset and obligation at the present value of lease payments over the term. Lease renewal options are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use assets and right-of-use liabilities unless the Company is reasonably certain to exercise the optional renewal periods. The Company&amp;#8217;s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.&amp;#160; Additionally
 the Company&amp;#8217;s leases contain rent escalations over the lease term and the Company recognizes expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Some of the Company&amp;#8217;s leases include rent escalations based on inflation indexes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company identified an error as of January 1
 2019 related to the adoption of ASC 842
 Leases
 which resulted in an overstatement of less than $0.1 million for right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities
 respectively.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; The Company also identified an overstatement of Accumulated Deficit of less than $0.1 million as of January 1
 2019.&amp;#160; The errors related to the impact upon adoption of ASC 842 were corrected during the twelve months ended December 31
 2019.&amp;#160; The Company believes the correction of these errors is not material to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the twelve months ended December 31
 2019.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;For leases entered into or reassessed after the adoption of the new standard
 the Company has elected the practical expedient allowed by the standard to account for all fixed consideration in a lease as a single lease component. Therefore
 the lease payments used to measure the operating lease liability for these leases include fixed minimum rentals along with fixed operating costs such as common area maintenance and utilities.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company&amp;#8217;s leases do not provide a readily available implicit rate. Therefore
 the Company estimates the incremental borrowing discount rate based on information available at lease commencement. The discount rates used are indicative of a synthetic credit rating based on quantitative and qualitative analysis.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The table below presents the lease-related assets and liabilities recorded upon adoption:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 style=font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt; text-align: left; color: #000000; width: 100%;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=bottom style=vertical-align: bottom;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=bottom style=vertical-align: bottom;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=1 valign=bottom style=vertical-align: bottom;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=2 nowrap=nowrap valign=bottom style=vertical-align: bottom;&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: center; color: #000000; font-weight: bold;&gt;January 1

 accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof issued by the FASB that have effective dates during the reporting period and in future periods.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Recently adopted:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-style: italic;&gt;Adoption of FASB ASC Topic 842 &amp;#8220;Leases&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;In February 2016
 the Financial Accounting Standard Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&amp;#8220;ASU&amp;#8221;) 2016-02
 Topic 842
 &amp;#8220;Leases (842)&amp;#8221;
 which amends leasing guidance by requiring companies to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all operating and financing leases with lease terms greater than twelve months. The lease liability is equal to the present value of lease payments. The right-of-use lease asset is based on the lease liability
 subject to adjustment for prepaid and deferred rent and tenant incentives. For income statement purposes
 leases will continue to be classified as operating or financing with lease expense in both cases calculated substantially the same as under the prior leasing guidance.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in recognition of right-of-use assets of $0.4 million and operating lease liabilities of $0.4 million as of January 1
 2019. The Company adopted the optional transition method that gives companies the option to use the adoption date as the initial application on transition.&amp;#160; Accordingly
 results for reporting periods beginning prior to January 1
 2019 continue to be reported in accordance with our historical treatment.&amp;#160; The adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations or cash flows. See &amp;#8220;Note 8 &amp;#8211; Operating leases.&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-style: italic;&gt;Adoption of FASB ASU 2018-07 &amp;#8220;Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;On January 1
 2019
 the Company adopted ASU. 2018-07 &amp;#8220;Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting.&amp;#8221; The amendments in this update expanded the scope of ASC 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. The requirements of ASC 718 are applied to nonemployee awards except for specific guidance on inputs to an option pricing model and the attribution of cost. The amendments specify that ASC 718 applies to all share-based payment transactions in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in a grantor&amp;#8217;s own operations by issuing share-based payment awards. The amendments also clarify that ASC 718 does not apply to share-based payments used to effectively provide (1) financing to the issuer or (2) awards granted in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract accounted for under ASC 606
 &amp;#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers.&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company is treating the inclusion of share-based payments to nonemployees as a change in accounting principle prospectively beginning in the period ending January 1
 2019.&amp;#160; The Company did not restate prior periods for share-based compensation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Issued but not Yet Adopted:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-style: italic;&gt;ASU 2016-13 &amp;#8220;Financial Instruments &amp;#8211; Credit Losses (Topic 326)&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;In June 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 &amp;#8220;Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)
&amp;#8221; a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The standard is effective for the Company on January 1
 2023
 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-style: italic;&gt;ASU 2018-13 &amp;#8220;Fair Value Measurement&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-13
 &amp;#8220;Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) Changes to the Disclosure Requirement for Fair Value Measurement&amp;#8221; which amends ASC 820 to expand the disclosures required for items subject to Level 3
 fair value remeasurement
 including the underlying assumptions.&amp;#160; ASU 2018-13 is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019.&amp;#160; The Company is currently evaluating the impact the new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. As this standard only requires additional disclosures
 there is no anticipated financial statement impact of its adoption.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-style: italic;&gt;ASU 2018-15 &amp;#8220;Intangibles &amp;#8211; Goodwill and Other &amp;#8211; Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40)&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-style: italic;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-15 &amp;#8220;Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40)&amp;#8221; to amend ASU 2015-05 in an effort to provide additional guidance on the accounting for costs implementation activities performed in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract.&amp;#160; The amendments in this update align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license).&amp;#160; The accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract is not affected by the amendments in this update.&amp;#160; The amendments in this update also require the entity to present the expense related to the capitalized implementation costs in the same line item in the statement of income as the fees associated with the hosting element (service) of the arrangement and classify payments for capitalizing implementation costs in the statement of cash flows in the same manner as payments made for fees associated with the hosting element.&amp;#160; The entity is also required to present the capitalized implementation costs in the statement of financial position in the same line item that a prepayment for the fees of the associated hosting arrangement would be presented. The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1
 2020
 and early adoption is permitted.&amp;#160; The Company believes that current practices of capitalization versus expensing IT costs are in line with this guidance

 and leverage our established digital footprint to provide pet parents with the knowledge to make informed decision about their pet&amp;#8217;s health. &lt;/font&gt;We sell the majority of our dog food

 2019
 Better Choice Company Inc. completed the acquisition of TruPet LLC (&amp;#8220;TruPet&amp;#8221;) and Bona Vida Inc. (&amp;#8220;Bona Vida&amp;#8221;) in a pair of all stock transactions (together referred to as the &amp;#8220;May Acquisitions&amp;#8221;) through the issuance of 33
130
806 shares of common stock
 par value $0.001
 of the Company. Following the completion of the May Acquisitions
 the business conducted by the Company became primarily the businesses conducted by TruPet and Bona Vida.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company is the legal acquirer of TruPet and Bona Vida. However
 the May Acquisitions were treated as a reverse acquisition whereby TruPet acquired the Company and Bona Vida for accounting and financial reporting purposes. As a result
 the financial statements for the year ending December 31
 2019 are comprised of (1) the results of TruPet for the period between January 1
 2019 and December 31
 2019
 (2) the results of the Company and Bona Vida
 after giving effect to the May Acquisitions on May 6
 2019 through December 31
 2019 and (3) the results of the Company and Halo
 after giving effect to the Halo Acquisition (see &amp;#8220;Note 2 &amp;#8211; Acquisitions&amp;#8221;) on December 19
 2019 through December 31
 2019. The financial statements for the year ended December 31
 2018 and all periods presented prior to the effective date of the May Acquisitions on May 6
 2019 are comprised solely of the operations and financial position of TruPet
 and therefore
 are not directly comparable. TruPet&amp;#8217;s equity has been re-cast to reflect the equity structure of Better Choice Company and the shares of common stock received in the May Acquisitions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;On December 19
 2019
 the Company acquired 100% of all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Halo
 a Delaware corporation (the &amp;#8220;Halo Acquisition&amp;#8221;). Where the context allows
 the May Acquisitions and Halo Acquisition are together referred to as the &amp;#8220;Acquisitions.&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;References to the &amp;#8220;Company&amp;#8221;
 &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8221;

 2019.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company&amp;#8217;s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for annual financial reports and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis subsequent to the Acquisitions and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management
 all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and operating results have been included.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future. The significant accounting policies applied by the Company are described below. We present our tables in U.S. dollars (thousands) and percentage as rounded up or down. In the notes
 we represent US dollars (millions) and percentage as rounded up or down.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;&gt;Going concern considerations&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company is subject to risks common in the pet wellness consumer market including
 but not limited to
 dependence on key personnel
 competitive forces
 successful marketing and sale of its products
 the successful protection of its proprietary technologies
 ability to grow into new markets
 and compliance with government regulations. In December 2019
 a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan
 China. Uncertainties regarding the economic impact of COVID-19
 the disease caused by the novel coronavirus
 are likely to result in sustained market turmoil
 which could also negatively impact our business
 financial condition
 and cash flows. The Company has incurred losses over the last three years and has an accumulated deficit. The Company continues to rely on current investors and the public markets to finance these losses through debt and/or equity issuance. These operating losses and the outstanding debt create substantial doubt about the Company&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the date these consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company is implementing plans to achieve cost savings and other strategic objectives to address these conditions. The Company expects cost savings from consolidation of third-party manufacturers
 optimizing shipping and warehousing as well as overhead cost reductions. The business is focused on growing the most profitable channels while reducing investments in areas that are expected to have long-term benefits. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates the realization of assets and payments of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly
 the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount of and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;&gt;Cash and cash equivalents&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits held with banks and highly liquid investments with original maturities of ninety days or less at acquisition date. For purposes of reporting cash flows
 the Company considers all cash accounts that are not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties to be cash and cash equivalents.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;&gt;Restricted cash&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;At December 31
 2019
 the Company had $0.2 million in restricted cash. The Company is required to maintain a restricted cash balance of less than $0.2 million associated with a business credit card and credit card clearance operations. The Company did not have any restricted cash at December 31
 2018.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;&gt;Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Accounts receivable primarily consist of unpaid buyer invoices from the Company&amp;#8217;s Retail customers and credit card payments receivable from third-party credit card processing companies. Accounts receivable is stated at the amount billed to customers
 net of point of sale and cash discounts. The Company assesses the collectability of all receivables on an ongoing basis by considering its historical credit loss experience
 current economic conditions
 and other relevant factors. Based on this analysis
 an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded. The provision for doubtful accounts is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company recorded less than $0.1 million allowance for doubtful accounts for the year ended December 31
 2019. For the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Company considered accounts receivable to be fully collectible and
 accordingly
 no allowance for doubtful accounts was recorded.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;&gt;Inventories&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Inventories
 primarily consisting of products available for sale and supplies
 are valued using the first-in first-out (&amp;#8220;FIFO&amp;#8221;) method and are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on a standard cost basis and includes the purchase price
 as well as inbound freight costs and packaging costs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand. Excess or obsolete reserves are established when inventory is estimated to not be sellable before expiration dates based on forecasted usage
 product demand and product life cycle.&amp;#160; Additionally
 inventory valuation reflects adjustments for anticipated physical inventory losses

 less accumulated amortization. The Company reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and any not expected to be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows are written down to current fair value. The Company acquired an intangible asset related to the Houndog license with the acquisition of Bona Vida an May 6
 2019. The Company fully impaired the asset as of December 31
 2019 as we terminated the contract on January 13
 2020. The Company acquired intangible assets with the acquisition of Halo on December 19
 2019. We will review impairment of the assets acquired beginning in the fiscal year ending on December 31
 2020 given the proximity of the Halo Acquisition to year-end.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;&gt;Redeemable convertible preferred stock&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 480

The Company&amp;#8217;s Redeemable Series E Convertible Preferred Stock (the &amp;#8220;Series E&amp;#8221;) contains redemption provisions that require it to be presented outside of stockholders&amp;#8217; deficit. Changes in the redemption value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock

 &amp;#8220;Income Taxes (ASC 740)&amp;#8221;
 which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for loss and credit carryforwards using enacted tax rates anticipated to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided
 if
 based upon the weight of available evidence
 it is more likely than not that some or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist
 the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that some or all the benefit will more likely than not be realized. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position
 as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. As of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company does not have any significant uncertain income tax positions. If incurred
 the Company would classify interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as income tax expense.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company was incorporated on May 6
 2019. Prior to this date
 the Company operated as a flow through entity for state and United States federal tax purposes. The Company files a U.S. federal and state income tax return

Our advertising expenses consisting primarily of online advertising
 search costs
 email advertising

 with the acquisition of Halo
 we reimburse our customers and third parties for in store activities and record these costs as sales and marketing expenses. Advertising costs were $6.7 million and $3.9 million for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;&gt;Customer service and warehousing&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Customer service and warehousing include wages associated with customer service and fulfillment of DTC customer orders.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;&gt;Fair value of financial instruments&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company&amp;#8217;s financial instruments recognized on the balance sheets consist of cash and cash equivalents
 restricted cash
 accounts receivable
 prepaid deposits
 accounts payable
 short term loan
 line of credit
 subordinated convertible notes
 accrued liabilities
 other liabilities
 and a warrant derivative liability. The warrant derivative liability is remeasured at fair value each reporting period.&amp;#160; The carrying values for other financial instruments are deemed to be equivalent to their respective fair values due to their relative short term nature.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company has applied the framework for measuring fair value which requires a fair value hierarchy to be applied to all fair value measurements.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company uses applicable guidance for defining fair value
 the initial recording and periodic remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value
 and related disclosures for instruments measured at fair value. Fair value accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy
 which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. An instrument&amp;#8217;s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instrument&amp;#8217;s fair value measurement. The Company measures assets and liabilities using inputs from the following three levels of fair value hierarchy:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Level 1 - Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability
 either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability for which there is little
 if any
 market activity at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company&amp;#8217;s own assumptions about what market participants would use to price the asset or liability. The inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances
 which may include the Company&amp;#8217;s own financial data
 such as internally developed pricing models
 discounted cash flow methodologies
 as well as instruments for which the fair value determination requires significant management judgment.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The warrant derivative liability is remeasured at fair value each reporting period and represents a Level 3 financial instrument.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities reflect Level 3 inputs and are primarily used to measure the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations
 for goodwill
 other intangible assets and long-lived assets impairment analyses and the valuation of acquired intangibles.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;&gt;Basic and diluted loss per share&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Basic and diluted loss per share has been determined by dividing the net and comprehensive loss available to common stockholders for the applicable period by the basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding
 respectively. Common stock equivalents and incentive shares are excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share when their effect is anti-dilutive.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;&gt;Share-based compensation&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company recognizes compensation expense for all share&amp;#8211;based payments in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718
 Compensation &amp;#8211; Stock Compensation. The Company follows the fair value method of accounting for awards granted to employees
 directors
 officers and consultants. Share-based awards are measured at their estimated fair value on each respective grant date. The Company recognizes share-based payment expenses over the vesting period. The Company&amp;#8217;s share-based compensation awards are subject only to service based vesting conditions. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The fair value of an option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black&amp;#8211;Scholes option valuation model. The Black&amp;#8211;Scholes option valuation model requires the development of assumptions that are inputs into the model. These assumptions are the expected stock volatility
 the risk&amp;#8211;free interest rate
 the expected life of the option and the expected dividend yield which is based on the historical dividends issued by the Company. The Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Expected volatility is calculated based on the analysis of other public companies within the pet wellness
 internet commerce (e-commerce)
 and hemp derived CBD sectors. Risk&amp;#8211;free interest rates are calculated based on risk&amp;#8211;free rates for the appropriate term. The expected life is calculated as &lt;font style=color: #000000;&gt;(i) the mid-point between the average vested date and the contractual expiration of the option for executives and directors and (ii) three years from the average vesting date for all others due to limited exercise history&lt;/font&gt;. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of equity&amp;#8211;based payment awards requires the input of the subjective assumptions described above. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of equity&amp;#8211;based payment awards represent management&amp;#8217;s best estimates
 which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management&amp;#8217;s judgment.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;&gt;Use of estimates&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. The Company bases its estimates on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company&amp;#8217;s results can also be affected by economic
 political
 legislative
 regulatory and legal actions. Economic conditions
 such as recessionary trends
 inflation
 interest and monetary exchange rates
 and government fiscal policies
 can have a significant effect on operations. While the Company maintains reserves for anticipated liabilities and carries various levels of insurance
 the Company could be affected by civil
 criminal
 regulatory or administrative actions
 claims or proceedings.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Significant changes to the key assumptions used in the valuations could result in different fair values of financial instruments at each valuation date.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;&gt;Segment information&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. To date
 the Company has viewed its operations and manages its business as one segment operating in the United States of America. The Company&amp;#8217;s chief operating decision-maker reviews operating results on an aggregated basis. All the assets and operations of the Company are in the United States.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;&gt;Commitments and contingencies&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;We may be involved in legal proceedings
 claims
 and regulatory
 tax
 or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business resulting in loss contingencies. We accrue for loss contingencies when losses become probable and are reasonably estimable. If the reasonable estimate of the loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate
 the minimum amount of the range is recorded as a liability. Legal costs such as outside counsel fees and expenses are charged to expense in the period incurred and are recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;We do not accrue for contingent losses that are considered to be reasonably possible
 but not probable; however
 we disclose the range of such reasonably possible losses. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;We have entered into leases

 Topic 842
 &amp;#8220;Leases (842)&amp;#8221;
 which amends leasing guidance by requiring companies to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all operating and financing leases with lease terms greater than twelve months. The lease liability is equal to the present value of lease payments. The right-of-use lease asset is based on the lease liability
 subject to adjustment for prepaid and deferred rent and tenant incentives. For income statement purposes
 leases will continue to be classified as operating or financing with lease expense in both cases calculated substantially the same as under the prior leasing guidance.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in recognition of right-of-use assets of $0.4 million and operating lease liabilities of $0.4 million as of January 1
 2019. The Company adopted the optional transition method that gives companies the option to use the adoption date as the initial application on transition.&amp;#160; Accordingly
 results for reporting periods beginning prior to January 1
 2019 continue to be reported in accordance with our historical treatment.&amp;#160; The adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations or cash flows.

 2019
 the Company adopted ASU. 2018-07 &amp;#8220;Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting.&amp;#8221; The amendments in this update expanded the scope of ASC 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. The requirements of ASC 718 are applied to nonemployee awards except for specific guidance on inputs to an option pricing model and the attribution of cost. The amendments specify that ASC 718 applies to all share-based payment transactions in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in a grantor&amp;#8217;s own operations by issuing share-based payment awards. The amendments also clarify that ASC 718 does not apply to share-based payments used to effectively provide (1) financing to the issuer or (2) awards granted in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract accounted for under ASC 606
 &amp;#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers.&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company is treating the inclusion of share-based payments to nonemployees as a change in accounting principle prospectively beginning in the period ending January 1
 2019.&amp;#160; The Company did not restate prior periods for share-based compensation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Issued but not Yet Adopted:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-style: italic;&gt;ASU 2016-13 &amp;#8220;Financial Instruments &amp;#8211; Credit Losses (Topic 326)&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;In June 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 &amp;#8220;Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)
&amp;#8221; a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The standard is effective for the Company on January 1
 2023
 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-style: italic;&gt;ASU 2018-13 &amp;#8220;Fair Value Measurement&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-13
 &amp;#8220;Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) Changes to the Disclosure Requirement for Fair Value Measurement&amp;#8221; which amends ASC 820 to expand the disclosures required for items subject to Level 3
 fair value remeasurement
 including the underlying assumptions.&amp;#160; ASU 2018-13 is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019.&amp;#160; The Company is currently evaluating the impact the new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. As this standard only requires additional disclosures
 there is no anticipated financial statement impact of its adoption.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-style: italic;&gt;ASU 2018-15 &amp;#8220;Intangibles &amp;#8211; Goodwill and Other &amp;#8211; Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40)&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-style: italic;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-15 &amp;#8220;Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40)&amp;#8221; to amend ASU 2015-05 in an effort to provide additional guidance on the accounting for costs implementation activities performed in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract.&amp;#160; The amendments in this update align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license).&amp;#160; The accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract is not affected by the amendments in this update.&amp;#160; The amendments in this update also require the entity to present the expense related to the capitalized implementation costs in the same line item in the statement of income as the fees associated with the hosting element (service) of the arrangement and classify payments for capitalizing implementation costs in the statement of cash flows in the same manner as payments made for fees associated with the hosting element.&amp;#160; The entity is also required to present the capitalized implementation costs in the statement of financial position in the same line item that a prepayment for the fees of the associated hosting arrangement would be presented. The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1
 2020
 and early adoption is permitted.&amp;#160; The Company believes that current practices of capitalization versus expensing IT costs are in line with this guidance
 however

 the holders of Series E will be entitled to receive in cash out of the assets of the Company
 whether from capital or from earnings available for distribution to its stockholders
 before any amount shall be paid to the holders of any of shares of common stock
 an amount per share of Series E Preferred equal to the greater of (A) the sum of (1) the Stated Value thereof plus (2) the Additional Amount thereon and any accrued and unpaid Late Charges with respect to such Stated Value and Additional Amount as of such date of determination (the &amp;#8220;Conversion Amount&amp;#8221;) and (B) the amount per share such holder of Series E would receive if such holder converted such Series E into common stock immediately prior to the date of such payment. Liquidation Event means
 whether in a single transaction or series of transactions
 the voluntary or involuntary liquidation
 dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or such Subsidiaries the assets of which constitute all or substantially all of the assets of the business of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries
 taken as a whole.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;&gt;Conversion&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Each holder of Series E will be entitled to convert any portion of the outstanding Series E held by such holder into validly issued
 fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock at the conversion rate. The number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of any share of Series E would be determined by dividing (x) the Conversion Amount of such share of Series E by (y) the conversion price. The Series E has a stated value of $0.99 per share; is convertible to common stock at a price of $0.78 per share.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;&gt;Redemption&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Under certain default conditions
 the Series E is subject to mandatory redemption in cash equal to 125% of the greater of $0.99 per share ($1.23 per share) or 75% of the market price of the common stock. The Series E has a stated value of $0.99 per share; is convertible to common stock at a price of $0.78 per share. Redemption of the Series E also occurs upon Triggering Events
 which are not all entirely within the control of the Company. Due to this redemption option
 the Series E is recorded in the mezzanine equity and subject to subsequent measurement under the guidance provided under FASB ASC 480-10-S99-3A

 &amp;#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers.&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In order to recognize revenue




 which includes the sale of product to e-commerce retailers
 pet specialty chains
 grocery
 mass and distributors
 and direct to consumer
 (&amp;#8220;DTC&amp;#8221;)
 which is focused on driving consumers to directly purchase product through our online web platform.&amp;#160; A significant portion of the Company&amp;#8217;s revenue is derived from the DTC channel which represents 89% of consolidated revenue; the Retail channel represents 11% of consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31
 2019. The revenue channel percentage will change in 2020 with the acquisition of Halo
 as the Halo business is predominantly driven by the Retail channel. The majority of these sales transactions are single performance obligations that are recorded when control is transferred to the customer.&amp;#160; The Company offers a loyalty program to their DTC customer which creates a separate performance obligation upon customer participation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The following is a description of principal activities from which the Company generates its revenue
 by revenue channel.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The Company&amp;#8217;s DTC products are offered through the online stores where customers place orders directly for delivery across the United States. Revenue is recorded
 net of point of sale discounts
 at the time the order is shipped to the customer as this is when it has been determined that control has been transferred
 and includes shipping paid by customers. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration
 net of discounts
 the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring the merchandise. The Company has elected to exclude from revenue all collected sales taxes paid by its customers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Revenue is deferred for orders that have been placed
 and paid for
 but have not yet have been shipped. Based on the historical experience
 the Company records an estimated liability for returns.&amp;#160; Product returns were less than $0.4 million and $0.7 million in 2019 and 2018
 respectively.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;For the Company&amp;#8217;s DTC loyalty program
 a portion of revenue is deferred at the time of the sale as points are earned based on the relative stand-alone selling price
 and not recognized until the redemption of the loyalty points.&amp;#160; The program enables customers to accumulate points based on their spending. For every $1 spent
 customers receive twelve points
 and for every five hundred points earned
 customers will receive a $5 gift card which can be redeemed for goods purchased on-line. The points do not expire and the Company
 based on historical redemption experience estimates a redemption rate of 37%. As of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 customers earned
 but not redeemed
 loyalty program awards amounted to $0.2 million and less than $0.1 million
 respectively. The Company recognized less than $0.2 million as revenue from the loyalty program for the year ended December 31
 2019. There was no revenue recognized for the year ended December 31
 2018 related to the loyalty program.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The amount included in net sales related to recoveries of shipping costs by charging the customer a shipping fee for direct to consumer customers was $0.7 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018

 Compensation &amp;#8211; Stock Compensation. The Company follows the fair value method of accounting for awards granted to employees
 directors
 officers and consultants. Share-based awards are measured at their estimated fair value on each respective grant date. The Company recognizes share-based payment expenses over the vesting period. The Company&amp;#8217;s share-based compensation awards are subject only to service based vesting conditions. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;The fair value of an option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black&amp;#8211;Scholes option valuation model. The Black&amp;#8211;Scholes option valuation model requires the development of assumptions that are inputs into the model. These assumptions are the expected stock volatility
 the risk&amp;#8211;free interest rate
 the expected life of the option and the expected dividend yield which is based on the historical dividends issued by the Company. The Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Expected volatility is calculated based on the analysis of other public companies within the pet wellness
 internet commerce (e-commerce)
 and hemp derived CBD sectors. Risk&amp;#8211;free interest rates are calculated based on risk&amp;#8211;free rates for the appropriate term. The expected life is calculated as &lt;font style=color: #000000;&gt;(i) the mid-point between the average vested date and the contractual expiration of the option for executives and directors and (ii) three years from the average vesting date for all others due to limited exercise history&lt;/font&gt;. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of equity&amp;#8211;based payment awards requires the input of the subjective assumptions described above. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of equity&amp;#8211;based payment awards represent management&amp;#8217;s best estimates

 2019
 the Company acquired the Better Choice Company Inc. 2019 Incentive Award Plan (the &amp;#8220;2019 Plan&amp;#8221;) which became effective as of April 29
 2019. The 2019 Plan provides for the grant of stock options
 stock appreciation rights
 restricted stock
 restricted stock units
 other stock or cash-based awards or a dividend equivalent award (each an &amp;#8220;Award&amp;#8221;). Nonemployee directors of the Company and employees and consultants of the Company or any of its subsidiaries are eligible to receive awards under the 2019 Plan. The 2019 Plan authorizes the issuance of (i) 6
000
000 shares of common stock plus (ii) an annual increase on the first day of each calendar year beginning on January 1
 2020 and ending on and including January 1
 2029
 equal to the lesser of (A) 10% of the shares of common stock outstanding (on an as-converted basis) on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year and (B) such smaller number of shares of common stock as determined by the Board.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Options to purchase an aggregate of 5
250
000 shares of the Company&amp;#8217;s common stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per share were granted to management and nonemployee directors of Better Choice Company on May 2

 Director or Consultant through each vesting date
 the Option shall vest and become exercisable with respect to 1/24th of the Shares subject thereto (rounded down to the next whole number of Shares) on the last day of each month
 beginning with May 31
 2019
 such that the Option shall be fully vested and exercisable on April 30
 2021.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;On November 11
 2019
 the Company received shareholder approval for the Amended and Restated 2019 Incentive Award Plan (the &amp;#8220;Amended 2019 Plan&amp;#8221;).&amp;#160; Under the Amended 2019 Plan
 the number of option awards available for issuance increased from 6
000
000 to 9
000
000 on December 19
 2019.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;Effective as of December 19
 2019
 the Board repriced all outstanding options under the Amended 2019 Plan As a result
 the exercise price of all outstanding vested and unvested options was lowered to $1.82 per share
 the closing price of the Company&amp;#8217;s common stock on December 19
 2019. No other terms of the option agreements were changed.&amp;#160; The change in exercise price of the outstanding options caused an increase in fair value of all vested options at date of repricing of $0.6 million which was expensed by the Company.&amp;#160; The change in exercise price also caused an increase in fair value of all unvested options at date of repricing of $0.8 million.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;As of December 31

 a novel strain of coronavirus (&amp;#8220;COVID-19&amp;#8221;) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan
 China. In January 2020
 the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a &amp;#8220;Public Health Emergency of International Concern.&amp;#8221;&amp;#160; This world-wide outbreak has resulted in the implementation of significant governmental measures
 including lockdowns
 closures
 quarantines and travel bans intended to control the spread of the virus. Companies are also taking precautions
 such as requiring employees to work remotely
 imposing travel restrictions and temporarily closing businesses and facilities. These restrictions
 and future prevention and mitigation measures
 are likely to have an adverse impact on global economic conditions and consumer confidence and spending
 which could materially adversely affect the supply of as well as the demand for our products. Uncertainties regarding the economic impact of COVID-19 is likely to result in sustained market turmoil
 which could also negatively impact our business
 financial condition and cash flows.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: justify;&gt;We source our products from suppliers and manufacturers located in the United States and New Zealand. The impact of COVID-19 on these suppliers
 or any of our other suppliers

 distributors or transportation or logistics providers
 may negatively affect the price and availability of our ingredients and/or packaging materials and impact our supply chain. If the disruptions caused by COVID-19 continue for an extended period of time
 our ability to meet the demands of our customers may be materially impacted. To date
 we have not experienced any reduction in the available supply of our products. As of March 2020
 the United States Department of Homeland Security has classified businesses that manufacture
 produce and supply pet food as &amp;#8220;Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers.&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: justify;&gt;We depend on a logistics partner and our warehouse facilities located in Tampa
 Florida. If we are forced to scale back hours of operation or close these facilities in response to the pandemic
 we expect our business
 financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: justify;&gt;Additionally
 many of our employees
 including members of our management team
 have been reporting to work remotely due to the COVID-19 outbreak
 which has resulted in the closure of our offices in Florida and New York. If our operations or productivity continue to be impacted throughout the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak and government-mandated closures
 which may negatively impact our business
 financial condition and cash flows. The extent to which COVID-19 pandemic will further impact our business will depend on future developments and
 given the uncertainty around the extent and timing of the potential future spread or mitigation and around the imposition or relaxation of protective measures
 we cannot reasonably estimate the impact to our business at this time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify; color: #000000;&gt;The extent of COVID-19&amp;#8217;s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments
 including the duration
 spread and intensity of the outbreak
 all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape. As a result
 it is not currently possible to ascertain the overall impact of COVID-19 on our business. However
 if the pandemic continues to evolve into a severe worldwide health crisis
 the disease could have a material adverse effect on our business
 results of operations
 financial condition and cash flows and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=text-align: justify;&gt;On March 27

 President Trump signed into law the CARES Act.&amp;#160; The CARES Act
 among other things
 includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits
 deferment of employer side social security payments
 net operating loss carryback periods
 alternative minimum tax credit refunds
 modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property.&amp;#160; We continue to examine the impacts this CARES Act may have on our business On April 10

 2019
 the Company entered into a radio advertising agreement with iHeartMedia + Entertainment
 Inc. and issued 1
000
000 shares of common stock valued at $3.4 million for future advertising to be provided to the Company from August 2019 to August 2021.&amp;#160; During the year ended December 31
 2019
 $0.6 million of the $3.4 million of the prepaid advertising was incurred. In addition
 the agreement required the Company to spend a minimum amount for talent fees or other direct iHeart costs. The company has committed to using $1.7 million of the media inventory by August 28
 2020
 with the remainder of the inventory available through August 28
 2021. The Company expensed $0.6 million of the media inventory for the year ended December 31
 2019
 reducing the prepaid advertising balance to $2.8 million

 dependence on key personnel
 competitive forces
 successful marketing and sale of its products
 the successful protection of its proprietary technologies
 ability to grow into new markets
 and compliance with government regulations. In December 2019
 a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan
 China. Uncertainties regarding the economic impact of COVID-19
 the disease caused by the novel coronavirus
 are likely to result in sustained market turmoil
 which could also negatively impact our business
 financial condition
 and cash flows. The Company has incurred losses over the last three years and has an accumulated deficit. The Company continues to rely on current investors and the public markets to finance these losses through debt and/or equity issuance. These operating losses and the outstanding debt create substantial doubt about the Company&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the date these consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company is implementing plans to achieve cost savings and other strategic objectives to address these conditions. The Company expects cost savings from consolidation of third-party manufacturers
 optimizing shipping and warehousing as well as overhead cost reductions. The business is focused on growing the most profitable channels while reducing investments in areas that are expected to have long-term benefits. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates the realization of assets and payments of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly

TruPet line of credit
In May 2017
 TruPet along with the majority owners serving as co-borrowers entered into a line of credit providing for up to $2.0 million of borrowings secured by the personal assets of the two majority owners. Through various amendments
 the maximum borrowings under the credit facility increased to $4.6 million as of December 31
 2018
 with a maturity of May 2019. Borrowings bore interest at LIBOR plus 3% and were repaid on May 6
 2019. At December 31
 2018
The line of credit was secured by personal assets of the co-borrowers
 as noted above. Covenants under the line of credit required TruPet to be within certain restrictions. As of December 31
 2018
At December 31
 2018
 due to related party consisted of a $1.6 million unsecured note payable to a director of TruPet bearing 26.6% interest with principal and interest due within 30 days after change of control
 as described below.&#160; On May 6
 2019
 this loan was repaid. There was no accrued interest recorded at either December 31
 2018 or December 31
On May 6
 2019
 Better Choice Company refinanced the $4.6 million credit facility and the $1.6 million note payable to a director with a $6.2 million revolving line of credit with a financial institution. The $6.2 million revolving line of credit was secured by restricted cash held in a money market account. In connection with the consummation of the Halo Acquisition
 the Company terminated the $6.2 million revolving line of credit. Early termination of the revolving line of credit did not trigger any premiums or penalties
On the Halo Acquisition Date
 the Company entered into a Loan Facilities Agreement (the &#8220;Facilities Agreement&#8221;) by and among the Company
 as the borrower
 the several lenders from time to time parties thereto (collectively
 the &#8220;Lenders&#8221;) and a private debt lender
 as agent (the &#8220;Agent&#8221;).

On May 6
 2019
 Better Choice Company Inc. completed the acquisition of TruPet LLC (&#8220;TruPet&#8221;) and Bona Vida Inc. (&#8220;Bona Vida&#8221;) in a pair of all stock transactions (together referred to as the &#8220;May Acquisitions&#8221;) through the issuance of 33
130
806 shares of common stock
 par value $0.001
 of the Company. Following the completion of the May Acquisitions
The Company is the legal acquirer of TruPet and Bona Vida. However
 the May Acquisitions were treated as a reverse acquisition whereby TruPet acquired the Company and Bona Vida for accounting and financial reporting purposes. As a result
 the financial statements for the year ending December 31
 2019 are comprised of (1) the results of TruPet for the period between January 1
 2019 and December 31
 2019
 (2) the results of the Company and Bona Vida
 after giving effect to the May Acquisitions on May 6
 2019 through December 31
 2019 and (3) the results of the Company and Halo
 after giving effect to the Halo Acquisition (see &#8220;Note 2 &#8211; Acquisitions&#8221;) on December 19
 2019 through December 31
 2019. The financial statements for the year ended December 31
 2018 and all periods presented prior to the effective date of the May Acquisitions on May 6

 and therefore
On December 19

 the Company acquired 100% of all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Halo
 a Delaware corporation (the &#8220;Halo Acquisition&#8221;). Where the context allows
References to the &#8220;Company&#8221;
 &#8220;we&#8221;

 2019
 to Better Choice Company
 TruPet and Bona Vida and their consolidated subsidiaries after May 6
 2019 and to Better Choice Company
 TruPet
 Bona Vida and Halo and their consolidated subsidiaries after December 19
The Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for annual financial reports and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis subsequent to the Acquisitions and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management
Historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future. The significant accounting policies applied by the Company are described below. We present our tables in U.S. dollars (thousands) and percentage as rounded up or down. In the notes
 we represent US dollars (millions) and percentage as rounded up or down.




The Company is subject to risks common in the pet wellness consumer market including
 but not limited to
 dependence on key personnel
 competitive forces
 successful marketing and sale of its products
 the successful protection of its proprietary technologies
 ability to grow into new markets
 and compliance with government regulations. In December 2019
 a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan
 China. Uncertainties regarding the economic impact of COVID-19
 the disease caused by the novel coronavirus
 are likely to result in sustained market turmoil
 which could also negatively impact our business
 financial condition
 and cash flows. The Company has incurred losses over the last three years and has an accumulated deficit. The Company continues to rely on current investors and the public markets to finance these losses through debt and/or equity issuance. These operating losses and the outstanding debt create substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the date these consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company is implementing plans to achieve cost savings and other strategic objectives to address these conditions. The Company expects cost savings from consolidation of third-party manufacturers
 optimizing shipping and warehousing as well as overhead cost reductions. The business is focused on growing the most profitable channels while reducing investments in areas that are expected to have long-term benefits. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates the realization of assets and payments of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly
 the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount of and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.




Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits held with banks and highly liquid investments with original maturities of ninety days or less at acquisition date. For purposes of reporting cash flows
 the Company considers all cash accounts that are not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties to be cash and cash equivalents.




At December 31
 2019
 the Company had $0.2 million in restricted cash. The Company is required to maintain a restricted cash balance of less than $0.2 million associated with a business credit card and credit card clearance operations. The Company did not have any restricted cash at December 31
 2018.




Accounts receivable primarily consist of unpaid buyer invoices from the Company&#8217;s Retail customers and credit card payments receivable from third-party credit card processing companies. Accounts receivable is stated at the amount billed to customers
 net of point of sale and cash discounts. The Company assesses the collectability of all receivables on an ongoing basis by considering its historical credit loss experience
 current economic conditions
 and other relevant factors. Based on this analysis
 an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded. The provision for doubtful accounts is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company recorded less than $0.1 million allowance for doubtful accounts for the year ended December 31
 2019. For the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Company considered accounts receivable to be fully collectible and
 accordingly
 no allowance for doubtful accounts was recorded.




Inventories
 primarily consisting of products available for sale and supplies
 are valued using the first-in first-out (&#8220;FIFO&#8221;) method and are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on a standard cost basis and includes the purchase price
The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand. Excess or obsolete reserves are established when inventory is estimated to not be sellable before expiration dates based on forecasted usage
 product demand and product life cycle.&#160; Additionally
 inventory valuation reflects adjustments for anticipated physical inventory losses
 such as shrink
 that have occurred since the last physical inventory.









Goodwill of $18.6 million was recognized as of December 31
 2019 in connection with the Halo Acquisition. In future years
 the Company will complete an annual impairment test for goodwill that includes an assessment of qualitative factors including
 but not limited to
 macroeconomic conditions
 industry and market conditions
 and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance.&#160; The Company will perform annual impairment tests as of October 31st beginning in 2020 or earlier if indicators of impairment exist.&#160; There were no indicators of goodwill impairment as of December 31
 2019.




Intangible assets acquired are carried at cost
 less accumulated amortization. The Company reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and any not expected to be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows are written down to current fair value. The Company acquired an intangible asset related to the Houndog license with the acquisition of Bona Vida an May 6
 2019. The Company fully impaired the asset as of December 31
 2019 as we terminated the contract on January 13
 2020. The Company acquired intangible assets with the acquisition of Halo on December 19
 2019. We will review impairment of the assets acquired beginning in the fiscal year ending on December 31
 2020 given the proximity of the Halo Acquisition to year-end.




In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 480
 &#8220;Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (ASC 480)&#8221;
 preferred stock issued with redemption provisions that are outside of the control of the Company or that contain certain redemption rights in a deemed liquidation event is required to be presented outside of stockholders&#8217; deficit on the face of the consolidated balance sheet. The Company&#8217;s Redeemable Series E Convertible Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Series E&#8221;) contains redemption provisions that require it to be presented outside of stockholders&#8217; deficit. Changes in the redemption value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock
 if any
 are recorded immediately in the period occurred as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet.




Income taxes are recorded in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740
 &#8220;Income Taxes (ASC 740)&#8221;
 which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for loss and credit carryforwards using enacted tax rates anticipated to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided
 if
 based upon the weight of available evidence
The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist
 the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that some or all the benefit will more likely than not be realized. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position
 as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. As of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company does not have any significant uncertain income tax positions. If incurred
The Company was incorporated on May 6
 2019. Prior to this date
 the Company operated as a flow through entity for state and United States federal tax purposes. The Company files a U.S. federal and state income tax return
 including for its wholly owned subsidiaries.




The Company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods in accordance with the provisions of ASC 606
In order to recognize revenue
TruPet adopted ASC 606 on January 1
 2017. Accordingly all periods presented reflect the recognition of revenue and related disclosures required by ASC 606.




Cost of goods sold consists primarily of the cost of product obtained from third-party contract manufacturing plants
 packaging materials
 CBD oils directly sourced by the Company
 inventory freight for shipping product from third-party contract manufacturing plants to the Company&#8217;s warehouse and third party fulfillment and royalties.




General and administrative expenses include management and office personnel compensation
 share-based compensation
 bonuses
 information technology related costs
 rent
 travel
 professional service fees
 insurance
 product development costs
 outbound shipping and general corporate expenses.




The Company charges advertising costs to expense as incurred and such charges are included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Our advertising expenses consisting primarily of online advertising
 search costs
 email advertising
 and radio advertising. In addition
 with the acquisition of Halo
 we reimburse our customers and third parties for in store activities and record these costs as sales and marketing expenses. Advertising costs were $6.7 million and $3.9 million for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.









The Company&#8217;s financial instruments recognized on the balance sheets consist of cash and cash equivalents
 restricted cash
 accounts receivable
 prepaid deposits
 accounts payable
 short term loan
 line of credit
 subordinated convertible notes
 accrued liabilities
 other liabilities
The Company uses applicable guidance for defining fair value
 the initial recording and periodic remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value
 and related disclosures for instruments measured at fair value. Fair value accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability for which there is little
 if any
 market activity at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company&#8217;s own assumptions about what market participants would use to price the asset or liability. The inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances
 which may include the Company&#8217;s own financial data
 such as internally developed pricing models
 discounted cash flow methodologies
Fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities reflect Level 3 inputs and are primarily used to measure the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations
 for goodwill
 other intangible assets and long-lived assets impairment analyses and the valuation of acquired intangibles.




Basic and diluted loss per share has been determined by dividing the net and comprehensive loss available to common stockholders for the applicable period by the basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding
 respectively. Common stock equivalents and incentive shares are excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share when their effect is anti-dilutive.




The Company recognizes compensation expense for all share&#8211;based payments in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718
 Compensation &#8211; Stock Compensation. The Company follows the fair value method of accounting for awards granted to employees
 directors
The fair value of an option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black&#8211;Scholes option valuation model. The Black&#8211;Scholes option valuation model requires the development of assumptions that are inputs into the model. These assumptions are the expected stock volatility
 the risk&#8211;free interest rate
 the expected life of the option and the expected dividend yield which is based on the historical dividends issued by the Company. The Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Expected volatility is calculated based on the analysis of other public companies within the pet wellness
 internet commerce (e-commerce)
. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of equity&#8211;based payment awards requires the input of the subjective assumptions described above. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of equity&#8211;based payment awards represent management&#8217;s best estimates
 which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management&#8217;s judgment.




The Company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. The Company bases its estimates on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances
The Company&#8217;s results can also be affected by economic
 political
 legislative
 regulatory and legal actions. Economic conditions
 such as recessionary trends
 inflation
 interest and monetary exchange rates
 and government fiscal policies
 can have a significant effect on operations. While the Company maintains reserves for anticipated liabilities and carries various levels of insurance
 the Company could be affected by civil
 criminal
 regulatory or administrative actions
 claims or proceedings.&#160;&#160; Significant changes to the key assumptions used in the valuations could result in different fair values of financial instruments at each valuation date.




Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. To date
 the Company has viewed its operations and manages its business as one segment operating in the United States of America. The Company&#8217;s chief operating decision-maker reviews operating results on an aggregated basis. All the assets and operations of the Company are in the United States.




We may be involved in legal proceedings
 claims
 and regulatory
 tax
 or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business resulting in loss contingencies. We accrue for loss contingencies when losses become probable and are reasonably estimable. If the reasonable estimate of the loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate
We do not accrue for contingent losses that are considered to be reasonably possible
 but not probable; however
We have entered into leases
 a royalty contract termination (see &#8220;Note 22 &#8211; Subsequent events&#8221;) and debt instruments
 including a line of credit
In connection with the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company identified an error as of December 31
 2018 related to an understatement of sales taxes due and payable of $0.7 million. The error was corrected during the year ended December 31
 2019. The Company believes that the correction of this error is not material to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31
 2019 or 2018
 respectively.









The Company has reviewed the Accounting Standards Update (ASU)
In February 2016
 the Financial Accounting Standard Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2016-02
 Topic 842
 &#8220;Leases (842)&#8221;
 which amends leasing guidance by requiring companies to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all operating and financing leases with lease terms greater than twelve months. The lease liability is equal to the present value of lease payments. The right-of-use lease asset is based on the lease liability
 subject to adjustment for prepaid and deferred rent and tenant incentives. For income statement purposes
The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in recognition of right-of-use assets of $0.4 million and operating lease liabilities of $0.4 million as of January 1
 2019. The Company adopted the optional transition method that gives companies the option to use the adoption date as the initial application on transition.&#160; Accordingly
 results for reporting periods beginning prior to January 1
On January 1
 2019
 the Company adopted ASU. 2018-07 &#8220;Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting.&#8221; The amendments in this update expanded the scope of ASC 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. The requirements of ASC 718 are applied to nonemployee awards except for specific guidance on inputs to an option pricing model and the attribution of cost. The amendments specify that ASC 718 applies to all share-based payment transactions in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in a grantor&#8217;s own operations by issuing share-based payment awards. The amendments also clarify that ASC 718 does not apply to share-based payments used to effectively provide (1) financing to the issuer or (2) awards granted in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract accounted for under ASC 606
The Company is treating the inclusion of share-based payments to nonemployees as a change in accounting principle prospectively beginning in the period ending January 1
In June 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 &#8220;Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)
&#8221; a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The standard is effective for the Company on January 1
 2023
In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-13
 &#8220;Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) Changes to the Disclosure Requirement for Fair Value Measurement&#8221; which amends ASC 820 to expand the disclosures required for items subject to Level 3
 fair value remeasurement
 including the underlying assumptions.&#160; ASU 2018-13 is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019.&#160; The Company is currently evaluating the impact the new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. As this standard only requires additional disclosures
In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-15 &#8220;Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40)&#8221; to amend ASU 2015-05 in an effort to provide additional guidance on the accounting for costs implementation activities performed in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract.&#160; The amendments in this update align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license).&#160; The accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract is not affected by the amendments in this update.&#160; The amendments in this update also require the entity to present the expense related to the capitalized implementation costs in the same line item in the statement of income as the fees associated with the hosting element (service) of the arrangement and classify payments for capitalizing implementation costs in the statement of cash flows in the same manner as payments made for fees associated with the hosting element.&#160; The entity is also required to present the capitalized implementation costs in the statement of financial position in the same line item that a prepayment for the fees of the associated hosting arrangement would be presented. The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1
 2020
 and early adoption is permitted.&#160; The Company believes that current practices of capitalization versus expensing IT costs are in line with this guidance
 however
 the amendment will require the Company to change presentation within the statement of cash flows. The Company currently has no internal use software and expects this accounting standard will have no impact on its consolidated financial statements.

For the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
For the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Company was a Limited Liability Company
 taxed as a partnership.&#160; Thus
 all of the Company&#8217;s income and losses flowed through to the owners.&#160; Furthermore
The Company&#8217;s effective tax rate differs from the United States federal statutory rate of 21% primarily because the Company&#8217;s losses have been fully offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertainty as to the realization of the tax benefit of net operating losses (&#8220;NOLs&#8221;) for the year ended December 31
 2019. The following table is a reconciliation of the components that caused our provision for income taxes to differ from amounts computed by applying the United States federal statutory rate of 21% for the year ended December 31

The Internal Revenue Code
 as amended (&#8220;IRC&#8221;)
 imposes restrictions on the utilization of NOLs and other tax attributes in the event of an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; of a corporation. Accordingly
 a company&#8217;s ability to use pre-change NOLs may be limited as prescribed under IRC Section 382. Events which may cause limitation in the amount of the NOLs and credits that can be utilized annually include

Under ASC 805

Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets in the future. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred through the year ended December 31
 2019 and 2018. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective positive evidence such as current year taxable income and future income projections. On the basis of this evaluation

Better Choice Company Inc. is a rapidly growing animal health and wellness company committed to leading the industry shift toward pet products and services that help dogs and cats live heathier
 happier and longer lives. We take an alternative
 nutrition-based approach to animal health relative to conventional dog and cat food offerings
 and position our portfolio of brands to benefit from the mainstream trends of growing pet humanization and consumer focus on health and wellness.&#160; We have a demonstrated
 multi-decade track record of success selling trusted animal health and wellness products

 cat food and treats under the Halo and TruDog brands
 which are focused
 respectively
 on providing sustainably sourced kibble and canned food derived from real whole meat
On May 6
 2019
 Better Choice Company Inc. completed the acquisition of TruPet LLC (&#8220;TruPet&#8221;) and Bona Vida Inc. (&#8220;Bona Vida&#8221;) in a pair of all stock transactions (together referred to as the &#8220;May Acquisitions&#8221;) through the issuance of 33
130
806 shares of common stock
 par value $0.001
 of the Company. Following the completion of the May Acquisitions
The Company is the legal acquirer of TruPet and Bona Vida. However
 the May Acquisitions were treated as a reverse acquisition whereby TruPet acquired the Company and Bona Vida for accounting and financial reporting purposes. As a result
 the financial statements for the year ending December 31
 2019 are comprised of (1) the results of TruPet for the period between January 1
 2019 and December 31
 2019
 (2) the results of the Company and Bona Vida
 after giving effect to the May Acquisitions on May 6
 2019 through December 31
 2019 and (3) the results of the Company and Halo
 after giving effect to the Halo Acquisition (see &#8220;Note 2 &#8211; Acquisitions&#8221;) on December 19
 2019 through December 31
 2019. The financial statements for the year ended December 31
 2018 and all periods presented prior to the effective date of the May Acquisitions on May 6
 2019 are comprised solely of the operations and financial position of TruPet
 and therefore
On December 19
 2019
 the Company acquired 100% of all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Halo
 a Delaware corporation (the &#8220;Halo Acquisition&#8221;). Where the context allows

 TruPet and Bona Vida and their consolidated subsidiaries after May 6
 2019 and to Better Choice Company
 TruPet
 Bona Vida and Halo and their consolidated subsidiaries after December 19
The Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for annual financial reports and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis subsequent to the Acquisitions and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management
Historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future. The significant accounting policies applied by the Company are described below. We present our tables in U.S. dollars (thousands) and percentage as rounded up or down. In the notes
The Company is subject to risks common in the pet wellness consumer market including
 but not limited to
 dependence on key personnel
 competitive forces
 successful marketing and sale of its products
 the successful protection of its proprietary technologies
 ability to grow into new markets
 and compliance with government regulations. In December 2019
 a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan
 China. Uncertainties regarding the economic impact of COVID-19
 the disease caused by the novel coronavirus
 are likely to result in sustained market turmoil
 which could also negatively impact our business
 financial condition
 and cash flows. The Company has incurred losses over the last three years and has an accumulated deficit. The Company continues to rely on current investors and the public markets to finance these losses through debt and/or equity issuance. These operating losses and the outstanding debt create substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the date these consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company is implementing plans to achieve cost savings and other strategic objectives to address these conditions. The Company expects cost savings from consolidation of third-party manufacturers
 optimizing shipping and warehousing as well as overhead cost reductions. The business is focused on growing the most profitable channels while reducing investments in areas that are expected to have long-term benefits. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates the realization of assets and payments of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly
Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits held with banks and highly liquid investments with original maturities of ninety days or less at acquisition date. For purposes of reporting cash flows
At December 31
 2019
 the Company had $0.2 million in restricted cash. The Company is required to maintain a restricted cash balance of less than $0.2 million associated with a business credit card and credit card clearance operations. The Company did not have any restricted cash at December 31
Accounts receivable primarily consist of unpaid buyer invoices from the Company&#8217;s Retail customers and credit card payments receivable from third-party credit card processing companies. Accounts receivable is stated at the amount billed to customers
 net of point of sale and cash discounts. The Company assesses the collectability of all receivables on an ongoing basis by considering its historical credit loss experience
 current economic conditions
 and other relevant factors. Based on this analysis
 an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded. The provision for doubtful accounts is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company recorded less than $0.1 million allowance for doubtful accounts for the year ended December 31
 2019. For the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Company considered accounts receivable to be fully collectible and
 accordingly
Inventories
 primarily consisting of products available for sale and supplies
 are valued using the first-in first-out (&#8220;FIFO&#8221;) method and are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on a standard cost basis and includes the purchase price
The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand. Excess or obsolete reserves are established when inventory is estimated to not be sellable before expiration dates based on forecasted usage
 product demand and product life cycle.&#160; Additionally
 inventory valuation reflects adjustments for anticipated physical inventory losses
 such as shrink
Goodwill of $18.6 million was recognized as of December 31
 2019 in connection with the Halo Acquisition. In future years
 the Company will complete an annual impairment test for goodwill that includes an assessment of qualitative factors including
 but not limited to
 macroeconomic conditions
 industry and market conditions
 and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance.&#160; The Company will perform annual impairment tests as of October 31st beginning in 2020 or earlier if indicators of impairment exist.&#160; There were no indicators of goodwill impairment as of December 31
Intangible assets acquired are carried at cost
 less accumulated amortization. The Company reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and any not expected to be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows are written down to current fair value. The Company acquired an intangible asset related to the Houndog license with the acquisition of Bona Vida an May 6
 2019. The Company fully impaired the asset as of December 31
 2019 as we terminated the contract on January 13
 2020. The Company acquired intangible assets with the acquisition of Halo on December 19
 2019. We will review impairment of the assets acquired beginning in the fiscal year ending on December 31

 &#8220;Income Taxes (ASC 740)&#8221;
 which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns.

The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist
 the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that some or all the benefit will more likely than not be realized. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position
 as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. As of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company does not have any significant uncertain income tax positions. If incurred

The Company&#8217;s financial instruments recognized on the balance sheets consist of cash and cash equivalents
 restricted cash
 accounts receivable

 short term loan
 line of credit
 subordinated convertible notes

The Company uses applicable guidance for defining fair value
 the initial recording and periodic remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value
 and related disclosures for instruments measured at fair value. Fair value accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability for which there is little
 if any
 market activity at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company&#8217;s own assumptions about what market participants would use to price the asset or liability. The inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances
 which may include the Company&#8217;s own financial data
 such as internally developed pricing models
 discounted cash flow methodologies
Fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities reflect Level 3 inputs and are primarily used to measure the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations
 for goodwill
Basic and diluted loss per share has been determined by dividing the net and comprehensive loss available to common stockholders for the applicable period by the basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding
The Company recognizes compensation expense for all share&#8211;based payments in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718
 Compensation &#8211; Stock Compensation. The Company follows the fair value method of accounting for awards granted to employees
 directors
The fair value of an option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black&#8211;Scholes option valuation model. The Black&#8211;Scholes option valuation model requires the development of assumptions that are inputs into the model. These assumptions are the expected stock volatility
 the risk&#8211;free interest rate
 the expected life of the option and the expected dividend yield which is based on the historical dividends issued by the Company. The Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Expected volatility is calculated based on the analysis of other public companies within the pet wellness
 internet commerce (e-commerce)
. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of equity&#8211;based payment awards requires the input of the subjective assumptions described above. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of equity&#8211;based payment awards represent management&#8217;s best estimates
The Company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. The Company bases its estimates on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances
The Company&#8217;s results can also be affected by economic
 political
 legislative
 regulatory and legal actions. Economic conditions
 such as recessionary trends
 inflation
 interest and monetary exchange rates
 and government fiscal policies
 can have a significant effect on operations. While the Company maintains reserves for anticipated liabilities and carries various levels of insurance
 the Company could be affected by civil
 criminal
 regulatory or administrative actions
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. To date
We may be involved in legal proceedings
 claims
 and regulatory
 tax
 or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business resulting in loss contingencies. We accrue for loss contingencies when losses become probable and are reasonably estimable. If the reasonable estimate of the loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate
We do not accrue for contingent losses that are considered to be reasonably possible
 but not probable; however
We have entered into leases
 a royalty contract termination (see &#8220;Note 22 &#8211; Subsequent events&#8221;) and debt instruments
 including a line of credit
In connection with the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company identified an error as of December 31
 2018 related to an understatement of sales taxes due and payable of $0.7 million. The error was corrected during the year ended December 31
 2019. The Company believes that the correction of this error is not material to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31
 2019 or 2018
The Company has reviewed the Accounting Standards Update (ASU)
In February 2016
 the Financial Accounting Standard Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2016-02
 Topic 842
 &#8220;Leases (842)&#8221;
 which amends leasing guidance by requiring companies to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all operating and financing leases with lease terms greater than twelve months. The lease liability is equal to the present value of lease payments. The right-of-use lease asset is based on the lease liability
 subject to adjustment for prepaid and deferred rent and tenant incentives. For income statement purposes
The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in recognition of right-of-use assets of $0.4 million and operating lease liabilities of $0.4 million as of January 1
 2019. The Company adopted the optional transition method that gives companies the option to use the adoption date as the initial application on transition.&#160; Accordingly
 results for reporting periods beginning prior to January 1
On January 1
 2019
 the Company adopted ASU. 2018-07 &#8220;Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting.&#8221; The amendments in this update expanded the scope of ASC 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. The requirements of ASC 718 are applied to nonemployee awards except for specific guidance on inputs to an option pricing model and the attribution of cost. The amendments specify that ASC 718 applies to all share-based payment transactions in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in a grantor&#8217;s own operations by issuing share-based payment awards. The amendments also clarify that ASC 718 does not apply to share-based payments used to effectively provide (1) financing to the issuer or (2) awards granted in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract accounted for under ASC 606
The Company is treating the inclusion of share-based payments to nonemployees as a change in accounting principle prospectively beginning in the period ending January 1
In June 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 &#8220;Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)
&#8221; a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The standard is effective for the Company on January 1
 2023
In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-13
 &#8220;Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) Changes to the Disclosure Requirement for Fair Value Measurement&#8221; which amends ASC 820 to expand the disclosures required for items subject to Level 3
 fair value remeasurement
 including the underlying assumptions.&#160; ASU 2018-13 is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019.&#160; The Company is currently evaluating the impact the new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. As this standard only requires additional disclosures
In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-15 &#8220;Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40)&#8221; to amend ASU 2015-05 in an effort to provide additional guidance on the accounting for costs implementation activities performed in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract.&#160; The amendments in this update align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license).&#160; The accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract is not affected by the amendments in this update.&#160; The amendments in this update also require the entity to present the expense related to the capitalized implementation costs in the same line item in the statement of income as the fees associated with the hosting element (service) of the arrangement and classify payments for capitalizing implementation costs in the statement of cash flows in the same manner as payments made for fees associated with the hosting element.&#160; The entity is also required to present the capitalized implementation costs in the statement of financial position in the same line item that a prepayment for the fees of the associated hosting arrangement would be presented. The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1
 2020
 and early adoption is permitted.&#160; The Company believes that current practices of capitalization versus expensing IT costs are in line with this guidance
 however
 the amendment will require the Company to change presentation within the statement of cash flows. The Company currently has no internal use software and expects this accounting standard will have no impact on its consolidated financial statements.

On October 15
 2019
 the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Halo Agreement&#8221;) to acquire Halo
 a Delaware corporation. Halo is an ultra-premium
 natural pet food brand. The strategic objective of the acquisition was to accelerate the growth of the Company&#8217;s animal health platform by acquiring an all-encompassing
 global
 animal health and wellness consumer product goods company. Under the terms of the Halo Agreement
 the Company completed the Halo Acquisition on December 19
 2019 (the &#8220;Halo Acquisition Date&#8221;)
 for $38.2 million. The consideration was subject to customary adjustments for Halo&#8217;s net working capital
 cash
 and indebtedness
 and consisted of a combination of (i) cash consideration of $20.5 million
 (ii) 2
134
390 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock
 par value $0.001 per share ($3.9 million)
 (iii) Seller Notes totaling $15
000

 and (iv) 937
500 Seller Warrants ($0.3 million). The Company incurred $0.9 million in transaction costs
The Halo Acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting
 and accordingly

The intangible assets acquired relate to customer relationships and trade name. The intangible asset related to customer relationships reflects the estimated net present value of the future cash flows associated with the stable and recurring customer base acquired in the Halo Acquisition. The fair value was determined using an income approach
 which recognizes that the fair value of an asset is premised upon the expected receipt of future economic benefits such as earnings and cash inflows based on current sales projections and estimated direct costs for each product line. Acquired customer relationships are finite-lived intangible assets and are amortized over their estimated life of 7 years using the straight-line method
 which approximates the customer attrition rate
All of Halo&#8217;s products and services are sold under the &#8220;Halo&#8221; trade name
 and each major product is identified by this trade name. The trade name of the Company was valued on an income approach using a 2% royalty rate which is supported by both market royalty rate data and profitability factors of Halo. The trade name is a finite-lived intangible asset and is being amortized over its estimated life of 15 years using the straight-line method
The excess of purchase price over the fair value amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed represents goodwill from the acquisition. The Company believes the factors that contributed to goodwill include the acquisition of a talented workforce and administrative cost synergies. The Company does not expect any portion of this goodwill to be deductible for tax purposes. See &#8220;Note 9 &#8211; Intangible assets
The following pro forma results reflect only pro forma adjustments for additional interest expense to fund the Halo Acquisition
 amortization of deferred financing costs related to short term loan and line of credit
 reduction in interest expense associated with the repayment of the Halo debt on the Halo Acquisition Date
 amortization of identifiable intangible assets associated with the Halo Acquisition
 share-based compensation expense related to stock options granted and effects of adjustments made to carrying values of acquired assets and liabilities. However
 pro forma results do not include any anticipated synergies from the acquisition of Halo and accordingly

The Company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for the goods. The Company has two categories of revenue channels: retail-partner based (&#8220;Retail&#8221;)
 which includes the sale of product to e-commerce retailers
 pet specialty chains
 grocery
 mass and distributors
 and direct to consumer
 (&#8220;DTC&#8221;)
 which is focused on driving consumers to directly purchase product through our online web platform.&#160; A significant portion of the Company&#8217;s revenue is derived from the DTC channel which represents 89% of consolidated revenue; the Retail channel represents 11% of consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31
 2019. The revenue channel percentage will change in 2020 with the acquisition of Halo
The following is a description of principal activities from which the Company generates its revenue
The Company&#8217;s DTC products are offered through the online stores where customers place orders directly for delivery across the United States. Revenue is recorded
 net of point of sale discounts
 at the time the order is shipped to the customer as this is when it has been determined that control has been transferred
 and includes shipping paid by customers. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration
 net of discounts
Revenue is deferred for orders that have been placed
 and paid for
 but have not yet have been shipped. Based on the historical experience
 the Company records an estimated liability for returns.&#160; Product returns were less than $0.4 million and $0.7 million in 2019 and 2018
For the Company&#8217;s DTC loyalty program
 a portion of revenue is deferred at the time of the sale as points are earned based on the relative stand-alone selling price
 and not recognized until the redemption of the loyalty points.&#160; The program enables customers to accumulate points based on their spending. For every $1 spent
 customers receive twelve points
 and for every five hundred points earned
 customers will receive a $5 gift card which can be redeemed for goods purchased on-line. The points do not expire and the Company
 based on historical redemption experience estimates a redemption rate of 37%. As of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 customers earned
 but not redeemed
 loyalty program awards amounted to $0.2 million and less than $0.1 million
 respectively. The Company recognized less than $0.2 million as revenue from the loyalty program for the year ended December 31
 2019. There was no revenue recognized for the year ended December 31
The amount included in net sales related to recoveries of shipping costs by charging the customer a shipping fee for direct to consumer customers was $0.7 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
Revenue for Retail sales are recognized when the product is shipped to the Retail customer as this is when it has been determined that control has been transferred
 the majority of Retail customers pick up their orders.&#160; There is an exception with one key customer with specific FOB destination shipping terms as this is when it has been determined that control has transferred. Shipping costs associated with moving finished products to customers through third party carriers were $2.3 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.



































The entire disclosure of revenue from contract with customer to transfer good or service and to transfer nonfinancial asset. Includes
 but is not limited to
 disaggregation of revenue
 credit loss recognized from contract with customer
 judgment and change in judgment related to contract with customer
 and asset recognized from cost incurred to obtain or fulfill contract with customer. Excludes insurance and lease contracts.

The Company has historically collected and remitted sales tax based on the locations of its significant physical operations. On June 21
 2018
 the U.S. Supreme Court rendered a 5-4 majority decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc.
 17-494. Among other things
 the Court held that a state may require an out-of-state seller with no physical presence in the state to collect and remit sales taxes on goods the seller ships to consumers in the state
 overturning existing court precedent. The Company discovered that TruPet had not collected and paid sales tax related to all sales in some states where it had a physical presence.&#160; The Company recognized $1.2 million and no sales tax liability as of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.&#160; While additional assessments are not anticipated
 additional states may assert that the Company has nexus and must pay sales tax for prior sales.&#160; The Company does not believe that additional assessments

In connection with the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Company identified an error as of December 31
 2018 related to an understatement of sales taxes due and payable of $0.7 million. The error was corrected during the year ended December 31
 2019. The Company believes that the correction of this error is not material to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31
 2019.

Effective January 1
 2019
 the Company adopted the FASB guidance on leases (&#8220;Topic 842&#8221;)
 which requires leases with durations greater than twelve months to be recognized on the balance sheet. The Company adopted Topic 842 using the modified retrospective transition approach.&#160; Prior year financial statements were not recast under Topic 842
 and therefore those amounts are not disclosed. The Company has elected certain practical expedients
 including the package of practical expedients to not reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases
 lease classification and initial direct costs as well as an accounting policy to account for lease and non-lease components as a single component.&#160; The Company also elected the optional transition method that gives companies the option to use the effective date as the date of initial application on transition
 and as a result
 the Company did not adjust its comparative period financial information or make the new required lease disclosures for periods before the effective date. The Company has elected to make the accounting policy election for short-term leases. Consequently
The Company&#8217;s leases relate to our corporate offices and warehouse. For leases with terms greater than 12 months
 the Company records the related asset and obligation at the present value of lease payments over the term. Lease renewal options are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use assets and right-of-use liabilities unless the Company is reasonably certain to exercise the optional renewal periods. The Company&#8217;s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.&#160; Additionally
The Company identified an error as of January 1
 2019 related to the adoption of ASC 842
 Leases
 which resulted in an overstatement of less than $0.1 million for right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities
 respectively.&#160;&#160; The Company also identified an overstatement of Accumulated Deficit of less than $0.1 million as of January 1
 2019.&#160; The errors related to the impact upon adoption of ASC 842 were corrected during the twelve months ended December 31
 2019.&#160; The Company believes the correction of these errors is not material to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the twelve months ended December 31
For leases entered into or reassessed after the adoption of the new standard
 the Company has elected the practical expedient allowed by the standard to account for all fixed consideration in a lease as a single lease component. Therefore
The Company&#8217;s leases do not provide a readily available implicit rate. Therefore
January 1
The table below presents certain information related to the lease costs for operating leases for the years ended December
Year ended December 31
As of December 31
 2019
 the weighted-average remaining operating lease term was 2.6 years and the incremental borrowing rate was 12.5% for operating leases recognized on our consolidated balance sheet. Short term lease costs
 excluding expenses relating to leases with a lease term of one month or less
 was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31
Rent expense for the year ended December 31
 2019 and 2018 was $0.5 million and $0.2 million

 participants are entitled to make pre-tax and/or Roth post-tax contributions up to the annual maximums established by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches 100% of up to 3% and 50% of up to 5% of participant contributions pursuant to the terms of the plan
 which contributions are limited to a percentage of the participant&#8217;s eligible compensation. The Company made contributions related to the plan and recognized expense of $0.1 million during the year ended December 31

Cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk. At December 31
 2019 and 2018
 all the Company&#8217;s cash and cash equivalents were deposited in accounts at several financial institutions. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with high-quality
 accredited financial institutions and
 accordingly
 such funds are subject to minimal credit risk. The Company may maintain balances with financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses historically in these accounts and believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk in its cash and cash equivalents.&#160; The Company has no significant off-balance sheet concentrations of credit risk
 such as foreign currency exchange contracts
 option contracts
 or other hedging arrangements.&#160;&#160; None of the Company&#8217;s customers had purchases that represented over 10% of total gross sales for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018.&#160; Accounts receivable from the largest customer represented 44% and 68% of accounts receivable at December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.







The entire disclosure for any concentrations existing at the date of the financial statements that make an entity vulnerable to a reasonably possible
 near-term
 severe impact. This disclosure informs financial statement users about the general nature of the risk associated with the concentration
 and may indicate the percentage of concentration risk as of the balance sheet date.

Tabular disclosure of warrants or rights issued. Warrants and rights outstanding are derivative securities that give the holder the right to purchase securities (usually equity) from the issuer at a specific price within a certain time frame. Warrants are often included in a new debt issue to entice investors by a higher return potential. The main difference between warrants and call options is that warrants are issued and guaranteed by the company
 whereas options are exchange instruments and are not issued by the company. Also
 the lifetime of a warrant is often measured in years
 while the lifetime of a typical option is measured in months. Disclose the title of issue of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the aggregate amount of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the date from which the warrants or rights are exercisable
 and the price at which the warrant or right is exercisable.
