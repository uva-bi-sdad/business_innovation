 including our principal executive officer who also serves as our principal financial officer
 we conducted an evaluation as of December 31
 2015
 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended. Based on this evaluation
 our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30







 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP
 and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition




 there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However
 these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore
 it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce
 though not eliminate
 this risk.&#160; In addition




 2016
 as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 our management conducted an assessment
 including testing
 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO Framework).&#160; A material weakness is a control deficiency
 or a combination of control deficiencies




 management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30
 2016.&#160; In arriving at that conclusion
 management identified as materials weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting: (1) the lack of accounting proficiency of our chief executive officer who is our sole officer and our principal accounting officer which has resulted in a reliance on part-time outside consultants to perform substantially all of our accounting functions


















 and (3) lack of control procedures that include multiple levels of review










 or is reasonably likely to materially affect





































 executive officers and key consultants as well as the principal offices and positions held by each person. We are managed by our Board of Directors. Currently
 the Board has two members. Our executive officers serve at the discretion of the Board of Directors. There are no family relationships between any of the directors and executive officers. In addition
