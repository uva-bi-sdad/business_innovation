ForeverGreen Worldwide Corporation
 formerly Whole Living
 Inc. (&#147;ForeverGreen Worldwide&#148;)
 was incorporated in the state of Nevada on March 18
 1999 as Whole Living
 Inc. &nbsp;In May of 1999
 Whole Living merged with Whole Living Inc.
 a Utah corporation
On January 13
 2006
 Whole Living acquired a 23% interest in ForeverGreen International
Whole Living
 Inc. changed the name of the corporation to &#147;ForeverGreen Worldwide Corporation&#148; on December 14
ForeverGreen Worldwide is a holding company that operates through its wholly owned subsidiary
 ForeverGreen International
 LLC (named alternately in this document as &#147;the Company&#148; or &#147;FGI&#148;). The Company develops
 manufactures and distributes an expansive line of all natural whole foods and related wellness and personal care products to North America
 Australia
 Europe
 Asia and South America
 including our new global offering
 
 a proprietary topical pain relief product that is listed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a Class I Medical Device. These patented topical adhesive strips are small
 light
 flat and inexpensive to ship in a greeting-card sized envelope
 making the product available to customers all around the world. Because of this unique product positioning and configuration
ForeverGreen specializes in the development
 manufacturing and marketing of a comprehensive line of raw/whole foods
The FGXpress and ForeverGreen lines currently operate separately with distinct enrollment structures and compensation plans. While protecting the unique marketing advantages of the two lines
While we relentlessly strive to improve our products
 processes and profitability
 what truly sets FGI apart is the value system that underlies every aspect of our operations. When ForeverGreen was founded in 2003

 Kindness
 Opportunity
 not a here-today
Kindness is more than a catch phrase at ForeverGreen. Kindness is at the core of how we treat everyone who comes in contact with our company. Although we constantly aim for harmony and excellence
 there are days when we disagree or make mistakes. When we discover a misalignment we deal with it directly
 but in a respectful way that leaves our working relationships intact. We embrace the same growth and profit motives as any successful company
The Company delivers products through a direct sales model known as network marketing or multilevel marketing. This form of direct selling provides entrepreneurial opportunities to individuals
 often with significantly lower barriers to entry (such as education
 technical experience and startup costs) than most other traditional small business ventures. Although the industry does not escape the controversies that arise in any business environment
 it is important to note that this model has delivered many of the world&#146;s most respected products and services for decades to a loyal and stable customer base. In keeping with our corporate philosophy
The lean and agile direct sales model offers unique business advantages not available to old-paradigm wholesale or consumer product companies. Because our products are sold through a global community of independent business owners
 ForeverGreen is not required to carry the overhead burden of a large direct-hire sales force or costly
According to Direct Selling Association (DSA) estimates
 U.S. direct retail sales increased by nearly 6% in 2012 from USD 29.87 billion to USD 31.63 billion. This increase accelerated a general upward trend that has been gaining momentum since 2009. The DSA estimates that by the end of 2012 nearly 16 million people were involved in direct selling in the United States. Although the industry technically experienced a small decline in participation over the past few years following a major surge after the 2008 financial crisis
Estimates by the World Federation of Direct Selling Associations (WFDSA) and other industry observers indicate that worldwide direct selling volume increased in 2012 by over 5% to nearly USD $16 billion. Globally the WFDSA estimates that 89.6 million people are active in direct selling and the Asia/Pacific region accounts for roughly half of this group
 paralleling the worldwide growth percentage. Other high growth regions include South America and Central and Eastern Europe and ForeverGreen is active in all of these areas
Member (independent member) base
By design
 ForeverGreen has remained strategically positioned in direct sales product categories that have seen consistent growth and deliver a higher share of sales revenue. Wellness and personal products continue to be among the most popular and profitable direct sales items. Growing public concern over food additives
 GMO products and the proliferation of food-related health problems suggests that demand for our products will remain strong for the foreseeable future. In addition
 person-to-person sales
 as practiced by ForeverGreen independent representatives
The market for products designed to enhance physical and mental performance is large and intensely competitive. Our primary competitors include other network marketing companies that manufacture and market herbal remedies
 nutritional products and personal care products. We also compete with large traditional retail businesses that offer products in similar categories. To attract positive industry attention and hold sustainable market advantage
 we emphasize differentiators such as our company culture
 our exclusive access to unique ingredients
 the quality and efficacy of our products and the reliability and convenience of our distribution system. We emphasize products that improve health through a diet of whole-food beverages and real
 natural products rather than fractionated pills and supplements. We take pride in our commitment to offering clean
 all natural
 product in the health beverage category. These competing products are based on a variety of fruit juices from around the world such as mangosteen
 noni
 acai and other fruit or plant ingredients. To our knowledge

 rose
 ginger
 aloe vera
 frankincense
 and other quality ingredients in a delicious base of cranberry
 blueberry
A number of our Smart Food products compete with &#147;health bars&#148; and nutritional supplements offered by many competitor companies as meal replacement products. Our essential oils and personal care products compete with companies that offer similar products
 such as NuSkin
 Neways and Young Living Essential Oils. In addition
 herbal remedies
 personal care
 and nutritional products can be purchased in a wide variety of channels of distribution. While we believe that consumers appreciate the convenience of ordering products from home through a sales person they know and trust or through a catalog
We also compete for Members (distributors) with other direct selling organizations
 many of which have a longer operating history and higher visibility
 name recognition
 and financial resources. Some of the dominant network marketing companies in our existing markets are Amway Corporation
 Herbalife and NuSkin Enterprises
 to name a few. We also compete with many smaller network marketing companies that also offer personal care products
 health and nutrition products. We compete for new Members on the strength of our product line

 philosophy we call RESTORATION90. RESTORATION90 is based on the simple concept that the body doesn&#146;t know its chronological age
 but only acts its biological age. We are convinced that the body can work miracles and restore itself to a more youthful biological age when it is given the proper raw materials. FGI specializes in providing these high quality raw materials through a comprehensive line of innovative products. In November 2012
FGI remains committed to providing innovative

 one of the first benefits customers notice is a relief of pain. For this reason
Our 100% customer satisfaction policy allows product returns for all our products that are resalable
 subject to a restocking fee. This policy improves our customer and Member satisfaction and brings us in line with Direct Selling Association recommendations. Actual product returns have been less than 2% of sales for the past two fiscal years and was 1.3% in 2013. We also maintain an insurance policy for product liability claims of $1
000
000 USD per claim and $2

We provide exclusive
 innovative nutritional and whole-food products that are eaten or consumed to achieve healthy results within the body. While the nutritional supplement industry
 consisting of individually standardized supplements
 herbs and the like has been flat in recent years
 ForeverGreen&#146;s exclusive and proprietary products protected through trade secrets and our proprietary processes and ingredients have experienced significant growth. In addition
We offer our products online and each Member Kit purchased also includes a virtual online website
 known as a Virtual Office
 designed for Members
 where they can manage
 monitor
 and operate their businesses 24 hours a day from any location with internet access. This site is password protected
 exclusive to Members and provides access to Company news
 product tracking
 product information
 and a library of Company documents geared to help them with their business
In addition
 we offer a replicated website model to our Members allowing them to obtain an immediate online presence and personal URL for their business
 which they can use as a place to direct potential new Members to learn about the Company and sign up as Members. Features on this website include Company information
 video and flash presentations
 prospect management and follow-up
 online registration of new Members
 online product ordering
We rely on a network marketing system for the distribution of our products through our independent business owners (referred to as Members by ForeverGreen) and customers. Our revenue depends directly upon the sales efforts of our Members around the world. We distribute our products exclusively through independent Members who have contracted directly with us. Members are entitled to purchase products from us for personal use or for resale
 depending on their market
 and the sales by our Members have the potential to earn the Member commissions. Individuals who join as Members may enroll and sponsor other Members
 and may further earn commissions from the resale of products. Our Compensation Plans for FGXpress and ForeverGreen provide many different ways to earn income for our Members
 from FastStart earnings
 to personal rebates on Member purchases
Our main distribution center is located in Pleasant Grove
 Utah near the main corporate office. We also have a fulfillment center in Auckland
 New Zealand that improves our product delivery with cost savings and efficiencies for our Australian and New Zealand markets. In addition
 we have ForeverGreen offices in Costa Rica
 Colombia and Chile
 Singapore
 Japan and Mexico
 but are using a third party in the Netherlands to service our Members in the European Union
 and a third-party provider to distribute our products throughout Mexico. We buy raw materials from third-party suppliers
 manufacture our whole-food products in-house and warehouse the bulk food product at our facilities. We service individual product orders and ship to individual customers and Members in the United States
Members and their customers pay for products prior to shipment
 incurring minimal accounts receivable for us. Members and customers have access to place orders online through their ForeverGreen websites
 by phone through a growing call center
 or even by facsimile. Typically
Enrollment and sponsorship activities are encouraged
 but not required of our Members. Successful Members will both enroll and sponsor new Members. The sponsoring of new Members creates multiple levels in a network marketing structure. Individuals that a Member sponsors are referred to as &#147;downline
&#148; or &#147;sponsored&#148; Members. If downline Members also sponsor new Members
 they create additional levels in the structure
Members assist their downline Members to successfully do the same. While we provide product and Company brochures
 magazines
 websites
 DVDs and other sales and marketing materials
 our greatest success and retention comes from Members who are accountable and responsible for educating and training new Members with respect to our products
 the Company&#146;s FGXpress and ForeverGreen Compensation Plans
Generally
 Members who are new to network marketing invite friends
 family members
 and acquaintances to attend conference calls
 review websites and marketing materials
Turnover is a typical aspect of the direct selling or network marketing industry. Our Members understand that to prevent a possible decline in their organization and sales volume
 the enrollment
 sponsoring and training of new Members is necessary to increase the overall Member force and motivate new and existing Members. We may experience seasonal decreases in Member sponsoring and product sales because of holidays and customary vacation periods. We cannot predict the timing or degree of these enrollment fluctuations because of the number of factors that impact the sponsoring of new Members. We cannot assure that the number
Weekly conference calls

A potential Member must enter into a standard Member Agreement which governs the relationship between The Company and the Member in accord with our policies and procedures. Any person may join The Company as a Member to purchase products for personal use or to build a downline sales organization. In order to become a Member
 a person may purchase a non-commissionable online digital Member Kit which includes all the business building websites
 multi-language web office and online library. No product purchases are required to become a Member
 and large inventory product purchases are discouraged. However
 in order to receive compensation as a Member
Our Member Agreement and Policies and Procedures
 which outline the scope of permissible marketing activities
 and information on the ForeverGreen compensation plan are posted on our website. Our Member rules and guidelines are designed to provide Members with maximum flexibility and opportunity within the bounds of governmental regulations regarding product claims
 network marketing and prudent business policies and procedures. Members are independent contractors and are thus prohibited from representing themselves as our agents or as employees of the company. Members are obligated to present our products and business opportunity ethically and professionally. Members contractually agree to abide by all local
 state and federal laws and regulations pertaining to the advertising
 sale and distribution of our products. All advertising must be factual and not misleading and a Member may be terminated for making false claims about the income potential
 the compensation plan
Members must represent to potential Members that the receipt of commissions is based on sales volumes and substantial efforts. Products may be promoted by personal contact or by literature produced or approved by the company. In traditional retail environments
 our products generally may not be sold
We are not in a position to provide the same level of direction
 motivation
 and oversight to our Members as we would our own employees because the Members are independent contractors residing across the United States and in many other countries. We review alleged reports of Member misconduct or breach of contract to enforce contract compliance. &nbsp;If we determine that a Member has violated any of the Member Policies or Procedures
 we may elect to educate the Member regarding the contract terms or impose sanctions such as warnings
 probation
 suspension of privileges of Membership
 withholding commissions until specified conditions are satisfied
 launched in November 2012
 we also introduced a companion compensation plan our Peoples Plan to support this business and reward people who purchase and build their FGXpress business. An FGXpress Member could begin their commissions earning by introducing people to their FGXpress business. &nbsp;When their personally invited person makes the first purchase
 the Member can earn a one-time 25% Fast Start Bonus. &nbsp;We wanted to make sure everyone knew what to do to achieve success in this business
 therefore we introduced the X-Tribe concept. &nbsp;X-Tribe is an easy road map to success in the FGXpress business. Each person begins building their X-Tribe by enrolling 4 people into their business. &nbsp;They then teach each person to do the same. &nbsp;When a person has 4 personally enrolled members and with 1000 points in their X-Tribe group
FGXpress also promotes team building. When people work as a team
 they can be rewarded for their team actions. The Company pays 8% or 12% of their small leg organization&#146;s purchases weekly. On top of the Team Bonus
 leaders also can receive rewards from helping and leading their team. The Company pays a Matching Bonus up to 100% and 4 levels to leaders who achieve various ranks. We also offer lucrative one-time cash bonuses to people who reach new ranks for the first time. These cash bonuses range from $500 to $25
ForeverGreen&#146;s People&#146;s Plan is very simple to learn
 which in turn means it is simple to teach and duplicate with our current Members and new Members. Part of the simplicity of the new People&#146;s Plan is it incorporates the People&#146;s Pack. The purchase of this pack by our Members allows each Member to maximize earnings via retail market up
Each company product carries a specified number of commissionable volume
 or &#147;points.&#148; Commissions or bonuses are based on a Member&#146;s personal qualification
 organizational
 and leg commission volumes. A Member receives commissions based on a percentage of the sales volume of their downline weekly and monthly. Commission qualification volume points are essentially based upon a percentage of the product&#146;s wholesale cost
 net of any point-of-sale taxes. As a Member&#146;s retail business expands
 and as they successfully sponsor other Members into the business
 both of which expand their businesses
 with a product categorized as A
 B or C
 or other value package product combinations. This provides incentive to discuss successful products and programs with others. As a Member assists other individuals join the Member&#146;s organization
A Member can earn retail profits for the difference between sales price and the wholesale price of the product. A Member can earn a 20% Fast Start Bonus on a new enrollee&#146;s first purchase. This feature works with the current month end and can earn 5%
Our Members progress though the &#147;People&#146;s Plan&#148; compensation plan with recognition and ranks that show their standing and leadership within the Company. A Member must generate Personal Volume (PV) with individual purchases or customer purchases. &nbsp;A Member&#146;s rank may vary from month to month based upon the increase and decrease in their monthly sales volume. &nbsp;The new weekly &#147;Fast Start Bonus&#148; feature allows for even the lowest member status
 requiring minimal volume qualifications
 to earn compensation as they grow their businesses on a weekly basis. &nbsp;The rank of Apprentice is indicative of the status of the new Member&#146;s first rank in the ForeverGreen business
 which is achieved by creating a total of 100 points of Personal Enrolled Member Volume (PEMV) and 50 points PV. PEMV is volume points purchased by those member personal introduced on the Members first level. &nbsp;&nbsp;The progressive ranks include: &nbsp;Apprentice
 Learning
 Determined
 Successful
 Leader
 Team Leader
 MVP
 Hall of Fame
 Free and Rainmaker. &nbsp;&nbsp;Each rank qualifies for varying percentages paid monthly upon volume purchases per downline generations. &nbsp;The rank of MVP also earns a 2% pool shares with all MVP&#146;s. &nbsp;The ranks of Hall of Fame
There are many competitor companies that offer unilevel plans
 FastStart bonuses
 and leadership pools. However
we believe that our approach and percentage of commission payout
 combined with our unique and specific product focus and Company culture and growth
 presents a far superior opportunity that that offered by competitor plans. This represents a unique
 competitive advantage for our Members. The personal rewards for our Members generate incentive to attract additional network marketing professionals and newcomers alike. As our Members are rewarded financially
 they are motivated to continue developing an organization to help others receive financial and recognition rewards and
 as a result
 the Company continues to grow. We continue to look at ways to improve our compensation plan in the future
The FGXpress Hybrid Compensation Plan brings together the best of unilevel and binary compensation plans. Making an important contribution to the network marketing profession
 FGXpress has introduced the breakthrough X-Tribe concept. This plan is so simple that it can be explained on a napkin. &nbsp;Each Personally Enrolled Member is part of two trees. The ENROLLMENT TREE addresses the unilevel features of the plan
 with no limit to how many Members can be enrolled per level. The PLACEMENT TREE addresses the binary features of the plan. Each Member can only have two organizational legs
The FGXpress compensation plan provides weekly payout. To be eligible to participate in the plan
 receive bonuses
 earn rank advancements and to keep your carry-over from week to week
 it is necessary to have an &#147;active order&#148; for 100 QV (qualifying volume) or at least 50 QV at all times. With every product purchase
 this volume (QV) is &#147;active&#148; for the current weekly pay period plus three more (four weekly periods total). Without an active order
 weekly pay period
As with any business
 individual results may vary
 and will be based on the Member&#146;s personal capacity
 business experience
 expertise and level of desire. There are no guarantees concerning the level of success FGXpress Members may experience. The examples used in FGI training materials are exceptional results
 which may not apply to an average Member
There are several ways for Members to get paid under the FGXpress compensation plan. The X-Tribe Bonus rewards duplication. The Team Bonus rewards Members for helping the leg that needs it most through training
 mentoring and various forms of business support. The FastStart Bonus rewards enrollment activity with a 25% payout on the product orders of Personally Enrolled Members (PEM) during their first 4 weeks in the business. There is no limit to how many PEMs Members can enroll. The Rank Advancement Bonus rewards leadership development as a leader. Achieve a new rank once and get the title. Achieve it twice and get the bonus. The Matching Bonus rewards activity that supports the business growth of Personally Enrolled Members. This floating bonus provides a total payout of 62% from regular orders
Trademarks
We have secured
 or are in the process of securing
 trademark protection in the United States and around the world in markets where we currently do business or where we have a future strategic interest. &nbsp;As of December 31
 2013 the Company holds eight U.S. trademarks and no foreign trademarks. &nbsp;As we continue to expand internationally
A number of our products utilize proprietary formulations and processes. Although ForeverGreen does not directly hold any patents at this time

Throughout 2013
 we had the freedom to use any supplier to purchase raw materials. We used several different vendor sources since most of the raw materials were readily available in the marketplace. We maintain good relationships with our key vendors to ensure a continuous supply of our key products. During 2013

Direct selling activities are regulated by various federal
 state and local governmental agencies in the United States and foreign countries. To our knowledge
the laws and regulations relating to not-for-resale and direct selling activities in the United States
 Mexico
 Japan
 Canada
 Singapore
 New Zealand
 Australia
 Germany
 the Netherlands
 &nbsp;the United Kingdom
 and other markets. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes
 often referred to as &#147;pyramids
&#148; &#147;money games
&#148; &#147;business opportunity&#148; or &#147;chain sales&#148; schemes that promise quick rewards for little or no effort
 require high entry costs
 use high pressure recruiting methods
 and/or do not involve legitimate products. The laws and regulations in our current markets often impose certain cancellation/product return
 inventory buy-backs and &#147;cooling-off&#148; rights for consumers and Members
The purpose of these laws and regulations is to ensure that Members are being compensated for sales of products and not for recruitment of new Members. The extent and provisions of these laws vary from state to state and internationally. International laws may impose significant restrictions and limitations on our business operations. For example
 in foreign countries where we have not yet established a local office
 our Members and customers purchase product through a not-for-resale program enabling them to receive product for personal consumption
Any assertion or determination that we are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We cannot assure that regulatory authorities in our existing markets will not impose new legislation or change existing legislation that might adversely affect our business in those markets. Also
 we cannot assure that new judicial interpretations of existing law will not be issued that adversely affect our business. Regulatory action
 whether or not it results in a final determination adverse to us
 has the potential to create negative publicity
 with detrimental effects on the motivation and recruitment of our Members and
 consequently
Our products and related marketing and advertising are subject to governmental regulation by various domestic agencies and authorities
 including the Food and Drug Administration
 which regulates food
 medical products and cosmetics. The advertising and marketing of our products are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission
 which enforces consumer protection laws in regard to truth in advertising. The Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the public from unreasonable risk of injuries and death associated with consumer products
 and the United States Department of Agriculture regulates food safety and quality. Similar types of agencies exist in our foreign markets. To date
Our markets have regulations concerning product formulation
 labeling and packaging. These laws and regulations often require us to
 among other things
 conform product labeling to the language and regulations
 and register or qualify products with the applicable government authority or obtain necessary approvals or file necessary notifications for the marketing of such products. Many of our existing markets also regulate product claims and advertising. These laws regulate the types of claims and representations that can be made regarding the capabilities of products. For example
 in the United States we are unable to make any claim that our nutritional products will diagnose

You should carefully review and consider the risks described below
 as well as the other information in this report and in other reports and documents we file with the SEC when evaluating our business and future prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties
 not presently known to us
 or that we currently see as immaterial
 may also occur. &nbsp;If any of the following risks or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occurs
 then our business
 financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. In that event
 Our revenues from sales may not be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and/or to implement our business strategies. We may be required to rely on debt financing
 further loans from related parties
 Our inability to raise additional capital or to obtain additional financing
 if needed
 would negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategies and meet our goals. This

Revenues and costs of revenues are recognized during the period in which the products are provided. The Company applies the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) 605-10
 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements ASC 605-10
 which provides guidance on the recognition
 presentation
 and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the SEC. ASC 605-10 outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies. In general
 the Company recognizes revenue for sale of products when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 (ii) delivery has occurred
 (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable
The Company&#146;s sources of revenue are from the sale of various food and other natural product sales and royalties earned. The Company recognizes the sale upon shipment of such goods. The Company offers a 100% satisfaction guarantee against defects for 30 days after the sale of their product except for a few circumstances. The Company extends this return policy to its members for a 30 day period and the consumer has the same return policy in effect against the member. Returns are less than 2.5% of sales for both years presented. Revenues are reported net of returns. All conditions of ASC 605-10 are met and the revenue is recorded upon sale
Accounts receivable arise from doing business with third party distributor centers in various locations throughout South America and Korea. The accounts receivable are made up of fees and royalties owed by the distribution centers to the Company for the right to do business in our name. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts when it is determined that collection amounts owed is unlikely. In 2013 the Company recorded a $29
234 allowance for receivables in some of our foreign markets. No allowance had been recorded at December 31
 2012
Members are required to pay for products prior to shipment. Members typically pay for products by credit cards
 wire transfer
 e-wallet accounts
 other payment cards
 and cash. Accordingly
The consolidated balance sheets and statement of operations for the periods ended December 31
The computation of earnings per share of common stock is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding at the date of the financial statements. Basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Our potentially dilutive shares
 which include convertible debentures
 have not been included in the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for all periods presented
 as the results would be anti-dilutive. Such potentially dilutive shares are excluded when the effect would be to reduce net loss per share. There were 0 and 15
411 such potentially dilutive shares excluded as of December 31
 2013 and 2012
 and 1

975 and 0 were included as of December 31

December 31
The Company provides for income taxes under ASC 740
Expenditures for property and equipment and for renewals and betterments
 which extend the originally estimated economic life of assets or convert the assets to a new use
 are capitalized at cost. Expenditures for maintenance
 repairs and other renewals of items are charged to expense. When items are disposed of
 the cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciable asset lives range from 3 to 7 years with leasehold improvements being depreciated over the lesser of the term of the lease or the life of the improvements. Depreciation expense for the period ended December 31
 2013 and 2012 is $62
325 and $66
005
In accordance with ASC 360-10
 the Company records impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount. &nbsp;The Company determined no impairment adjustment was needed based on the analysis for the years ended December 31
Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market and valued on a first-in
 first-out basis. Inventory consists primarily of consumable food products and ingredients. Food products are discarded as they reach the expiration dates
 because the food products are made with natural foods containing a minimum of preservatives. Non-food products are reviewed periodically to determine any obsolescence and a reserve is booked when appropriate. The products have expiration dates that range from 3 months on some of the food products to 2 years for non-food products. On December 31
 2013 and 2012 there was an allowance for obsolete inventory in the amount of $5
660 and $45
660
The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for the cash and cash equivalents
 receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The carrying value of convertible notes payable approximates fair value because negotiated terms and conditions are consistent with current market rates as of December 31
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. In these financial statements
 assets
December 31
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risks consist of cash and cash equivalents. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents at well-known
 quality financial institutions. At times
 such cash and investments may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. The accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250
The Company has an agreement with one vendor that supplies 100% of a significant ingredient that is included in several top selling products. It could decrease sales significantly if that vendor were to discontinue the supply of this ingredient. There are other providers of that ingredient in the world
 however
 the Company considers this provider to have the very best quality
 which is nutritionally superior to other sources of this ingredient
The Company's accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the ASC 505-50. The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendor's performance is complete. In the case of equity instruments issued to consultants
Intangible assets consist of patent costs
 trademark costs and the customer base. Patent costs are costs incurred to develop and file patent applications. Trademark costs are costs incurred to develop and file trademark applications. If the patents or trademarks are approved
 the costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of 7 years for patents and 10 years for trademarks. Unsuccessful patent and trademark application costs are expensed at the time the application is denied. Management assesses the carrying values of long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances warrant such a review. In performing this assessment
 management considers current market analysis of the technology and future cash flows. The Company recognizes impairment losses when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated from long-lived assets are less than the net carrying amount of intangible assets. No impairment was recognized accordingly
 during the years ended December 31
The Company recognizes revenues upon the shipment of product. As of December 31
 2013
 the Company had $405
841 of sales which were not shipped as of the period end and as such recorded deferred revenue of $405
841 compared to $113
085 for December 31
The Company&#146;s functional currency is recorded in various currencies
 corresponding to the various foreign subsidiaries and its reporting currency is the United States dollar. Management has adopted ASC 830-20
 &#147;Foreign Currency Matters &#150; Foreign Currency Transactions&#148;. All assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. For revenues and expenses

In September 2011
 the FASB clarified ASC 350-20 to amend and simplify tests for goodwill impairment by permitting an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a two-step goodwill impairment test. The amendments in ASC 350-20 are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method and is recognized over the estimated lives of the property and equipment. Depreciation expense was $62

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 management has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. &nbsp;The disclosure controls and procedures ensure that all information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rule and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. &nbsp;Based on that evaluation
 management concluded that
 as of December 31
 2013
 these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. &nbsp;In May 2013 the Company determined that we needed to restate our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31
 2012 because we had understated revenue for the fiscal year 2012. &nbsp;In July 2013 we filed an amended Form 10-K for the year ended December 31
maintenance of records in reasonable detail to accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of &nbsp;assets
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with &nbsp;generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations
 including the possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly
 even an effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also
For the year ended December 31
 2013
 our management has relied on the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)
 &#147;Internal Control - Integrated Framework
&#148; to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and based upon that framework management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective at that reasonable assurance level for the period covered by this report. &nbsp;During the first quarter of 2013 our management determined that changes were necessary to the implementation of our internal controls over financial reporting. &nbsp;Specific areas of ineffectiveness occurred during the fourth quarter of 2012
In response to this evaluation
Our Chief Financial Officer has determined that there were no changes made in the implementation of our internal controls over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31

 presentation
 and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the SEC. ASC 605-10 outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies. In general
 the Company recognizes revenue for sale of products when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 (ii) delivery has occurred
 (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable
The Company&#39;s sources of revenue are from the sale of various food and other natural product sales and royalties earned. The Company recognizes the sale upon shipment of such goods. The Company offers a 100% satisfaction guarantee against defects for 30 days after the sale of their product except for a few circumstances. The Company extends this return policy to its members for a 30 day period and the consumer has the same return policy in effect against the member. Returns are less than 2.5% of sales for both years presented. Revenues are reported net of returns. All conditions of ASC 605-10 are met and the revenue is recorded upon sale
Accounts receivable arise from doing business with third party distributor centers in various locations throughout South America and Korea. The accounts receivable are made up of fees and royalties owed by the distribution centers to the Company for the right to do business in our name. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts when it is determined that collection amounts owed is unlikely. In 2013 the Company recorded a $29
234 allowance for receivables in some of our foreign markets. No allowance had been recorded at December 31
 2012
Members are required to pay for products prior to shipment. Members typically pay for products by credit cards
 wire transfer
 e-wallet accounts
 other payment cards
 and cash. Accordingly
The consolidated balance sheets and statement of operations for the periods ended December 31
The computation of earnings per share of common stock is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding at the date of the financial statements. Basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Our potentially dilutive shares
 which include convertible debentures
 have not been included in the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for all periods presented
 as the results would be anti-dilutive. Such potentially dilutive shares are excluded when the effect would be to reduce net loss per share. There were 0 and 15
411 such potentially dilutive shares excluded as of December 31
 2013 and 2012
 and 1
099
975 and 0 were included as of December 31
 2013 and 2012
The Company provides for income taxes under ASC 740
Expenditures for property and equipment and for renewals and betterments
 which extend the originally estimated economic life of assets or convert the assets to a new use
 are capitalized at cost. Expenditures for maintenance
 repairs and other renewals of items are charged to expense. When items are disposed of
 the cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciable asset lives range from 3 to 7 years with leasehold improvements being depreciated over the lesser of the term of the lease or the life of the improvements. Depreciation expense for the period ended December 31
 2013 and 2012 is $62
325 and $66
005
In accordance with ASC 360-10
 the Company records impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount. &nbsp;The Company determined no impairment adjustment was needed based on the analysis for the years ended December 31
Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market and valued on a first-in
 first-out basis. Inventory consists primarily of consumable food products and ingredients. Food products are discarded as they reach the expiration dates
 because the food products are made with natural foods containing a minimum of preservatives. Non-food products are reviewed periodically to determine any obsolescence and a reserve is booked when appropriate. The products have expiration dates that range from 3 months on some of the food products to 2 years for non-food products. On December 31
 2013 and 2012 there was an allowance for obsolete inventory in the amount of $5
660 and $45
660
The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for the cash and cash equivalents
 receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The carrying value of convertible notes payable approximates fair value because negotiated terms and conditions are consistent with current market rates as of December 31
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. In these financial statements
 assets
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risks consist of cash and cash equivalents. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents at well-known
 quality financial institutions. At times
 such cash and investments may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. The accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250
The Company has an agreement with one vendor that supplies 100% of a significant ingredient that is included in several top selling products. It could decrease sales significantly if that vendor were to discontinue the supply of this ingredient. There are other providers of that ingredient in the world
 however
 the Company considers this provider to have the very best quality
 which is nutritionally superior to other sources of this ingredient
The Company&#39;s accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the ASC 505-50. The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendor&#39;s performance is complete. In the case of equity instruments issued to consultants
Intangible assets consist of patent costs
 trademark costs and the customer base. Patent costs are costs incurred to develop and file patent applications. Trademark costs are costs incurred to develop and file trademark applications. If the patents or trademarks are approved
 the costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of 7 years for patents and 10 years for trademarks. Unsuccessful patent and trademark application costs are expensed at the time the application is denied. Management assesses the carrying values of long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances warrant such a review. In performing this assessment
 management considers current market analysis of the technology and future cash flows. The Company recognizes impairment losses when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated from long-lived assets are less than the net carrying amount of intangible assets. No impairment was recognized accordingly
 during the years ended December 31
The Company recognizes revenues upon the shipment of product. As of December 31
 2013
 the Company had $405
841 of sales which were not shipped as of the period end and as such recorded deferred revenue of $405
841 compared to $113
085 for December 31
The Company&#39;s functional currency is recorded in various currencies
 corresponding to the various foreign subsidiaries and its reporting currency is the United States dollar. Management has adopted ASC 830-20
 Foreign Currency Matters - Foreign Currency Transactions. All assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. For revenues and expenses
In September 2011
 the FASB clarified ASC 350-20 to amend and simplify tests for goodwill impairment by permitting an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a two-step goodwill impairment test. The amendments in ASC 350-20 are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed
 and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

 and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent. The amount of the economic entity's stockholders' equity attributable to the parent excludes the amount of stockholders' equity which is allocable to that ownership interest in subsidiary equity which is not attributable to the parent (noncontrolling interest
 minority interest). This excludes temporary equity and is sometimes called permanent equity.

Revenues and costs of revenues are recognized during the period in which the products are provided. The Company applies the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605-10
 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements ASC 605-10
 which provides guidance on the recognition
 presentation
 and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the SEC. ASC 605-10 outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies. In general
 the Company recognizes revenue for sale of products when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 (ii) delivery has occurred
 (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable
The Company&#39;s sources of revenue are from the sale of various food and other natural product sales and royalties earned. The Company recognizes the sale upon shipment of such goods. The Company offers a 100% satisfaction guarantee against defects for 30 days after the sale of their product except for a few circumstances. The Company extends this return policy to its members for a 30 day period and the consumer has the same return policy in effect against the member. Returns are less than 2.5% of sales for both years presented. Revenues are reported net of returns. All conditions of ASC 605-10 are met and the revenue is recorded upon sale
 with an estimated allowance for returns where material.


        
Accounts receivable arise from doing business with third party distributor centers in various locations throughout South America and Korea. The accounts receivable are made up of fees and royalties owed by the distribution centers to the Company for the right to do business in our name. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts when it is determined that collection amounts owed is unlikely. In 2013 the Company recorded a $29
234 allowance for receivables in some of our foreign markets. No allowance had been recorded at December 31
 2012
Members are required to pay for products prior to shipment. Members typically pay for products by credit cards
 wire transfer
 e-wallet accounts
 other payment cards
 and cash. Accordingly
 the Company seldom carries accounts receivable from members that are not distribution centers and any balances carried would be minimal.


        
The consolidated balance sheets and statement of operations for the periods ended December 31
 2013 and 2012 include the books of ForeverGreen Worldwide Corporation (Nevada) and it&#39;s wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidation.


        
The computation of earnings per share of common stock is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding at the date of the financial statements. Basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Our potentially dilutive shares
 which include convertible debentures
 have not been included in the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for all periods presented
 as the results would be anti-dilutive. Such potentially dilutive shares are excluded when the effect would be to reduce net loss per share. There were 0 and 15
411 such potentially dilutive shares excluded as of December 31
 2013 and 2012
 and 1

 respectively.


        
The Company provides for income taxes under ASC 740
 Accounting for Income Taxes. ASC 740 requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. The Company&#39;s predecessor operated as entity exempt from Federal and State income taxes.


        
        


        
Expenditures for property and equipment and for renewals and betterments
 which extend the originally estimated economic life of assets or convert the assets to a new use
 are capitalized at cost. Expenditures for maintenance
 repairs and other renewals of items are charged to expense. When items are disposed of
 the cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciable asset lives range from 3 to 7 years with leasehold improvements being depreciated over the lesser of the term of the lease or the life of the improvements. Depreciation expense for the period ended December 31
 2013 and 2012 is $62
325 and $66
005
 respectively.


        
In accordance with ASC 360-10
 the Company records impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount. &nbsp;The Company determined no impairment adjustment was needed based on the analysis for the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012.


        
Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market and valued on a first-in
 first-out basis. Inventory consists primarily of consumable food products and ingredients. Food products are discarded as they reach the expiration dates
 because the food products are made with natural foods containing a minimum of preservatives. Non-food products are reviewed periodically to determine any obsolescence and a reserve is booked when appropriate. The products have expiration dates that range from 3 months on some of the food products to 2 years for non-food products. On December 31
 2013 and 2012 there was an allowance for obsolete inventory in the amount of $5
660 and $45
660
 respectively.


        
The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for the cash and cash equivalents
 receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The carrying value of convertible notes payable approximates fair value because negotiated terms and conditions are consistent with current market rates as of December 31
 2013 and 2012.


        
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. In these financial statements
 assets
 liabilities and earnings involve extensive reliance on management&#39;s estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


        
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risks consist of cash and cash equivalents. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents at well-known
 quality financial institutions. At times
 such cash and investments may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. The accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250
The Company has an agreement with one vendor that supplies 100% of a significant ingredient that is included in several top selling products. It could decrease sales significantly if that vendor were to discontinue the supply of this ingredient. There are other providers of that ingredient in the world
 however
 the Company considers this provider to have the very best quality
 which is nutritionally superior to other sources of this ingredient
 and has no intention of obtaining it from any other provider.


        
The Company&#39;s accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the ASC 505-50. The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendor&#39;s performance is complete. In the case of equity instruments issued to consultants
 the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement.


        
Intangible assets consist of patent costs
 trademark costs and the customer base. Patent costs are costs incurred to develop and file patent applications. Trademark costs are costs incurred to develop and file trademark applications. If the patents or trademarks are approved
 the costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of 7 years for patents and 10 years for trademarks. Unsuccessful patent and trademark application costs are expensed at the time the application is denied. Management assesses the carrying values of long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances warrant such a review. In performing this assessment
 management considers current market analysis of the technology and future cash flows. The Company recognizes impairment losses when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated from long-lived assets are less than the net carrying amount of intangible assets. No impairment was recognized accordingly
 during the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012.


        
The Company recognizes revenues upon the shipment of product. As of December 31
 2013
 the Company had $405
841 of sales which were not shipped as of the period end and as such recorded deferred revenue of $405
841 compared to $113
085 for December 31
 2012.


        
The Company&#39;s functional currency is recorded in various currencies
 corresponding to the various foreign subsidiaries and its reporting currency is the United States dollar. Management has adopted ASC 830-20
 Foreign Currency Matters - Foreign Currency Transactions. All assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. For revenues and expenses
 the weighted average exchange rate for the period is used.&nbsp; Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in other comprehensive loss.


        
In September 2011
 the FASB clarified ASC 350-20 to amend and simplify tests for goodwill impairment by permitting an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a two-step goodwill impairment test. The amendments in ASC 350-20 are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed
 and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

The Company accounts for its investments in its subsidiaries using the equity method of accounting. &nbsp;The excess of the consideration paid for subsidiaries over the fair value of acquired tangible assets less the fair value of acquired liabilities is assigned to intangible assets and goodwill. &nbsp;On January 15
 2006 the Company purchased a 23% share of ForeverGreen International LLC
 by issuing 1
266
667 post-split shares of common stock at $1.80 per share for a value of $2

 2007 the Company purchased the remaining 77% of ForeverGreen International LLC
 by issuing 5

The Customer base intangible was calculated using a percentage of the gross margin of ForeverGreen International LLC. &nbsp;The Company is amortizing the customer base over a period of ten years. &nbsp;The 23% ownership in ForeverGreen International LLC
 for the year resulted in an entry to other expense in the amount of $53
933. &nbsp;The Company obtained an independent third party valuation to ascertain the amount to allocate to identifiable intangible assets
 and the useful lives of those assets. &nbsp;The useful life of an intangible asset that is being amortized is evaluated each reporting period as to whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. In accordance with ASC 360-10-35
 intangible assets tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever circumstances indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit may be less than the carrying amount of the intangible asset. See Note 1 (o) above for gross book value
 accumulated amortization and net book value of the customer base intangible asset. No impairment was recorded as of December 31

The Company purchased two significant products from two separate independent suppliers during the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012. &nbsp;These materials are significant in several of our top selling products. &nbsp;&nbsp;If our vendors were to discontinue supplying those materials
 it could decrease sales significantly. &nbsp;The Company recognizes there are other providers
 but consider these suppliers to have the very best quality. &nbsp;
