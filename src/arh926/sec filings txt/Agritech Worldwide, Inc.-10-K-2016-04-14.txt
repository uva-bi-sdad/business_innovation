 Inc. (formerly Z Trim Holdings
 Inc.) is an agritech company that owns existing
 and seeks to develop new
 products and processes that convert generally available agricultural by-products into multi-functional all-natural ingredients that can be used in food manufacturing and other industries. Our primary focus and the source of substantially all of our revenue is from the sale of our all-natural products
 Z Trim&#174;
 to the food industry. We currently sell a line of all-natural products to the food industry designed to help manufacturers reduce their costs
 improve the quality of finished goods
 and solve many production problems.&#160; Our innovative technology can provide value-added all-natural ingredients across virtually all food industry categories.&#160; These products offer a range of functional attributes
 including helping to reduce fat and calories
 adding fiber
 improving shelf-stability
 preventing oil migration
 and enhancing binding capacity &#8211; all without degrading the taste and texture of the final food products.&#160; Perhaps most significantly
 our&#160; ingredients can help extend the life of finished products




 while maintaining the essential taste and mouth-feel associated with full-fat products.&#160; The potential global market for our line of products spans the entire food and nutritional beverage industry
 including fat-free
 low-fat
 reduced-fat and full-fat
 across meats
 baked goods
 dairy and non-dairy products
 snacks
 beverages
 dressings




 we opened an industrial products division focusing on the manufacture
 marketing and sales of products designed specifically for industrial applications
 including oil drilling fluids
 petroleum coke
 charcoal briquettes
 hydraulic fracturing
 and paper and wood adhesives.&#160; When used in industrial operations
 we believe that our&#160; products can reduce costs
 enhance supply-chain reliability
 limit environmental impact
 and improve finished product quality compared to current products such as guar gum
 xanthan gum
 CMC
 lignosulfonates and starches used as binders
 adhesives
 viscofiers or emulsifiers. In January 2013
 we entered into a joint development agreement with Newpark Drilling Fluids LLC
 a subsidiary of Newpark Resources
 Inc.
 to develop new







 including moisture management
 oil deflection
 texture and appearance quality
 fat and calorie reduction. Perhaps most significantly
 these attributes allow manufacturers using our products to reduce costs of finished products by replacing more expensive ingredients with our fiber and water.&#160; Z Trim&#174; is now being used by food manufacturers world-wide
 across a multitude of food categories
 such as meats
 sauces
 soups
 dressings
 baked goods
 fillings
 toppings
 prepared meals
 dairy products
 frozen handheld snacks
 and pizza dough. Food formulators are seeking greater functionality and product performance than they can get from starches
 gums
 fats
 and other fibers &#8211; for both standard and lower fat content foods - and are increasingly discovering how Z Trim&#174; multifunctional ingredients can help to satisfy their consumers with finished products that we believe have enhanced eating quality
 outstanding product performance
 and frequently




 increasing obesity trends
 the economy
 rising costs and hectic lifestyles have triggered an evolution of the food industry and consumer expectations.&#160; Our goal is to further enable food manufacturers to address the challenges and opportunities of this evolution by helping them to lower their costs
 differentiate their products
 achieve their growth objectives
 and satisfy their customers.&#160; Through ongoing product applications research
 we develop solutions designed to help food manufacturers solve formulation and product challenges and capture market opportunities with high quality




 taste




 2013




 we opened an industrial division seeking to serve a variety of industries
 including
 but not limited to
 oil drilling
 hydraulic fracturing
 petroleum coking
 pharmaceuticals
 nutraceuticals
 paper and corrugated box adhesives



















 as well as small and midsize companies for packaged retail foods
 and (ii) direct and brokered sales to large and small foodservice manufacturers that supply to restaurants
 hospitals
 schools and cafeterias. In addition to direct sales
 we use a network of ingredient distributors
 both domestic and international







 depending on the food application
 required functional properties and product development objectives
 competitive ingredients might include gums (e.g.
 guar
 xanthan
 locust bean
 and Arabic)
 seaweed extracts (e.g.
 alginates
 carrageenan)
 starches (native
 modified and resistant)
 and fibers (e.g.
 oat bran
 corn bran
 pea fiber
 potato fiber).&#160; Most of these competitive ingredients are well-established in the food industry
 and many of the companies that supply them have substantially greater resources than we do.&#160; However
 we believe that the unique properties of our multifunctional fiber ingredients pose not only significant market opportunities for us
 but also provide differentiation and growth opportunities for food companies.&#160; We believe that no other single hydrocolloid or fiber has the combined water holding and binding capacity that is effective across as wide a pH and temperature range as Z Trim&#174;
 nor imparts as many superior attributes to the finished consumer food product.&#160; Furthermore
 we believe Z Trim&#174; ingredients can have synergistic effects with other hydrocolloids and fibers
 allowing food manufacturers to achieve even greater processing improvements
 cost efficiencies
 and finished product performance.&#160; Many of the same ingredients used in foods are also used for industrial applications
 where they compete with a similar complement of ingredients.&#160; We believe that our products&#8217; unique functionalities
 combined with the fact that they are produced domestically from abundant raw material sources (agricultural by-products)







 which are generally available from a variety of suppliers.&#160; Our major suppliers include Agricor
 Inc. and Brenntag
 Inc.&#160; We seek to mitigate the risk of a shortage of raw materials through identification of alternative suppliers for the same or similar raw materials
 where available. We have purchasing staff with extensive knowledge of our products that work with marketing

 2015. There were three significant customers who accounted for 28%
 26% and 6%
 respectively

 as well as trade secrets and know how. Through the process of development and commercialization of our technology
 we have identified and sought patent protection for improvements to the manufacturing process
 product applications and we are currently developing several spin-off technologies.&#160; On December 1
 2009
 we were issued U.S. Patent No. 7
625
591 B2; which expires in 2026 subject to the payment of maintenance fees.&#160; On July 27
 2010
 we were issued U.S. Patent No. 7

 state
 local and foreign laws and regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. Food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal
 state
 local
 and foreign agencies.&#160; However
 as ingredients are made from natural raw material sources (corn and oat)
 they are considered Generally Recognized As Safe or &#8220;GRAS&#8221; and therefore not subject to many of the regulations applicable to foods.&#160; Should the products lose their GRAS designation




 the FDA approved the labeling of our products in meat applications. Specifically
 the FDA has approved the use of our ingredients in ground
 emulsified
 and processed meats and poultry.&#160; We believe this has created and will continue to create the potential for increased sales







 in conjunction with our customers and strategic industry partners
 including the USDA
 continues to work on the development of additional products and applications.&#160; In June 2011
 we entered into a 3-year agreement with the USDA to conduct joint research for the development of additional products and processes relating to its current patented products.&#160; This agreement has been amended and the duration extended through May 31
 2016.&#160; We require all employees and visitors to our plant to execute a non-disclosure agreement.&#160; Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies and to obtain patent coverage for these products and technologies. We intend to continue to file patent applications covering any newly developed products and technologies. However

 Inc.
 a Nevada corporation
 pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into by Z Trim and Agritech on March 18
 2016 (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;).&#160; The Reincorporation was consummated on March 23
 2016 and was effectuated by the filing of (i) articles of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada
 and (ii) articles of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Illinois. The Reincorporation effected a change in our legal domicile form Illinois to Nevada.&#160; Upon the effectiveness of the Reincorporation our affairs of ceased to be governed by (i) Illinois corporation laws

 our operations have been funded primarily through the sale of both equity and debt securities. However
 we still require additional financing to fully implement our business plan for the next twelve months and beyond.&#160; Our current cash on hand is insufficient for us to be able to maintain its operations at the current level through June 30
 2016.&#160; In order to continue to pursue our business plan
 we will require additional funding. If we are not able to secure additional funding
 the implementation of our business plan will be delayed and its ability to maintain or expand operations will be impaired. We intend to secure additional funding through debt or equity financing arrangements

 mainly corn bran and oat hull. Historically
 the costs of corn bran and oat hull are subject to fluctuations depending upon a number of factors which affect commodity prices in general and over which we have no control
 including crop conditions
 weather
 government programs and purchases by foreign governments. Commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material
 packaging
 and energy costs.&#160; We currently do not hedge against changes in commodity prices.&#160; If we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices















 our operation may be subject to labor disruptions and unscheduled downtime
 or other operational hazards inherent in the industry
 such as equipment failures
 fires
 explosions
 abnormal pressures
 blowouts
 pipeline ruptures
 transportation accidents and natural disasters. Some of these operational hazards may cause personal injury or loss of life
 severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or environmental damage
 and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. Our insurance may not be adequate to fully cover the potential operational hazards described above; in addition








 including nutraceuticals
 functional food ingredients
 oils
 and gums.&#160; A large number of businesses are engaged in various fat replacement industries. Many of our competitors have established reputations for successfully developing and marketing their products
 including products that are widely recognized as providing similar calorie reduction. In addition
 many of our competitors have greater financial
 managerial
 and technical resources than we have.&#160;&#160; If we are not successful in competing in these markets




 and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products




 trademarks
 trade secrets
 copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us.&#160; Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products and services.&#160; For example
 effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed.&#160; Also
 the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective.&#160; Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete.&#160; Also




 there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop
 patent or gain access to similar know-how and technology
 or reverse engineer our products







 it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations.&#160; In addition
 given the costs of obtaining patent protection
 we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important.&#160; Furthermore
 there is always the possibility
 despite our efforts







 especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However
 trade secrets are difficult to protect. In order to protect our proprietary technology and processes
 we also rely in part on confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our corporate partners
 employees
 consultants
 outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers and other advisors. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information nor result in the effective assignment to us of intellectual property
 and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or other breaches of the agreements. In addition
 others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information
 and in such case we could not assert any trade secret rights against such party. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult
 expensive and time consuming
 and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition
 courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to seek to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights















 including patent
 trademark
 copyright and trade secret protection.&#160; Our competitors
 however
 may design around our patent claims
 rendering our patent protection ineffective against such competitors.&#160; Similarly
 our competitors may independently develop technology similar to our trade secrets and technical know-how.&#160; Such occurrences could increase competitive pressure on our marketing and sales efforts







 whether meritorious or not
 could be time consuming and result in costly litigation.&#160; If any of our practices are found to be in violation of another party&#8217;s rights
 we may be required to pay monetary damages or licensing fees
 which could be substantial
 or cease making products which are deemed to be infringing.&#160; Any of those occurrences could substantially harm our business




 misbranded
 or mislabeled




 misbranded
 or mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall
 the destruction of product inventory
 and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. In such a case
 or in the event that injuries are determined to arise from our products
 we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity
 damage to our reputation
 and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products








 and compliance with existing or future laws and regulations may require us to incur substantial expenditures or require us to make product recalls.&#160; As such
 we are subject to a broad range of federal
 state
 local and foreign laws and regulations intended to protect public health and the environment.&#160; Food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal
 state
 local
 and foreign agencies.&#160; Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional or different regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions
 causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.&#160; In addition
 we advertise our products.&#160; Our advertisements could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal
 state




 including the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Trade Bureau
 the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
 the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency
 and by various state and local authorities.&#160; Such regulation covers virtually every aspect of our operations
 including production facilities
 marketing
 pricing
 labeling
 packaging
 advertising
 water usage
 waste water discharge
 disposal of hazardous wastes and omissions and other matters.&#160; Violations of any of these laws and regulations may result in administrative
 civil or criminal penalties being levied against us
 permit revocation or modification
 performance of environmental investigatory or remedial activities
 voluntary or involuntary product recalls








 permitting the sale of the products anywhere in the United States without obtaining a license. Should the products lose their GRAS designation
















 including litigation brought by former employees. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings
 we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business
 financial condition and results of operations. In addition
 any significant litigation in the future
 regardless of its merits








 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.&#160; In our annual evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting conducted by management as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 at December 31
 2015
 we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that
 as of December 31
 2015
 we did not maintain effective control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. For a detailed description of these material weaknesses
 see Item 9A
 &#8220;Controls and Procedures
&#8221; herein.&#160; Each of our material weaknesses results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements that we prepare will not be prevented or detected. As a result




 2015
 we carried out an evaluation
 under the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
 of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a &#8211; 15(c) and 15d &#8211; 15(e)).&#160; Based upon that evaluation
 our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that
 as of the end of the period covered in this report
 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer




 or fail to update our internal control over financial reporting as our business evolves
 we may not be able to timely or accurately report our financial condition
 results of operations or cash flows or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to report financial information in a timely and accurate manner or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures
 we could be subject to
 among other things
 regulatory or enforcement actions by the SEC
 securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence







 in part
 on the efforts and abilities of our management team and other key employees. Their skills
 experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration. The failure to attract and retain members of our management team and other key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results. In addition
 transitions of important responsibilities to new individuals inherently include the possibility of disruptions to our business and operations
 which could negatively affect our business
 financial condition



















 investors may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations of our common stock and may experience a lack of buyers to purchase such stock or a lack of market makers to support the stock price.&#160; Being a penny stock also could limit the liquidity of our common stock and limit the coverage of our stock by analysts.&#160; The OTCQB generally provides less liquidity than stock exchanges like NYSE or NASDAQ.&#160; Stocks trading on the OTC markets may be very thinly traded and highly volatile.&#160; Therefore
 holders of our common stock may be unable to sell their shares at any price
 whether or not such shares have been registered for resale.&#160; A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth
 liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common shares at any given time.&#160; This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control.&#160; Given the lower trading volume of our common shares
 significant sales of our common shares
 or the expectation of these sales







 the bid price of our common stock is less than the minimum bid price required to obtain a listing. Trading in our common stock continues to be conducted in the over-the-counter market. As a result
 an investor may find it difficult to dispose of or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock
 and our common stock may be less attractive for margin loans
 for investment by larger financial institutions




 or the loss of




 and may continue to do so.&#160; In 2015 our stock had high and low bid prices of $0.51 and $0.04
 respectively.&#160; In 2014 our stock had high and low bid prices of $1.10 and $0.15


















 the stock market in general has recently experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance or financial condition of individual companies.&#160; Any broad market or industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock




 if instituted against us







 certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144 (&#8220;Rule 144&#8221;)
 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933

 subject to certain limitations. In general
 pursuant to Rule 144
 a stockholder (or stockholders whose shares are aggregated) who has satisfied the required holding period may

 under certain circumstances
 the sale of securities
 without any limitations
 by a non-affiliate of our company that has satisfied a one-year holding period. Any substantial sale of common stock pursuant to Rule 144 or pursuant to any resale prospectus may have an adverse effect on the market price

Because the SEC imposes additional sales practice requirements on brokers who deal in our shares
 which are penny stocks
 some brokers may be unwilling to trade them.&#160; This means that you may have difficulty in reselling your shares and may cause the price of the shares to decline



 subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules
 which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and &#8220;accredited investors&#8221;. The term &#8220;accredited investor&#8221; refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5
000
000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1
000
000 or annual income exceeding $200
000 or $300
000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer
 prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules
 to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock
 the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer&#8217;s account. The bid and offer quotations and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer&#8217;s confirmation. In addition
 the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules
 the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser&#8217;s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently
 these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in

 FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer

 tax status
 investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules
 FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock

 a control system
 no matter how well conceived and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further
 the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
 and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
 within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty
 and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally




 smaller reporting companies face additional limitations. Smaller reporting companies employ fewer individuals and find it difficult to properly segregate duties. Often
 one or two individuals control every aspect of the Company's operation and are in a position to override any system of internal control. Additionally

 Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is an agritech company that owns existing
 and has developed new products and processes to make use of biomass for uses in the food and industrial markets. The Company&#8217;s food division currently sells a line of products to the food industry that can help food manufacturers reduce their costs and help them solve many production problems. The Company&#8217;s technology provides value-added ingredients across virtually all food industry categories. The Company&#8217;s all-natural products
 among other things
 help to reduce fat and calories
 add fiber
 provide shelf-stability
 prevent oil migration
 and add binding capacity &#8211; all without degrading the taste and texture of the final food products. Perhaps most significantly
 Z Trim&#8217;s products can help extend finished products
 and thereby increase its customers&#8217; gross margins. The Company&#8217;s industrial division
 opened in 2012
 plans to sell eco-friendly ingredients to oil drilling

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2015-03
(&#8220;ASU 2015-03&#8221;)
 which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15












 2015
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date (&#8220;ASU 2015-14&#8221;). The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public business entities
 certain not-for-profit entities
 and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning December 15
 2017
 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31
 2016



 2015
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16
 Business Combinations (Topic 805) (&#8220;ASU 2015-16&#8221;). Topic 805 requires that an acquirer retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination
 during the measurement period. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts
 the amendments in the Update require that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is required to also record
 in the same period&#8217;s financial statements
 the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation
 amortization
 or other income effects
 if any
 as a result of the change to the provisional amounts
 calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. In addition an entity is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning December 15



 the FASB issued an accounting standard which provides new guidance that requires share-based compensation to meet a specific performance target to be achieved in order for employees to become eligible to vest in the awards and that could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. As such
 the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation costs should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period
 the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15



 the FASB issued guidance to improve financial reporting by reducing the cost and complexity associated with the incremental reporting requirements of development stage entities. The amendments in this update remove all incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities
 thereby improving financial reporting by eliminating the cost and complexity associated with providing that information. The amendments in this Update also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities in Topic 810
 Consolidation
 for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk. The amendments to eliminate that exception simplify U.S. GAAP by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the relevance of information provided to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting entities. The elimination of the exception may change the consolidation analysis
 consolidation decision
 and disclosure requirements for a reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the development stage. The amendments related to the elimination of inception-to-date information and the other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915 should be applied retrospectively except for the clarification to Topic 275
 which shall be applied prospectively. For public companies
 those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014













 the FASB issued an accounting standard that requires management to assess an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically
 the standard (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management&#8217;s plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&#8217;s plans
 (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated
 and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The standard in this Update is effective for the annual period ending after December 15
 2016


In November 2014
 the FASB issued new guidance for determining when separation of certain embedded derivative features in a hybrid financial instrument is required. That is
 an entity will continue to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to those of the host contract



 the FASB issued guidance to provide an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. After the effective date
 an acquired entity can make an election to apply the guidance to future change-in-control events or to its most recent change-in-control event. However
 if the financial statements for the period in which the most recent change-in-control event occurred already have been issued or made available to be issued
 the application of this guidance would be a change in accounting principle. The amendments in this Update are effective on November 18

 under which the Company may provide customary indemnifications to purchasers of the Company&amp;#8217;s businesses or assets; (ii) certain real estate leases
 under which the Company may be required to indemnify property owners for environmental and other liabilities
 and other claims arising from the Company&amp;#8217;s use of the applicable premises; and (iii) certain agreements with the Company's officers
 directors and employees
 under which the Company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their employment relationship. The terms of such obligations vary. Generally
 a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated. Because the obligated amounts of these types of agreements often are not explicitly stated
 the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically
 the Company has not been obligated to make significant payments for these obligations
 and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on its balance sheet as of December 31
 2015.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;In general
 the Company offers a one-year warranty for most of the products it sells. To date



 the Company incurred net losses

 2007
 the Company and Greg Halpern
 its former Chief Executive Officer in his individual capacity
 were served with a complaint by Joseph Sanfilippo and James Cluck for violation of the Consumer Fraud Act and the plaintiffs are seeking damages in excess of $200
000. The trial court has issued a default order against the Company
 and has denied the Company&amp;#8217;s Motion to reconsider. Management believes that the trial court&amp;#8217;s rulings were erroneous and that it has grounds for appeal
 and that the underlying allegations are frivolous and wholly without merit and will vigorously defends the claim. The outcome of this matter is unknown as of the report date. However
 the Company has accrued a liability in the amount of $102

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&amp;#8220;ASU&amp;#8221;) No. 2015-03
 &lt;font style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: italic;&gt;Interest&amp;#8211;Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) &lt;/font&gt;(&amp;#8220;ASU 2015-03&amp;#8221;)
 which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15

 2015
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date (&amp;#8220;ASU 2015-14&amp;#8221;). The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public business entities
 certain not-for-profit entities
 and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning December 15
 2017
 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31
 2016

 2015
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16
 Business Combinations (Topic 805) (&amp;#8220;ASU 2015-16&amp;#8221;). Topic 805 requires that an acquirer retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination
 during the measurement period. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts
 the amendments in the Update require that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is required to also record
 in the same period&amp;#8217;s financial statements
 the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation
 amortization
 or other income effects
 if any
 as a result of the change to the provisional amounts
 calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. In addition an entity is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning December 15

 the FASB issued an accounting standard which provides new guidance that requires share-based compensation to meet a specific performance target to be achieved in order for employees to become eligible to vest in the awards and that could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. As such
 the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation costs should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period
 the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15

 the FASB issued guidance to improve financial reporting by reducing the cost and complexity associated with the incremental reporting requirements of development stage entities. The amendments in this update remove all incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities
 thereby improving financial reporting by eliminating the cost and complexity associated with providing that information. The amendments in this Update also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities in Topic 810
 Consolidation
 for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk. The amendments to eliminate that exception simplify U.S. GAAP by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the relevance of information provided to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting entities. The elimination of the exception may change the consolidation analysis
 consolidation decision
 and disclosure requirements for a reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the development stage. The amendments related to the elimination of inception-to-date information and the other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915 should be applied retrospectively except for the clarification to Topic 275
 which shall be applied prospectively. For public companies
 those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014

 the FASB issued an accounting standard that requires management to assess an entity&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically
 the standard (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management&amp;#8217;s plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&amp;#8217;s plans
 (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated
 and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The standard in this Update is effective for the annual period ending after December 15
 2016
 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;In November 2014
 the FASB issued new guidance for determining when separation of certain embedded derivative features in a hybrid financial instrument is required. That is
 an entity will continue to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to those of the host contract

 the FASB issued guidance to provide an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. After the effective date
 an acquired entity can make an election to apply the guidance to future change-in-control events or to its most recent change-in-control event. However
 if the financial statements for the period in which the most recent change-in-control event occurred already have been issued or made available to be issued
 the application of this guidance would be a change in accounting principle. The amendments in this Update are effective on November 18

 management analyzes its historical collection experience and current economic trends. If the historical data the Company uses to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&amp;#8220;ASU&amp;#8221;) No. 2015-03
 &lt;font style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: italic;&gt;Interest&amp;#8211;Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) &lt;/font&gt;(&amp;#8220;ASU 2015-03&amp;#8221;)
 which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15

 2015
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date (&amp;#8220;ASU 2015-14&amp;#8221;). The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public business entities
 certain not-for-profit entities
 and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning December 15
 2017
 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31
 2016

 2015
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16
 Business Combinations (Topic 805) (&amp;#8220;ASU 2015-16&amp;#8221;). Topic 805 requires that an acquirer retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination
 during the measurement period. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts
 the amendments in the Update require that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is required to also record
 in the same period&amp;#8217;s financial statements
 the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation
 amortization
 or other income effects
 if any
 as a result of the change to the provisional amounts
 calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. In addition an entity is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning December 15

 the FASB issued an accounting standard which provides new guidance that requires share-based compensation to meet a specific performance target to be achieved in order for employees to become eligible to vest in the awards and that could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. As such
 the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation costs should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period
 the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15

 the FASB issued guidance to improve financial reporting by reducing the cost and complexity associated with the incremental reporting requirements of development stage entities. The amendments in this update remove all incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities
 thereby improving financial reporting by eliminating the cost and complexity associated with providing that information. The amendments in this Update also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities in Topic 810
 Consolidation
 for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk. The amendments to eliminate that exception simplify U.S. GAAP by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the relevance of information provided to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting entities. The elimination of the exception may change the consolidation analysis
 consolidation decision
 and disclosure requirements for a reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the development stage. The amendments related to the elimination of inception-to-date information and the other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915 should be applied retrospectively except for the clarification to Topic 275
 which shall be applied prospectively. For public companies
 those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014

 the FASB issued an accounting standard that requires management to assess an entity&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically
 the standard (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management&amp;#8217;s plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&amp;#8217;s plans
 (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated
 and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The standard in this Update is effective for the annual period ending after December 15
 2016
 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;In November 2014
 the FASB issued new guidance for determining when separation of certain embedded derivative features in a hybrid financial instrument is required. That is
 an entity will continue to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to those of the host contract

 the FASB issued guidance to provide an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. After the effective date
 an acquired entity can make an election to apply the guidance to future change-in-control events or to its most recent change-in-control event. However
 if the financial statements for the period in which the most recent change-in-control event occurred already have been issued or made available to be issued
 the application of this guidance would be a change in accounting principle. The amendments in this Update are effective on November 18

 additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected. As of December 31

The Company generally recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 delivery has occurred
 the fee is fixed or determinable
 and collectability is probable. In instances where the final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer
Management of the Company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed
 provisions are provided at differing rates
 based upon the age of the receivable. In determining these percentages
 management analyzes its historical collection experience and current economic trends. If the historical data the Company uses to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables
 additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected. As of December 31
 2015 and 2014
For purposes of the statement of cash flows
 the Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents as of December 31
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market

Basic net income (loss) per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding for the period.

The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payment awards made to employees and directors
 including stock options
 restricted stock and employee stock purchases related to employee stock purchase plans
 on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite service periods. We estimate the fair value of each share-based award using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes model is highly complex and dependent on key estimates by management. The estimates with the greatest degree of subjective judgment are the estimated lives of the stock-based awards and the estimated volatility of our stock price. The Company recognized pre-tax compensation expense related to stock options of $570

In April 2015
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2015-03
(&#8220;ASU 2015-03&#8221;)
 which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
In August
 2015
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date (&#8220;ASU 2015-14&#8221;). The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public business entities
 certain not-for-profit entities
 and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning December 15
 2017
 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31
 2016
In September
 2015
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16
 Business Combinations (Topic 805) (&#8220;ASU 2015-16&#8221;). Topic 805 requires that an acquirer retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination
 during the measurement period. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts
 the amendments in the Update require that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is required to also record
 in the same period&#8217;s financial statements
 the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation
 amortization
 or other income effects
 if any
 as a result of the change to the provisional amounts
 calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. In addition an entity is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning December 15
In June 2014
 the FASB issued an accounting standard which provides new guidance that requires share-based compensation to meet a specific performance target to be achieved in order for employees to become eligible to vest in the awards and that could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. As such
 the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation costs should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period
 the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15
In June 2014
 the FASB issued guidance to improve financial reporting by reducing the cost and complexity associated with the incremental reporting requirements of development stage entities. The amendments in this update remove all incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities
 thereby improving financial reporting by eliminating the cost and complexity associated with providing that information. The amendments in this Update also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities in Topic 810
 Consolidation
 for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk. The amendments to eliminate that exception simplify U.S. GAAP by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the relevance of information provided to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting entities. The elimination of the exception may change the consolidation analysis
 consolidation decision
 and disclosure requirements for a reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the development stage. The amendments related to the elimination of inception-to-date information and the other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915 should be applied retrospectively except for the clarification to Topic 275
 which shall be applied prospectively. For public companies
 those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014
In August 2014
 the FASB issued an accounting standard that requires management to assess an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically
 the standard (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management&#8217;s plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&#8217;s plans
 (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated
 and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The standard in this Update is effective for the annual period ending after December 15
 2016
In November 2014
 the FASB issued new guidance for determining when separation of certain embedded derivative features in a hybrid financial instrument is required. That is
 an entity will continue to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to those of the host contract
In November 2014
 the FASB issued guidance to provide an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. After the effective date
 an acquired entity can make an election to apply the guidance to future change-in-control events or to its most recent change-in-control event. However
 if the financial statements for the period in which the most recent change-in-control event occurred already have been issued or made available to be issued
 the application of this guidance would be a change in accounting principle. The amendments in this Update are effective on November 18
 2014. The adoption of ASU 2014-17 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

The Company from time to time enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require the Company to indemnify parties against third party claims. These contracts primarily relate to: (i) divestiture agreements
 under which the Company may provide customary indemnifications to purchasers of the Company&#8217;s businesses or assets; (ii) certain real estate leases
 under which the Company may be required to indemnify property owners for environmental and other liabilities
 and other claims arising from the Company&#8217;s use of the applicable premises; and (iii) certain agreements with the Company's officers
 directors and employees
 under which the Company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their employment relationship. The terms of such obligations vary. Generally
 a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated. Because the obligated amounts of these types of agreements often are not explicitly stated
 the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically

The Company generally recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 delivery has occurred
 the fee is fixed or determinable
 and collectability is probable. In instances where the final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer
 revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. No provisions were established for estimated product returns and allowances based on the Company&#8217;s historical experience.




Management of the Company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed
 provisions are provided at differing rates
 based upon the age of the receivable. In determining these percentages
 management analyzes its historical collection experience and current economic trends. If the historical data the Company uses to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables
 additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected. As of December 31
 2015 and 2014
 the allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.




For purposes of the statement of cash flows
 the Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents as of December 31
 2015 and 2014.




Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market
 using the first-in
 first-out method. The Company follows standard costing methods for manufactured products.




Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives of five to ten years are used for machinery and equipment
 office equipment and furniture
 and automobile. Estimated useful lives of up to five years are used for computer equipment and related software. Depreciation and amortization of leasehold improvements are computed using the term of the lease.




The amount of current and deferred taxes payable or refundable is recognized as of the date of the financial statements
 utilizing currently enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred tax expenses or benefits are recognized in the financial statements for the changes in deferred tax liabilities or assets between years.




All derivatives have been recorded on the balance sheet at fair value based on the lattice model calculation. These derivatives
 including embedded derivatives in the Company&#8217;s warrants which have reset provisions to the exercise price and conversion price if the Company issues equity or other derivatives at a price less than the exercise price set forth in such warrants
 are separately valued and accounted for on the Company&#8217;s balance sheet. Fair values for exchange traded securities and derivatives are based on quoted market prices. Where market prices are not readily available
 fair values are determined using market based pricing models incorporating readily observable market data and requiring judgment and estimates.




The Company valued the warrants and the conversion features in its formerly outstanding convertible notes and preferred stock using a lattice valuation model
 with the assistance of a valuation consultant. The lattice model values these instruments based on a probability weighted discounted cash flow model. The Company uses the model to develop a set of potential scenarios. Probabilities of each scenario occurring during the remaining term of the instruments are determined based on management's projections and the expert&#8217;s calculations. These probabilities are used to create a cash flow projection over the term of the instruments and determine the probability that the projected cash flow will be achieved. A discounted weighted average cash flow for each scenario is then calculated and compared to the discounted cash flow of the instruments without the compound embedded derivative in order to determine a value for the compound embedded derivative.




The Company&#8217;s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 inventory
 accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The estimated fair value of cash
 accounts receivable
The Company utilizes various types of financing to fund its business needs
 including convertible debt with warrants attached. The Company reviews its warrants and conversion features of securities issued as to whether they are freestanding or contain an embedded derivative and
 if so
 whether they are classified as a liability at each reporting period until the amount is settled and reclassified into equity with changes in fair value recognized in current earnings. At December 31
 2015 and 2014
 the Company had warrants to purchase common stock
Level three &#8212; Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions
Determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter. The Company&#8217;s only asset or liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis is its derivative liability associated with warrants to purchase common stock and preferred stock. The fair value of the derivative liabilities at December 31
 2015 and 2014 was $742
833 and $20
166
 respectively. The increase in the derivative liability for the twelve months ended December 31
 2015 was $722

Basic net income (loss) per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding and
 when diluted
 potential shares from options and warrants to purchase common stock using the treasury stock method. Diluted net loss per common share does not differ from basic net loss per common share since potential shares of common stock are anti-dilutive for all periods presented.









The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payment awards made to employees and directors
 including stock options
 restricted stock and employee stock purchases related to employee stock purchase plans
 on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite service periods. We estimate the fair value of each share-based award using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes model is highly complex and dependent on key estimates by management. The estimates with the greatest degree of subjective judgment are the estimated lives of the stock-based awards and the estimated volatility of our stock price. The Company recognized pre-tax compensation expense related to stock options of $570
650 and $935
097 for the years ended December 31
 2015 and 2014
 respectively.




In April 2015
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2015-03
(&#8220;ASU 2015-03&#8221;)
 which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
In August
 2015
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date (&#8220;ASU 2015-14&#8221;). The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public business entities
 certain not-for-profit entities
 and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning December 15
 2017
 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31
 2016
In September
 2015
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16
 Business Combinations (Topic 805) (&#8220;ASU 2015-16&#8221;). Topic 805 requires that an acquirer retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination
 during the measurement period. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts
 the amendments in the Update require that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is required to also record
 in the same period&#8217;s financial statements
 the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation
 amortization
 or other income effects
 if any
 as a result of the change to the provisional amounts
 calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. In addition an entity is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning December 15
In June 2014
 the FASB issued an accounting standard which provides new guidance that requires share-based compensation to meet a specific performance target to be achieved in order for employees to become eligible to vest in the awards and that could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. As such
 the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation costs should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period
 the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15
In June 2014
 the FASB issued guidance to improve financial reporting by reducing the cost and complexity associated with the incremental reporting requirements of development stage entities. The amendments in this update remove all incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities
 thereby improving financial reporting by eliminating the cost and complexity associated with providing that information. The amendments in this Update also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities in Topic 810
 Consolidation
 for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk. The amendments to eliminate that exception simplify U.S. GAAP by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the relevance of information provided to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting entities. The elimination of the exception may change the consolidation analysis
 consolidation decision
 and disclosure requirements for a reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the development stage. The amendments related to the elimination of inception-to-date information and the other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915 should be applied retrospectively except for the clarification to Topic 275
 which shall be applied prospectively. For public companies
 those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014
In August 2014
 the FASB issued an accounting standard that requires management to assess an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically
 the standard (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management&#8217;s plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&#8217;s plans
 (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated
 and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The standard in this Update is effective for the annual period ending after December 15
 2016
In November 2014
 the FASB issued new guidance for determining when separation of certain embedded derivative features in a hybrid financial instrument is required. That is
 an entity will continue to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to those of the host contract
In November 2014
 the FASB issued guidance to provide an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. After the effective date
 an acquired entity can make an election to apply the guidance to future change-in-control events or to its most recent change-in-control event. However
 if the financial statements for the period in which the most recent change-in-control event occurred already have been issued or made available to be issued
 the application of this guidance would be a change in accounting principle. The amendments in this Update are effective on November 18
 2014. The adoption of ASU 2014-17 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
