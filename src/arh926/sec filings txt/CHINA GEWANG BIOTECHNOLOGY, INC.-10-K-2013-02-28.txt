Rich Star Development Corporation (&#8220;we
&#8221; &#8220;our
&#8221; &#8220;us
&#8221; or &#8220;the Company&#8221;) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 29
 2009.








We intend to source and distribute food products
 paper products
 janitorial products
 restaurant utensils and equipment.





Our future plans include buying products directly from factories
 participating in joint ventures and branding products to achieve best possible cost levels and maximize profitability.

















Industry sources estimate that there are more than 15
000 companies engaged in food service distribution in the United States. Our customers may also choose to purchase products directly from retail outlets or negotiate prices directly with our suppliers.


Many of our competitors have significant advantages over our Company in terms of scale
 operating histories
 number of locations in operation
 customer base
 capital and other resources.&#160;&#160;The intense competition constitutes significant risk factors for our operations in the industry.


We are&#160;a start-up company that has yet to commence commercial operations. Accordingly
 there can be no assurances that we can successfully compete in the food service distribution market.





















As a distributor of food products
 we will be subject to the U.S. Federal Food
 Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).


The FDA regulates food safety through various statutory and regulatory mandates. The agency also specifies the standards of identity for certain foods
 prescribes the format and content of information required to appear on food product labels
 regulates food contact packaging and materials
 and maintains a Reportable Food Registry for the industry to report when there is a reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences.


For certain product lines
 we may also be subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act
 the Poultry Products Inspection Act
 the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act
 the Packers and Stockyard Act and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to interpret and implement these statutory provisions. The USDA imposes standards for product safety
 quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry inspection program. The USDA reviews and approves the labeling of these products and also establishes standards for the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers.


We are also subject to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002
 which imposes certain registration and record keeping requirements on facilities that manufacture
 process
 pack or hold food for human or animal consumption.


We are also subject to regulation by numerous federal
 state and local regulatory agencies
 including
 but not limited to
 the U.S. Department of Labor
 which set employment practice standards for workers
 and the U.S. Department of Transportation
 which regulate transportation of perishable and hazardous materials and waste
 and similar state
 provincial and local agencies.


Compliance with these laws is not anticipated to have a material effect on our capital expenditures
 earnings or competitive position.





We do not own
 either legally or beneficially
 any patents or trademarks.










































Our principal corporate offices are located at 10300 Charleston Boulevard
 Las Vegas
 Nevada 89135. We do not have a lease agreement for the space and our usage of the space could be terminated at any time.















From time to time
 we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have
 individually or in the aggregate
 a material adverse affect on our business
 financial condition or operating results.

We intend to become a distribution company that will import and source locally
 products in the food service business. We are in the developmental stage and have not yet implemented our business plan.


















The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included herewith. This discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future
 or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future.

For the years ended December 31
 2012 and 2011 and for the period from May 29
 2009 (inception) to December 10
 2012:




We did not generate any revenue during the period from May 29
 2009 (inception) to December 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;During this development stage
 we were primarily focused on corporate organization
 the initial public offering and the development of our business plan.



Our total expenses for the year ended December 31
 2012 were $26
055 for general
 administrative and interest expenses
 as compared to $27
090 for the year ended December 31
 2011.&#160;&#160;The largest components of general and administrative expense were professional fees in the amounts of $18
565 and $21
500
 respectively.


Our total expenses for the period from May 29
 2009 (inception) to December 31
 2012 were $139
556 for general
 administrative and interest expenses.&#160;&#160;The largest components of general and administrative expense during that period were professional fees in the amount of $59
785 and consulting fees in the amount of $65
000.




Our net loss for the year ended December 31
 2012 was $26
055 as compared to a net loss of $27
090 for the year ended December 31
 2011.&#160;&#160;Our accumulated deficit for the period from May 29
 2009 (inception) to December 31
 2012 was $139
556.




As of December 31
 2012 we had no current assets
 current liabilities of $35
760 and a working capital deficit of $35
760 as compared to current asset of $115
 current liabilities of $12
116 and working capital deficit of $12
001 at December 31
 2011.





During the year ended December 31
 2012
 we used cash in the amount of $34
437 for operating activities. This included a net loss of $26
055
 imputed interest of $2
296 and a $10
678 decrease in accounts payable.


By comparison

 2011
 we used cash in the amount of $23
850 for operating activities. This included a net loss of $27
090 offset by a $3
240 increase in accounts payable.


During the period from May 29
 2009 (inception) to December 31
 2012
 we used $135
338 of cash in operating activities.&#160;&#160;This included a net loss of $139
556
 imputed interest of $2
296
 stock issued for services in the amount of $1
500 and a $422 increase in accounts payable.





There were no investing activities for the year ended December 31
 2012 and 2011 or for the period from May 29
 2009 (inception) to December 31
 2012.





During the year ended December 31
 2012
 we received stockholder advances in the amount of $34
322 for total cash provided by financing activities of $34
322.


By comparison
 during the year ended December 31
 2011
 we received stockholder advances in the amount of $1
016 for total cash provided by financing activities of $1
016.
















From May 29
 2009 (inception) to December 31
 2011
 we received stockholder advances in the amount of $100
338
 repaid $65
000 due to the stockholder and received proceeds from issuance of common stock in the amount of $100
000 for total cash provided by financing activities of $135
338.


Due to our brief history and historical net losses

 our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital.


We presently do not have any available credit
 financing or other external sources of liquidity.&#160;&#160;In order to obtain capital
 we may need to sell additional shares of common stock or borrow funds from private lenders.&#160;&#160;However
 the low trading price of our common stock and a downturn in the U.S. stock and debt markets is likely to make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity or debt securities.&#160;&#160;As a result
 there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional funding.


Even if we are able to raise the funds required
 it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses
 fail to collect amounts owed to us
 or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing.&#160;&#160;Further
 if we issue additional equity or debt securities
 stockholders may experience dilution or the new equity securities may have rights
 preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock.





As reflected in the accompanying financial statements
 we had a net loss of $26
055
 net cash used in operations of $34
437 and a working capital deficit and stockholders&#8217; deficit of $35
760 at December 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;We have had no revenues and incurred losses since inception resulting in a deficit accumulated during the development stage of $139
556.


Our ability to continue operations is dependent on Management's plans
 which include the raising of capital through debt and/or equity markets until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements.


The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis
 which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.&#160;&#160;These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.





 start-up wholesale distribution company that plans to import and source locally products in the food service business including food
 paper
 janitorial products
 restaurant utensils and equipment.


Our ability to commence operations is entirely dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital.&#160;&#160;If we cannot raise additional capital
 we will not be able to establish a base of operations to generate revenue.&#160;&#160;We do not have any formal or informal agreements to attain such financing.&#160;&#160;We cannot assure any investor that
 if needed
 sufficient financing can be obtained or
 if obtained
 that it will be on reasonable terms. &#160;

Upon receipt of sufficient financing

 establish joint ventures and develop private brand products to achieve the best possible cost levels and maximize profitability.&#160;&#160;We have no current plans
 proposals or arrangements
 written or otherwise
 to seek a business combination with another entity in the near future.




Our financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions
 judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets
 liabilities
 revenues and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies
 risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.&#160;&#160;
















Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 of our financial statements. While all these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations
 we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our management believes that given current facts and circumstances
 it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause effect on our results of operations
 financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.

We believe the following critical accounting policies and procedures
 among others
 affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements:





Our financial statements are presented as those of a development stage enterprise. Activities during the development stage primarily include negotiating distribution agreements and marketing the territory for product distribution outlets.&#160;&#160;While seeking to implement its business plan
 we will look to obtain additional debt and/or equity related funding opportunities.&#160;&#160;We have not generated any revenues since inception.





The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.&#160;&#160;Such estimates and assumptions have an impact on the fair value of share-based payments
 estimates and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing and expected future operating losses.


Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition
 situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements
 which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly
 the actual results could differ significantly from estimates.





We consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.&#160;&#160;There were no cash equivalents at December 31
 2012 and 2011
 respectively.





We recognizes share-based compensation
 including stock option grants
 warrants
 restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights
 at their fair value on the grant date. Share based payment awards issued to non-employees for services rendered are recorded at either the fair value of the services rendered or the fair value of the share-based payment
 whichever is more readily determinable.&#160;&#160;Compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period.&#160;&#160;





In May 2011
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;the FASB&#8221;) issued guidance to provide a consistent definition of fair value and to ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).&#160;&#160;The guidance also expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs. This new guidance should be applied prospectively and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15
 2011. Early adoption by public entities is not permitted. We adopted this guidance as of January 1
 2012 without a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.&#160;




We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
 financings
 or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons
 also known as &#8220;special purpose entities&#8221; (SPEs).
















































































Disclosure controls and procedures

 Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Act is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.&#160;&#160;Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act
 requires us to carry out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;This evaluation was implemented under the supervision and with the participation of our 


 on this evaluation
 management concluded that
 as of December 31
 2012
 our disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is (1) recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported in a timely manner and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.















We were unable to maintain any segregation of duties within our financial operations due to our reliance on limited personnel in the finance function. While this control deficiency did not result in any audit adjustments to our financial statements
 it could have resulted in a material misstatement that might have been prevented or detected by a segregation of duties;































We do not have an independent Board of Directors
 nor do we have a board member designated as an independent financial expert. The Board of Directors is comprised of two members who also serve as executive officers.&#160;&#160;As a result
 there is a lack of independent oversight of the management team
 lack of independent review of our operating and financial results
 and lack of independent review of disclosures made by us; and





















To the extent reasonably possible given our limited resources
 we intend to take measures to cure the aforementioned weaknesses
 including
 but not limited to
 the following:


















































































he recited remedial actions will require that we hire or engage additional personnel
 these material weaknesses may not be overcome in the near-term due to our limited financial resources. Until such remedial actions can be realized
 we will continue to rely on the limited advice of outside professionals and consultants.&#160;&#160;These initiatives will be subject to our ability to obtain sufficient future financing and subject to our ability to start generating revenue.





Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
 as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.&#160;&#160;Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.&#160;&#160;Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.&#160;&#160;Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


Our officers have assessed the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;In making this assessment
 management used the criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based upon its assessment
 management concluded that
 as of December 31
 2012
 our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective.


Management has identified a lack of sufficient personnel in the accounting function due to our limited resources with appropriate skills
 training and experience to perform the review processes to ensure the complete and proper application of generally accepted accounting principles.&#160;&#160;We are in the process of developing and implementing remediation plans to address our material weaknesses in our internal controls.





































Due to its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.&#160;&#160;Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems
 no matter how well designed
 have inherent limitations. Therefore
 even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.








During the fourth quarter ended December 31
 2012
 there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31
 2012




Rich Star Development Corporation (&#8220;the Company&#8221;) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 29
 2009.

 wholesale distribution company that plans to import and source locally products in the food service business including food
 paper products
 janitorial products
 restaurant utensils and equipment.









 - The Company's financial statements are presented as those of a development stage enterprise. Activities during the development stage primarily include negotiating distribution agreements and marketing the territory for product distribution outlets.&#160;&#160;The Company
 while seeking to implement its business plan
 will look to obtain additional debt and/or equity related funding opportunities. The Company has not generated any revenues since inception.

 - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.&#160;&#160;Such estimates and assumptions have an impact on the fair value of share-based payments
 estimates and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing and expected future operating losses.

Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition
 situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements
 which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly
 the actual results could differ significantly from estimates.

 - The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.&#160;&#160;There were no cash equivalents at December 31
 2012 and 2011
 respectively.


cash balances at an institution that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.&#160;&#160;As of December 31
 2012 no 



















FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31
 2012


 - The Company adopted the FASB standard related to fair value measurement at inception. The standard defines fair value
 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. The standard applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and
 accordingly
 does not require any new fair value measurements. The standard clarifies that fair value is an exit price
 representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such
 fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The recorded values of long-term debt approximate their fair values
 as interest approximates market rates. As a basis for considering such assumptions
 the standard established a three-tier fair value hierarchy
 which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows.


























Level 2:&#160;&#160;Inputs
 other than quoted prices in active markets
 that are observable either directly or indirectly; and














Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data
 which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.






 - The Company recognizes share-based compensation
 including stock option grants
 warrants
 restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights
 at their fair value on the grant date. Share based payment awards issued to non-employees for services rendered are recorded at either the fair value of the services rendered or the fair value of the share-based payment
 whichever is more readily determinable.&#160;&#160;Compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period.&#160;&#160;

The payment of dividends by the Company in the future will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on earnings
 capital requirements and financial condition
 as well as other relevant factors.&#160;&#160; The Company does not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future but intend to retain all earnings
 if any
 for use in the business.

 - Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period.&#160;&#160;Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss)
 adjusted for changes in income or loss that resulted from the assumed conversion of convertible shares
 by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
 common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period.


















FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31
 2012


The computation of basic and diluted loss per share for the periods presented is equivalent since the Company had continuing losses. The Company had no common stock equivalents as of December 31
 2012.

 - The Company&#8217;s operations and future are dependent in a large part on its ability to develop its business model in a competitive market.&#160;&#160;The Company intends to operate in an industry that is subject to intense competition and change in consumer demand. The Company's operations are subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial and operational risks and the potential risk of business failure. The Company&#8217;s inability to meet its business plan and target customer demand may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition
 results of operations and cash flows.



Assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable requires significant judgment. The Company considers all available positive and negative evidence
 including historical operating performance and expectations of future operating performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is often dependent upon future taxable income and therefore can be uncertain. To the extent the Company believes it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized
 valuation allowances are established against the Company&#8217;s deferred tax assets
 which increase income tax expense in the period when such a determination is made.

Income taxes include the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. Settlements with tax authorities
 the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions
 or obtaining new information on particular tax positions may cause a change to the effective tax rate. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on the statements of operations.

In May 2011
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;the FASB&#8221;) issued guidance to provide a consistent definition of fair value and to ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).&#160;&#160;The guidance also expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs. This new guidance should be applied prospectively and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15
 2011. Early adoption by public entities is not permitted. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1
 2012 without a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.&#160;


















FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31
 2012







As reflected in the accompanying financial statements
 the Company had a net loss of $26
055
 net cash used in operations of $34
437 and a working capital deficit and stockholders&#8217; deficit of $35
760 at December 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;The Company had no revenues and incurred losses since inception resulting in a deficit accumulated during the development stage of $139
556.

The ability of the Company to continue its operations is dependent on Management's plans
 which include the raising of capital through debt and/or equity markets until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis
 which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.&#160;&#160;These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.



During the year ended December 31
 2009
 the Company received stockholder advances in the amount of $50
000 for general and administrative purposes.&#160;&#160;In January 2010
 the stockholder advanced an additional $15
000.&#160;&#160;In January 2010
 the $65
000 was repaid.

As of December 31
 2012
 the stockholder advanced an additional $35
338 for general working capital purposes.&#160;&#160;All advances are non-interest bearing
 unsecured
 and due on demand.&#160;&#160;See Note 7 for additional advances subsequent to December 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;Imputed interest of $2
296 was recorded to donated capital at 8% for the year ended December 31
 2012.



The Company had net operating loss carry forwards for income tax reporting purposes of $139
556 and $113
501 as of December 31
 2012 and 2011
 respectively.&#160;&#160;These carry forwards may be used to offset against future taxable income and begin to expire in the year 2029.&#160;&#160;Current tax laws limit the amount of loss available to be offset against future taxable income when a substantial change in ownership occurs or a change in the nature of the business.&#160;&#160;Therefore
 the amount available to offset future taxable income may be limited.

No tax benefit has been reported in the financial statements for the realization of loss carry forwards
 as the Company believes there is high probability that the carry forwards will not be utilized in the foreseeable future.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 the potential tax benefits of the loss carry forwards are offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount.


















FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31
 2012


Significant components of the Company&#8217;s deferred tax liabilities and assets as of December 31
 2012 and 2011 are as follows:

 at $0.001 per share having a fair value of $1

 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. The standard applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and
 accordingly
 does not require any new fair value measurements. The standard clarifies that fair value is an exit price
 representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such
 fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The recorded values of long-term debt approximate their fair values
 as interest approximates market rates. As a basis for considering such assumptions
 the standard established a three-tier fair value hierarchy

 other than quoted prices in active markets

 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. The standard applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and
 accordingly
 does not require any new fair value measurements. The standard clarifies that fair value is an exit price
 representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such
 fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The recorded values of long-term debt approximate their fair values
 as interest approximates market rates. As a basis for considering such assumptions
 the standard established a three-tier fair value hierarchy

 other than quoted prices in active markets


 including stock option grants
 warrants
 restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights
 at their fair value on the grant date. Share based payment awards issued to non-employees for services rendered are recorded at either the fair value of the services rendered or the fair value of the share-based payment
 whichever is more readily determinable.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt; text-align: justify; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=DISPLAY: block; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt; text-align: justify; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt&gt; &lt;font style=DISPLAY: inline; TEXT-DECORATION: underline&gt;Dividends&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font style=DISPLAY: inline&gt;The payment of dividends by the Company in the future will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on earnings

The Company&amp;#39;s operations are subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial and operational risks and the potential risk of business failure. The Company&amp;#39;s inability to meet its business plan and target customer demand may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition

 including historical operating performance and expectations of future operating performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is often dependent upon future taxable income and therefore can be uncertain. To the extent the Company believes it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized
 valuation allowances are established against the Company&amp;#39;s deferred tax assets
 which increase income tax expense in the period when such a determination is made.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt; text-align: justify; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=DISPLAY: block; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt; text-align: justify; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt&gt; Income taxes include the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position.

 the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions
 or obtaining new information on particular tax positions may cause a change to the effective tax rate. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on the statements of operations.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt; text-align: justify; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=DISPLAY: block; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt; text-align: justify; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt&gt; &lt;font style=DISPLAY: inline; TEXT-DECORATION: underline&gt;Recent Accounting Pronouncements&lt;/font&gt; - In May 2011

 - The Company&#39;s financial statements are presented as those of a development stage enterprise. Activities during the development stage primarily include negotiating distribution agreements and marketing the territory for product distribution outlets.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company
 while seeking to implement its business plan
 - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such estimates and assumptions have an impact on the fair value of share-based payments
 Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition
 situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements
 which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly
 - The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no cash equivalents at December 31
 2012 and 2011
cash balances at an institution that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December 31
 - The Company adopted the FASB standard related to fair value measurement at inception. The standard defines fair value
 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. The standard applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and
 accordingly
 does not require any new fair value measurements. The standard clarifies that fair value is an exit price
 representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such
 fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The recorded values of long-term debt approximate their fair values
 as interest approximates market rates. As a basis for considering such assumptions
 the standard established a three-tier fair value hierarchy
 Level 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;Inputs
 other than quoted prices in active markets
 Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data
 - The Company recognizes share-based compensation
 including stock option grants
 warrants
 restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights
 at their fair value on the grant date. Share based payment awards issued to non-employees for services rendered are recorded at either the fair value of the services rendered or the fair value of the share-based payment
The payment of dividends by the Company in the future will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on earnings
 capital requirements and financial condition
 as well as other relevant factors.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company does not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future but intend to retain all earnings
 if any
 - Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period.&nbsp;&nbsp;Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss)
 adjusted for changes in income or loss that resulted from the assumed conversion of convertible shares
 by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
 The computation of basic and diluted loss per share for the periods presented is equivalent since the Company had continuing losses. The Company had no common stock equivalents as of December 31
 - The Company&#39;s operations and future are dependent in a large part on its ability to develop its business model in a competitive market.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company intends to operate in an industry that is subject to intense competition and change in consumer demand. The Company&#39;s operations are subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial and operational risks and the potential risk of business failure. The Company&#39;s inability to meet its business plan and target customer demand may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition
 Assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable requires significant judgment. The Company considers all available positive and negative evidence
 including historical operating performance and expectations of future operating performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is often dependent upon future taxable income and therefore can be uncertain. To the extent the Company believes it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized
 valuation allowances are established against the Company&#39;s deferred tax assets
 Income taxes include the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. Settlements with tax authorities
 the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions
 - In May 2011
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued guidance to provide a consistent definition of fair value and to ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).&nbsp;&nbsp;The guidance also expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs. This new guidance should be applied prospectively and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15
 2011. Early adoption by public entities is not permitted. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1
 2012 without a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.&nbsp;

 The Company had net operating loss carry forwards for income tax reporting purposes of $139
556 and $113
501 as of December 31
 2012 and 2011
 respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;These carry forwards may be used to offset against future taxable income and begin to expire in the year 2029.&nbsp;&nbsp;Current tax laws limit the amount of loss available to be offset against future taxable income when a substantial change in ownership occurs or a change in the nature of the business.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore
 No tax benefit has been reported in the financial statements for the realization of loss carry forwards
 as the Company believes there is high probability that the carry forwards will not be utilized in the foreseeable future.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly

 - The Company&#39;s financial statements are presented as those of a development stage enterprise. Activities during the development stage primarily include negotiating distribution agreements and marketing the territory for product distribution outlets.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company
 while seeking to implement its business plan
 will look to obtain additional debt and/or equity related funding opportunities. The Company has not generated any revenues since inception.


        
 - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such estimates and assumptions have an impact on the fair value of share-based payments
 Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition
 situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements
 which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly
 the actual results could differ significantly from estimates.


        
 - The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no cash equivalents at December 31
 2012 and 2011
cash balances at an institution that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December 31
 2012 no


        
 - The Company adopted the FASB standard related to fair value measurement at inception. The standard defines fair value
 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. The standard applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and
 accordingly
 does not require any new fair value measurements. The standard clarifies that fair value is an exit price
 representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such
 fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The recorded values of long-term debt approximate their fair values
 as interest approximates market rates. As a basis for considering such assumptions
 the standard established a three-tier fair value hierarchy
 Level 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;Inputs
 other than quoted prices in active markets
 Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data
 which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.


        
 - The Company recognizes share-based compensation
 including stock option grants
 warrants
 restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights
 at their fair value on the grant date. Share based payment awards issued to non-employees for services rendered are recorded at either the fair value of the services rendered or the fair value of the share-based payment
 whichever is more readily determinable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period.&nbsp;&nbsp;


        
The payment of dividends by the Company in the future will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on earnings
 capital requirements and financial condition
 as well as other relevant factors.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company does not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future but intend to retain all earnings
 if any
 for use in the business.


        
 - Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period.&nbsp;&nbsp;Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss)
 adjusted for changes in income or loss that resulted from the assumed conversion of convertible shares
 by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
 The computation of basic and diluted loss per share for the periods presented is equivalent since the Company had continuing losses. The Company had no common stock equivalents as of December 31
 2012.


        
 - The Company&#39;s operations and future are dependent in a large part on its ability to develop its business model in a competitive market.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company intends to operate in an industry that is subject to intense competition and change in consumer demand. The Company&#39;s operations are subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial and operational risks and the potential risk of business failure. The Company&#39;s inability to meet its business plan and target customer demand may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition
 results of operations and cash flows.


        
 Assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable requires significant judgment. The Company considers all available positive and negative evidence
 including historical operating performance and expectations of future operating performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is often dependent upon future taxable income and therefore can be uncertain. To the extent the Company believes it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized
 valuation allowances are established against the Company&#39;s deferred tax assets
 Income taxes include the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. Settlements with tax authorities
 the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions
 or obtaining new information on particular tax positions may cause a change to the effective tax rate. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on the statements of operations.


        
 - In May 2011
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued guidance to provide a consistent definition of fair value and to ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).&nbsp;&nbsp;The guidance also expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs. This new guidance should be applied prospectively and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15
 2011. Early adoption by public entities is not permitted. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1
 2012 without a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.&nbsp;
