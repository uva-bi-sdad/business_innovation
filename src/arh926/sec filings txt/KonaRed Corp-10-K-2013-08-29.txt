We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 4
 2010.&#160;&#160;Following incorporation
 we commenced the business of internet social networking.

Our principal executive offices are located 88 College Hill
 Ponsonby
 Auckland
 New Zealand. Our telephone number is 011-64-214-664-45.&#160;&#160;On July 31
 2013
 we incorporated KonaRed Corporation under laws of the State of Nevada as a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company incorporated solely for the purpose of effecting a name change in connection with the Transaction (as defined below). Other than KonaRed Corporation
 we do not have any subsidiaries.




















TeamUpSport Inc. intended to develop and commercialize on its website www.teamupsport.com
 which was to be a website designed to integrate into a single online offering
 people&#8217;s interest in sport with the new capabilities of online social networking.&#160;&#160;Since inception we have worked toward the introduction and development of our website that we will use to generate revenues.&#160;&#160;However
 we have stopped pursuing the use of our website and are currently seeking new business opportunities with established business entities for the merger with or acquisition of a target business. In certain instances
 a target business may wish to become our subsidiary or may wish to contribute assets to us rather than merge.

As of the date hereof
&#8221;)
 as disclosed in a Form 8-K filed on June 11
 2013 and in this report under &#8220;LOI with KonaRed&#8221;
&#8221;)
 a company incorporated in the State of Hawaii
 and we are currently negotiating a definitive formal asset purchase agreement. If such agreement is reached
 we intend to disclose such an agreement by filing another current report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;

Any new acquisition or business opportunities that we may acquire will require additional financing. There can be no assurance
 however
 that we will be able to acquire the financing necessary to enable us to pursue our plan of operation. If our company requires additional financing and we are unable to acquire such funds
 our business may fail.

Management of our company believes that there are benefits to being a reporting company with a class of securities quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board
 such as: (i) the ability to use registered securities to acquire assets or businesses; (ii)&#160;increased visibility in the financial community; (iii) the facilitation of borrowing from financial institutions; (iv)&#160;potentially improved trading efficiency; (v) potential stockholder liquidity; (vi) potentially greater ease in raising capital subsequent to an acquisition; (vii) potential compensation of key employees through stock options; (viii)&#160;potentially enhanced corporate image; and (ix) a presence in the United States capital market.

We may seek a business opportunity with entities who have recently commenced operations
 or entities who wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand business development activities
 to develop a new product or service
 or for other corporate purposes. We may acquire assets and establish wholly-owned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries.

In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition or opportunity
 we may become a party to a merger
 consolidation
 reorganization
 joint venture
 or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon the consummation of a transaction
 it is likely that our present management will no longer be in control of our company. In addition
 it is likely that our officers and directors will
 as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction
 resign and be replaced by one or more new officers and directors.

Currently
 we do not have a source of revenue.&#160;&#160;We are not able to fund our cash requirements through our current operations. Historically
 we have been able to raise a limited amount of capital through private placements of our equity stock
 but we are uncertain about our continued ability to raise funds privately. Further
 we believe that our company may have difficulties raising capital until we enter into a formal agreement or close a transaction where we can pursue our plan of operation. If we are unable to secure adequate capital to continue our acquisition efforts
 our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment and our business may fail.



Our company is currently operated by Richenda Rowe as our President
 Chief Executive Officer
 Chief Financial Officer and sole Director.&#160;&#160;We do not anticipate hiring employees in the near future.



We do not own
 either legally or beneficially
 any patent or trademark.




















As disclosed in a Form 8-K filed on June 11
 2013
 we entered into the LOI with Sandwich Isles
 whereby
 following entry into a formal agreement and the closing
 we propose to purchase all of the assets and business of Sandwich Isles in consideration for the issuance to Sandwich Isles of 42
750
000 (after a 13.5 to one forward stock split) of common stock of our company (the &#8220;

Within seven days of the execution of the LOI
 we arranged a bridge loan from a third party to Sandwich Isles for $500
&#8221;).&#160;&#160;In the event the Transaction closes
 the proceeds of the Bridge Loan will be converted to shares of common stock of our company at a conversion price of $0.45 per share.&#160;&#160;In the event that the Transaction does not occur by September 1
 2013
 unless extended by the Bridge Loan lenders
 the Bridge Loan will be due and payable by December 1
 2013 with interest at 12% per annum calculated monthly from the date of advance.

Pursuant to the LOI
 we agreed to arrange an equity financing for gross proceeds of $500
000 to be closed at the closing of the Transaction
&#8221;). Within six months of the closing of the Transaction
 we also agreed to arrange an additional equity financing for $600
000
 consisting of 1
333
333 units
 each unit comprising one share of common stock and one warrant
 issued at a price of $0.45 per unit.&#160;&#160;It is intended that each warrant will be exercisable for 5 years after closing of the Transaction at an exercise price of $0.65.&#160;&#160;We expect to pay a finder for services in finding the Bridge Loan lender and the Financing purchasers a total of 2
222
222 warrants
 each exercisable for one common share for 5 years after closing of the Transaction at a price of $0.65 per share.

Closing of the Transaction is subject to a number of conditions including
 but not limited to
 the entry into a formal agreement and the closing of the Financing. There is no assurance that the Transaction will close as contemplated or at all.

A copy of the letter agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to our current report on Form 8-K filed on June 11
 2013
 and is incorporated herein by reference.

About Sandwich Isles Trading Company
 Inc. dba KonaRed&#174;

Sandwich Isles Trading Company
&#8221;) is an emerging leader in the branded coffee fruit health food industry. Based in Hawaii and bolstered by supply relationships with Kona-based coffee producers
 KonaRed Antioxidant Juice is being distributed through several major retailers. KonaRed also operates a branded ingredients division for coffee berry powder and extract supply. The sale of fruit powders and extracts allows KonaRed to sell product in health-oriented consumer product venues.



Our business is subject to numerous risk factors
 including the following:























Business opportunities that we believe are in the best interests of our company may be scarce or we may be unable to obtain the ones that we want.&#160;&#160;If we are unable to close the Transaction or obtain a business opportunity that we believe is in the best interests of our company
 we may never recommence operations and may go out of business.&#160;&#160;If we go out of business
 investors will lose their entire investment in our company.

We are
 and will continue to be
 an insignificant participant in the number of companies seeking a suitable business opportunity or business combination. A large number of established and well-financed entities
 including venture capital firms
 are actively seeking suitable business opportunities or business combinations which may also be desirable target candidates for us. Virtually all such entities have significantly greater financial resources
 technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do. We are
 consequently
 at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. We will also compete with numerous other small public companies seeking suitable business opportunities or business combinations.&#160;&#160;If we are unable to close the Transaction or obtain a business opportunity that we believe is in the best interests of our company
 we may never recommence operations and may go out of business.&#160;&#160;If we go out of business
 investors will lose their entire investment in our company.

We have had negative cash flows from operations and if we are not able to obtain further financing
 our business operations may fail.

We had no cash and had accumulated deficit of $56
301 as of May 31
 2013. We anticipate that we will require additional financing while we are closing or seeking a suitable business opportunity or business combination
 including the Transaction. Further
 we anticipate that we will not have sufficient capital to fund our ongoing operations for the next twelve months.

There can be no assurance that
 if required
 any such financing
 including the Financing contemplated in the Transaction
 will be available upon terms and conditions acceptable to us
 if at all. Our inability to obtain additional financing in a sufficient amount when needed and upon terms and conditions acceptable to us could have a material adverse effect upon our company. We will require further funds to finance the development of any business opportunity that we acquire. There can be no assurance that such funds will be available or available on terms satisfactory to us. If additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities
 further dilution to existing or future shareholders is likely to result. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms when needed
 we may be required to delay
 scale back or eliminate the development of any business opportunity that we acquire. Inadequate funding could also impair our ability to compete in the marketplace
 which may result in the dissolution of our company.

We have a limited operating history and if we are not successful in continuing to grow our business
 then we may have to scale back or even cease our ongoing business operations.

We have a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks
 uncertainties
 expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies seeking to acquire or establish a new business opportunity. Some of these risks and uncertainties relate to our ability to identify
 secure and complete an acquisition of a suitable business opportunity.

We cannot be sure that we will be successful in addressing these risks and uncertainties and our failure to do so could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition
 our operating results are dependent to a large degree upon factors outside of our control. There are no assurances that we will be successful in addressing these risks
 and failure to do so may adversely affect our business.


















It is unlikely that we will generate any or significant revenues while we seek a suitable business opportunity. Our short and long-term prospects depend upon our ability to select and secure a suitable business opportunity. In order for us to make a profit
 we will need to successfully acquire a new business opportunity in order to generate revenues in an amount sufficient to cover any and all future costs and expenses in connection with any such business opportunity. Even if we become profitable
 we may not sustain or increase our profits on a quarterly or annual basis in the future.

We will
 in all likelihood
 sustain operating expenses without corresponding revenues
 at least until we complete a business combination or acquire a business opportunity. This may result in our company incurring a net operating loss which will increase continuously until we complete a business combination or acquire a business opportunity that can generate revenues that result in a net profit to us. There is no assurance that we will identify a suitable business opportunity or complete a business combination.

Our independent auditor has indicated that he has substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern
 if true
 you could lose your investment.

Our independent auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern given our lack of operating history and the fact to date have had no revenues. Potential investors should be aware that there are difficulties associated with being a new venture
 and the high rate of failure associated with this fact.&#160;&#160;We have incurred a net loss of $27
754 for the year ended May 31
 2013 and have had no revenues to date. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from our website. These factors raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern.

Because our executive officer does not have experience in accounting and finance
 there is a higher risk our business will fail.



Our sole executive officer has only agreed to provide her services on a part-time basis.&#160;&#160;She may not be able or willing to devote a sufficient amount of time to our business operations
 causing our business to fail.

Because we are in the development stage of our business





Because the sole executive officer is a New Zealand resident
 difficulty may arise in attempting to effect service or process on her in New Zealand or in enforcing a judgment against the registrant&#8217;s assets located outside of the United States.



If we revert back to our initial business
 it is intended that our website will be hosted and maintained by a third party hosting service.&#160;&#160;Any mismanagement
 service interruptions
 or damage to the data of our company or our customers
 could result in the loss of customers
 or other harm to the business.




















If we revert back to our initial business
 our success will
 in part
 depend on our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. Although we have conducted searches and are not aware of any trademarks which our company might infringe
 we cannot be certain that infringement has not or will not occur. We could incur substantial costs
 in addition to the great amount of time lost
 in defending any trademark infringement suits or in asserting any trademark rights
 in suit with another party.



Because we can issue additional shares of common stock
 our stockholders may experience dilution in the future.

We are authorized to issue up to 65
000
000 shares of common stock
 of which 4
766
698 shares are issued and outstanding. Our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue additional shares of common stock
 and to determine the rights
 preferences and privileges of such shares
 without consent of any of our stockholders. Consequently
 the stockholders may experience more dilution in their ownership of our stock in the future.

Trading on the OTC Bulletin Board may be volatile and sporadic
 which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares.

Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. Trading in stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices
 due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover
 the OTC Bulletin Board is not a stock exchange
 and trading of securities on the OTC Bulletin Board is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like NASDAQ a stock exchange like the NYSE. Accordingly
 stockholders may have difficulty reselling any of the shares.

A decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital
 it may adversely impact our ability to continue operations and we may go out of business.

A prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. Because we may attempt to acquire a significant portion of the funds we need in order to conduct our planned operations through the sale of equity securities
 a decline in the price of our common stock could be detrimental to our liquidity and our operations because the decline may cause investors not to choose to invest in our stock. If we are unable to raise the funds we require for all our planned operations
 we may be forced to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may suffer a significant negative effect on our business plan and operations
 including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations. As a result
 our business may suffer
 and not be successful and we may go out of business. We also might not be able to meet our financial obligations if we cannot raise enough funds through the sale of our common stock and we may be forced to go out of business.

Because we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the near future
 our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them.

We intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. The declaration
 payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors
 and will depend upon
 among other things
 the results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition
 operating and capital requirements
 and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid
 and if dividends are paid
 there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend. Unless we pay dividends
 our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them.




















Our stock is a penny stock. The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines &#8220;penny stock&#8221; to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share
 subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules
 which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and &#8220;accredited investors&#8221;. The term &#8220;accredited investor&#8221; refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5
000
000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1
000
000 or annual income exceeding $200
000 or $300
000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer
 prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules
 to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock
 the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer&#8217;s account. The bid and offer quotations
 and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information
 must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer&#8217;s confirmation. In addition
 the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser&#8217;s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently
 these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.



In addition to the &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules promulgated by the SEC
&#8221;) has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer
 a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers
 broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer&#8217;s financial status
 tax status
 investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules
 the FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock
 which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock.

As of August 16
 2013
 there were 23 registered stockholders holding 4
766
698 shares of our issued and outstanding common stock.



There are no restrictions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws that prevent us from declaring dividends. The Nevada Revised Statutes
 however
 do prohibit us from declaring dividends where
 after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend:































We completed an offering of 2
866
689 shares of common stock on October 22
 2010 to our former president and director
 Dennis Kjeldsen
 at a price of $0.005 per share.&#160;&#160;The total proceeds received from this offering were $14
333.49.&#160;&#160;These shares were issued pursuant to Section 4(2) of the 1933 Act and are restricted shares as defined in the 1933&#160;Act.&#160;&#160;We did not engage in any general solicitation or advertising.

We completed an offering of 1
900
000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.02 per share to a total of 31&#160;purchasers on June 1
 2011.&#160;&#160;The total amount we received from this offering was $38
000.&#160;&#160;We completed this offering pursuant Rule 903(a) and conditions set forth in Category 3 (Rule 903(b)(3)) of Regulation S of the 1933&#160;Act.




















We did not purchase any of our shares of common stock or other securities during our fiscal year ended May 31
 2013.











The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans
 estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report.





We have no revenues
 have achieved losses since inception
 have been issued a going concern opinion by our auditors and rely upon the sale of our securities to fund operations. Accordingly
 we will be dependent on future additional financing in order to maintain our operations and continue seeking new business opportunities.

To date
 our company has not been as successful as hoped in implementing our business plan. We have decided to cease development on our website and take our business in another direction.


On June 10
 2013
 we entered into the LOI with Sandwich Isles
 whereby
 following entry into a formal agreement and the closing
 we propose to purchase all of the assets and business of Sandwich Isles in consideration for the issuance to Sandwich Isles of 42
750
000 post-split shares of common stock of our company. See&#160;&#160;&#8220;Item 1.&#160;&#160;Business &#8211; LOI with KonaRed.&#8221;



If we are unable to close the Transaction or a different business acquisition
 we anticipate that we will incur the following expenses over the next 12 months:





















10
000-$15

 whether it is borrowing money or selling shares of our common stock.




















Legal and accounting expenses will include those required to maintain our status as an OTC Bulletin Board company as well as for the legal and accounting work required for the acquisition of the new business opportunity
 including due diligence work by our attorneys.

If we are unable to close the Transaction or a different business acquisition
 we require a minimum of approximately $45
000 to carry out our plan of operation over the next 12 months. As of May 31
 2013
 we had no cash and a working capital deficit of $3
968. If we are unable to close the Transaction or a different business acquisition
 we plan to complete private placement sales of our common stock in order to raise the funds necessary to pursue our plan of operation and to fund our working capital deficit in order to enable us to pay our accounts payable and accrued liabilities. With the exception of the Financing in connection with the Transaction
 we currently do not have any arrangements in place for the completion of any private placement financings and there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any private placement financings.



The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the year ended May 31
 2013 which are included herein.

Our operating results for the year ended May 31

Excluding costs in connection with proceeding to closing the Transaction with Sandwich Isles
 we anticipate that we will incur approximately $10
000 for operating expenses
 including professional
 legal and accounting expenses associated with our reporting requirements under the Exchange Act during the next 12&#160;months.



We used cash in operating activities in the amount of $25
088 during the year ended May 31
 2013 and $24
049 during the year ended May 31
 2012. Cash used in operating activities was funded by cash from financing activities in a prior year.



We received no cash from investing activities during the year ended May 31
 2013 and no cash from investing activities in the year ended May 31
 2012.



We did not receive cash in financing activities during the year ended May 31
 2013 nor did we generate or use any cash from financing activities for the year ended May 31
 2012.




















The financial statements accompanying this report have been prepared on a going concern basis
 which implies that our company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Our company has not generated revenues since inception and has never paid any dividends and is unlikely to pay dividends or generate earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. The continuation of our company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from our shareholders
 the ability of our company to obtain necessary equity financing to achieve our operating objectives
 and the attainment of profitable operations. As at May 31
 2013
 our company has accumulated losses of $56
301 since inception. We do not have sufficient working capital to enable us to carry out our stated plan of operation for the next twelve months. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should our company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our current operating expenses and the capital expenses noted above in their report on the financial statements for the year ended May 31
 2013
 our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors.

The continuation of our business is dependent upon us raising additional financial support. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans
 assuming those loans would be available
 will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.







We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition
 changes in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.



 - Management has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.&#160;&#160;These estimates have a significant impact on our valuation and reserve accounts relating to the allowance for sales returns
 doubtful accounts
 inventory reserves and deferred income taxes.&#160;&#160;Actual results could differ from these estimates.


































TeamUpSport
 Inc. (A development stage company)

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of TeamUpSport
 Inc (the Company) as of May 31
 2013
 and the related statements of operations
 stockholders&#8217; equity/deficit and cash flows for the year then ended and for the period from October 4
 2010 (Inception) through May 31
 2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. The financial statements of the Company as of May 31
 2012 was audited by other auditors
 whose report dated August 29
 2012
 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and also included an explanatory paragraph that raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern.


We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company was not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion
 the financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of May 31
 2013
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended and for the period from October 4
 2010 (Inception) through May 31
 2013
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements
 the Company has had no revenues and income since inception. These conditions
 among others
 raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans concerning these matters are also described in Note 2
 which includes the raising of additional equity financing or merger with another entity. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

May 31
 2013 and 2012








TeamUpSport Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada October 4
 2010. The Company was organized for the purpose of engaging in an internet social networking business but has recently decided to seek other opportunities.&#160;&#160;It remains a development stage company and is actively seeking business opportunities with other businesses.&#160;&#160;The Company adopted May 31 as its fiscal year-end.











These financial statements presented as of and for the years ended May 31
 2013 and 2012 reflect all adjustments which
 in the opinion of management
 are necessary to present fairly the financial position
 results of operations and cash flows for the period presented in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.








The Company considers all liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase that are readily convertible into cash to be cash equivalents.&#160;&#160;The Company does not have any cash equivalents at May 31
 2013 and 2012.





The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.&#160;&#160;Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management are
 among others
 deferred taxes.










The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASC (Accounting Standards Codification) 820-10 (SFAS No. 157)
 &#8220;Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures&#8221; for financial assets and liabilities.&#160;ASC&#160;820-10 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements.&#160;&#160;FASB ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price&#160;&#160;that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.&#160;&#160;


















FASB ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
 where available. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required by the standard that the Company uses to measure fair value:




























Level 2:&#160;&#160;Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices
 such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities;&#160;&#160;quoted prices in markets that are not active
 or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities.


























The Company utilizes FASB ACS 740
 &#8220;Income Taxes
&#8221; which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns.&#160;&#160;Under this method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.&#160;&#160;A valuation allowance is recorded when it is &#8220;more likely-than-not&#8221; that a deferred tax asset will not be realized

The Company generated a deferred tax credit through its net operating loss carryforwards.&#160;&#160;However
 a valuation allowance of 100% has been established because of the uncertainty in their realization within the carryforward period.










Effective January 2012
 the Company adopted ASU No. 2011-04
 Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (ASU 2011-04). ASU 2011-04 represents the converged guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) on fair value measurement. A variety of measures are included in the update intended to either clarify existing fair value measurement requirements
 change particular principles requirements for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements. For many of the requirements
 the FASB does not intend to change the application of existing requirements under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820
 Fair Value Measurements. ASU 2011-04 was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15
 2011. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on the financial statements.




In February 2013
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02
 Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive (ASU 2013-02). This guidance is the culmination of the FASB&#8217;s deliberation on reporting reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). The amendments in ASU 2013-02 do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income. However
 the amendments require disclosure of amounts 


















reclassified out of AOCI in its entirety
 by component
 on the face of the statement of operations or in the notes thereto. Amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income must be cross-referenced to other disclosures that provide additional detail. This standard is effective prospectively for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2012. The Company is evaluating the effect
 if any
 the adoption of ASU 2013-02 will have on its financial statements.


In April 2013
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-07

 as well as any required disclosures. The amendments in this standard is effective prospectively for entities that determine liquidation is imminent during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2013
 and interim reporting periods therein. We are evaluating the effect
 if any
 adoption of ASU No. 2013-07 will have on our financial statements.&#160;&#160;

Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force)
 the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
 and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s present or future financial statements.

In July 2013
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11
 Income Taxes (Top 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward
 a Similar Tax Loss

 similar tax loss
 or tax credit carryforward exists. The amendments in this standard is effective for all entities that have unrecognized tax benefits when a net operating loss carryforward
 a similar tax loss
 or a tax credit carryforward exists for fiscal years
 and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2013. We are evaluating the effect
 if any
 adoption of ASU No. 2013-11 will have on our financial statements. &#160;







The Company has experienced losses since its inception October 4
 2010 of ($56
301).&#160;&#160;The Company has no business operations
 which raises substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern.&#160;&#160;The ability of the Company to meet its commitments as they become payable is dependent on the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing or achieving a profitable level of operations.&#160;&#160;There are no assurances the Company will be successful in achieving these goals.

The Company may not have sufficient cash to fund its operations and bring it into functionality.&#160;&#160;The Company has raised capital however this financing may be insufficient to fund expenditures or other cash requirements required to continue operations. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in developing profitable operations.&#160;&#160;The Company plans to seek additional financing if necessary in a private or public equity offering to secure future funding for operations. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in raising additional funding. If the Company is not able to secure additional funding
 the implementation of the Company&#8217;s business plan will be impaired. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all.







The Company is considered a development stage company
 with limited operating revenues during the periods presented
 as defined by FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 915.&#160;&#160;ASC 915 requires companies to report their operations
 shareholders deficit and cash flows since inception through the date that revenues are generated from management&#8217;s intended operations
 among other things.&#160;&#160;Management has 


















defined inception as October 4
 2010.&#160;&#160;Since inception
 the Company has incurred an operating loss of $56
301. The Company&#8217;s working capital has been generated through the sales of common stock and officer loans.&#160;&#160;Management has provided financial data since October 4
 2010 in the financial statements
 as a means to provide readers of the Company&#8217;s financial information to make informed investment decisions.





Net loss per share is calculated in accordance with FASB ASC 260
 Earnings Per Share
 for the period presented.&#160;&#160;Basic net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.&#160;&#160;Diluted net loss per share is based on the assumption that all dilative convertible shares and stock options were converted or exercised.&#160;&#160;Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method.&#160;&#160;Under this method
 options and warrants are assumed exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance
 if later)
 and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.

The Company has no potentially dilutive securities outstanding as of May 31
 2013.





There were no legal proceedings against the Company with respect to matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Neither the Company nor any of its officers or directors is involved in any other litigation
 or is involved either as plaintiffs or defendants
 and have no knowledge of any threatened or pending litigation against them or any of the officers or directors

As of May 31
 2013
 we had approximately $56
000 in net operating loss carryforwards which will expire in 2031 through 2033 if not first utilized.&#160;&#160;In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets
 management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.&#160;&#160;We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets
 the level of historical taxable income and tax planning strategies in making the assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets.&#160;&#160;We have identified the U.S. federal and Nevada as our major tax jurisdiction and generally
 we remain subject to Internal Revenue Service examination of our 2010 through 2012 U.S. federal income tax returns
 and remain subject to Nevada Department of Taxation for examination of our 2010 through 2012 California Franchise Tax Returns.

 our board engaged Anton &amp; Chia
 LLP (&#8220;

During our company&#8217;s most recent fiscal year and through the interim periods preceding the engagement of A&amp;C
 our company (a) has not engaged A&amp;C as either the principal accountant to audit our company&#8217;s financial statements
 or as an independent accountant to audit a significant subsidiary of our company and on whom the principal accountant is expected to express reliance in its report; and (b) has not consulted with A&amp;C regarding (i) the application of accounting principles to a specific transaction
 either completed or proposed
 or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our company&#8217;s financial statements
 and no written report or oral advice was provided to our company by A&amp;C concluding there was an important factor to be considered by our company in reaching a decision as to an accounting
 auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement
 as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(l)(iv) of Regulation S-K or a reportable event

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our principal executive and principal financial officer
 as appropriate
 to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures
 management recognizes that any controls and procedures
 no matter how well designed and operated
 can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives
 and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the controls and procedures would meet their objectives. As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b)
 our management carried out an evaluation
 with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officer
 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing
 our principal executive and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.



Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
 as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 management has conducted an assessment
 including testing
 using the criteria in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework
&#8221;). Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control-Integrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
 known as COSO
 to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this assessment
 management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31
 2013. This annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management&#8217;s report in this annual report.



There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal controls over financial reporting.



On June 4
 2013 we appointed Richenda Rowe as our Chief Executive Officer
 Chief Financial Officer and Director.

Also on June 4
 2013 Dennis Kjeldsen resigned as our Chief Executive Officer
 Chief Financial Officer and Director.&#160;&#160;The resignation was not as a result of any disagreement with our company operations
 policies or practices. Ms. Rowe is now our sole director and officer.

Richenda Rowe graduated in 2002 with a Double Diploma in Sports and Therapeutic Massage from Wellpark College of Natural Therapies in New Zealand. Ms. Rowe founded Real Balance Sport &amp; Remedial Massage in 2003
 a sports clinic located in Auckland
 NZ
 where she currently operates and works as a therapist.

As at the date of this report
 our directors and executive officers
 their ages
 positions held

 are as follows:






















President
 Chief Executive Officer

 Secretary and Director





June 4
 2013











Replaced Dennis Kjeldsen who resigned as a director and officer on June 4
 2013. Mr. Kjeldsen was first appointed a director and executive officer on October 4
 2010.








Richenda Rowe graduated in 2002 with a Double Diploma in Sports and Therapeutic Massage from Wellpark College of Natural Therapies in New Zealand. Ms. Rowe founded Real Balance Sport &amp; Remedial Massage in 2003
 a sports clinic located in Auckland
 NZ
 where she currently operates and works as a therapist.

















Our board&#8217;s primary responsibilities is be to supervise the management of our company
 to establish an appropriate corporate governance system
 and to set a tone of high professional and ethical standards.

adopting a code of conduct and a disclosure policy for our company
 and monitoring performance against those policies;



















approving any major changes to our company&#8217;s capital structure
 including significant investments or financing arrangements; and

Securities Exchange Act

 and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock
 to file reports regarding ownership of
 and transactions in
 our securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission and to provide us with copies of those filings.&#160;&#160;We believe that during the fiscal year ended May 31
 2013
 all filing requirements applicable to its officers
 directors and greater than 10% beneficial holders were complied with.



We have not yet adopted a code of ethics that applies to our principal executive officer
 principal financial officer
 principal accounting officer or controller or persons performing similar functions.






















As of the date of this annual report
 we did not effect any material changes to the procedures by which our shareholders may recommend nominees to our board of directors. Our board of directors does not have a policy with regards to the consideration of any director candidates recommended by our shareholders. Our board of directors has determined that it is in the best position to evaluate our company&#8217;s requirements as well as the qualifications of each candidate when the board considers a nominee for a position on our board of directors. If shareholders wish to recommend candidates directly to our board
 they may do so by sending communications to the president of our company at the address on the cover of this annual report.



In addition to having no nominating committee for this purpose
 we currently have no specific audit committee and no audit committee financial expert.&#160;&#160;Based on the fact that our current business affairs are simple
 any such committees are excessive and beyond the scope of our business and needs.

Our board of directors has determined that it does not have an audit committee member that qualifies as an &#8220;audit committee financial expert&#8221; as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. We believe that the audit committee is capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. In addition
 we believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an &#8220;audit committee financial expert&#8221; would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development and the fact that we have not generated revenues to date.





















our most highly compensated executive officers who were serving as executive officers at the end of the year ended May 31
 2013; and







up to two additional individuals for whom disclosure would have been provided under (b) but for the fact that the individual was not serving as our executive officer at the end of the most recently completed financial year
 who we will collectively refer to as the named executive officers
 for our years ended May&#160;31
 2013
 2012 and 2011
 are set out in the following summary compensation table:

There are no arrangements or plans in which we provide pension
 retirement or similar benefits for directors or executive officers. Our directors and executive officers may receive stock options at the discretion of our board of directors in the future. We do not have any material bonus or profit sharing plans pursuant to which cash or non-cash compensation is or may be paid to our directors or executive officers
 except that stock options may be granted at the discretion of our board of directors from time to time. We have no plans or arrangements in respect of remuneration received or that may be received by our executive officers to compensate such officers in the event of termination of employment (as a result of resignation
 retirement
 change of control) or a change of responsibilities following a change of control.



As at May 31
 2013
 we had not adopted any equity compensation plan and no stock
 options
 or other equity securities were awarded to our sole executive officer.

 2013 and Year End Option Values

766
698 shares of our common stock outstanding. The following table sets forth certain information known to us with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of that date by (i)&#160;each of our directors

 which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if
 for example
 persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition
 shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example
 upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person
