 the terms we, us, our, Lollipop, and &#8220;Issuer&#8221; mean Lollipop Corporation unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

























 2011
 we were incorporated in the State of Delaware and established a fiscal year end of December 31. The objective of this corporation is to distribute sports nutritional supplements
 especially in ring form capable of being worn during exercise
 including initially in Israel.




 including by participating in sports events such as triathlons and marathons. LPC believes that the concept behind our sports nutritional supplements is aligned with healthy lifestyle concerns as they assist athletes whilst in the midst of exercise or competition.


 and is a flourishing market. As an example
 in the United States
 research released in 2008 revealed that consumers are increasingly incorporating sports nutritional supplements into their lifestyles. We intend to create a fully functional website (www.lollipopsports.com) with updates as to healthy events to occur in Israel and in other territories as a way to attract individuals who also will choose to purchase our sports nutritional supplements. We have secured the web domain and the current website is a template of what we expect to further develop. The website is still under construction. The market has continued to grow but we have been unable to acquire the relevant resources to enter the market.&#160;




 but rather to have as yet unidentified third party suppliers from the Far-East and local partners at the point of distribution to deliver directly to our customers. We plan on establishing a commissioning policy for each supplier/partner. We expect that our suppliers will be able to deliver the sports nutritional products to our clients using their existing structure


 basketball and other sporting events
 running events and other public sports events
 including&#160;in the local large metropolitan areas such as Tel-Aviv and Haifa. We expect to also achieve some free &#8220;editorial&#8221; media coverage as these matches and the crowd is often covered by the evening news. We do not anticipate targeting high profile athletes.



























 brands are fighting for both shelf space and consumer attention. The wide range of choices in terms of flavor
 form
 size
 and price is encouraging consumers to shift from product to product
 trying out tastes and other benefits. As a result
 most participants in the sports/fitness nutrition industry - with the exception of the top ten companies
 which have strong product profiles - find themselves struggling to retain customer loyalty. Developing stronger brands with distinct identities and clear-cut positioning holds the key to overcome this challenge.


 particularly those which can be consumed during activity manufactured with key vitamins. Lollipop Corporation intends to penetrate this market using a strategy of attracting customers to buy its sports nutritional supplements by explaining the health and athletic benefits of a sports nutritional supplement. We have no arrangements in place with any of the companies identified as sports nutritional supplement suppliers.




 from which we expect to attract customers who are interested in purchasing sports nutritional supplements which will be available in ring and sucking candy form for consumption
 during or after their training or participation in sporting events.




 in due course
 subject to legal advice
 to apply for trademark protection and/or copyright protection in Israel and other jurisdictions. We intend to aggressively assert our rights trademark and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property
 including product design
 product research and concepts and recognized trademarks. These rights are protected through the acquisition of trademark registrations
 the maintenance of copyrights
 and
 where appropriate
 litigation against those who are
 in our opinion
 infringing these rights.





















 we intend to assert our intellectual property rights against any infringer. Although any assertion of our rights can result in a substantial cost to
 and diversion of effort by
 our Company
 management believes that the protection of our intellectual property rights is a key component of our operating strategy.




 we still need to verify certifications and possible government approvals needed to execute our business. We are subject to the laws and regulations of those jurisdictions in which we plan to sell our product
 which are generally applicable to business operations
 such as business licensing requirements
 income taxes and payroll taxes. In general
 the development and operation of our business is not subject to special regulatory and/or supervisory requirements.

 it will hire an independent consultant for the further development and finalization of the site. The Company also intends to hire sales representatives initially on a commission only basis to keep administrative overhead to a minimum.




























IF A MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK DOES NOT DEVELOP
 SHAREHOLDERS MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL THEIR SHARES


 our shares may never be traded on the bulletin board
 or
 if traded
 a public market may not materialize. If our common stock is not traded on the bulletin board or if a public market for our common stock does not develop
 investors may not be able to re-sell the shares of our common stock that they have purchased and may lose all of their investment.

BECAUSE OUR AUDITORS HAVE ISSUED A GOING CONCERN OPINION REGARDING OUR COMPANY
 THERE IS A RISK ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTING IN OUR BUSINESS


 as we do not have material assets
 nor do we have operations or a source of revenue sufficient to cover our operation costs. The Company has a net operating loss accumulated since inception (November 17
 2011) through December 31
 2013. The Company will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital through placement of our common stock in order to implement its business operations
 or merge with an operating company.




 these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts
 or amount and classification of liabilities that might cause results from this uncertainty.


 our auditors stated in their report that they have substantial doubt we will be able to continue as a going concern. As a result
 there is an increased risk that you could lose the entire amount of your investment in our company.




















THE COMPANY&#8217;S MANAGEMENT COULD ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES
 SINCE THE COMPANY HAS 180
000
000 AUTHORIZED SHARES
 DILLUTING THE CURRENT SHARE HOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY


000
000 authorized shares
 of which only 1
032
428 are currently issued and outstanding. The company&#8217;s management could
 without the consent of the existing shareholders
 issue substantially more shares
 causing a large dilution in the equity position of the company&#8217;s current shareholders. Additionally
 large share issuances would generally have a negative impact on the company&#8217;s share price. It is possible that
 due to additional share issuance
 you could lose a substantial amount
 or all
 of your investment.

IN THE EVENT THAT OUR SHARES ARE TRADED
 THEY MAY TRADE UNDER $5.00 PER SHARE AND THUS WILL BE A PENNY STOCK. TRADING IN PENNY STOCKS HAS MANY RESTRICTIONS AND THESE RESTRICTIONS COULD SEVERLY AFFECT THE PRICE AND LIQUIDITY OF OUR SHARES


 and our stock trades below $5.00 per share
 our stock would be known as a &#8220;penny stock&#8221;
 which is subject to various regulations involving disclosures to be given to you prior to the purchase of any penny stock. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) has adopted regulations which generally define a &#8220;penny stock&#8221; to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share
 subject to certain exceptions. Depending on market fluctuations
 our common stock could be considered to be a &#8220;penny stock&#8221;. A penny stock is subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by these rules
 the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of these securities. In addition
 he must receive the purchaser&#8217;s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. He must also provide certain written disclosures to the purchaser. Consequently
 the &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities
 and may negatively affect the ability of holders of shares of our common stock to resell them. These disclosures require you to acknowledge that you understand the risks associated with buying penny stocks and that you can absorb the loss of your entire investment. Penny stocks are low priced securities that do not have a very high trading volume. Consequently
 the price of the stock is often volatile and you may not be able to buy or sell the stock when you want to.

SINCE OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CURRENTLY OWN 84% OF THE OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK
 INVESTORS MAY FIND THAT THEIR DECISIONS ARE CONTRARY TO THEIR INTERESTS


 own 84% of the outstanding shares. Accordingly
 they will have full control in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters
 including mergers
 consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets
 and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control. While we have no current plans with regard to any merger
 consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets
 the interests of our officers and directors may still differ from the interests of the other stockholders.


 no person should purchase our shares unless willing to entrust all aspects of management to the Officers and Directors
 or their successors. Potential purchasers of our shares must carefully evaluate the personal experience and business abilities of our management.




















SINCE WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY
 WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING DIVIDENDS IN THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE AND AS SUCH OUR STOCKHOLDERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECEIVE A RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT UNLESS THEY SELL THEIR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK


 but plan rather to retain earnings
 if any
 for growth and expansion of our business. Unless we pay dividends
 our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them. There is no assurance that stockholders will be able to sell shares when desired.&#160;

IT MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO HIRE ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCED PROFESSIONALS
 IF NECESSARY
 AND WE MAY HAVE TO SUSPEND OR CEASE OPERATIONS


 we may need to hire additional experienced personnel to assist us with the operations. If we need the additional experienced personnel and we cannot hire them
 we could fail in our plan of operations and have to suspend operations or cease them entirely.


 as planned
 we anticipate the need of contracting nutritionists to help us in the development of sports nutritional supplements and information concerning the distribution of such sports nutritional products
 as our Officers and Directors have limited experience in this field. If we do not succeed in finding
 contracting or retaining skilled nutritionists and sports enthusiasts
 an important part of our business will be affected
 which may lead to the suspension of our operation or the cession of it completely.




 our operation would be affected. Therefore
 our operation
 revenue and financial success could be severely affected
 resulting in the suspension of our operation or the cession of it completely.

BECAUSE OUR MANAGEMENT IS INEXPERIENCED IN OPERATING A SPORTS NUTRITION DISTRIBUTION NETWORK
 OUR BUSINESS PLAN MAY FAIL


 our management may not be fully aware of many of the specific requirements related to working within this industry. As a result
 our management may lack certain skills that are advantageous in managing our company. Consequently
 our operations
 earnings
 and ultimate financial success could suffer irreparable harm due to management&#8217;s lack of experience in this industry.




















THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS NO SPORTS NUTRITIONAL PRODUCTS. WHEN WE DO HAVE SPORTS NUTRITIONAL PRODUCTS OUR NAME WILL HAVE LITTLE
 IF ANY
 NAME RECOGNITION. AS A RESULT
 WE MAY BE UNABLE TO GENERATE REVENUES
 WHICH WILL REDUCE THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT


 there is little or no recognition of our name. As a result
 consumers may search for sports nutritional products other than ours that have brand recognition in the market and we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to meet our expenses or meet our business plan objectives
 which will reduce the value of your investment.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT&#8217;S COMMON EQUITY
 RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES




 we are currently engaging a market maker to file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;) to have our common stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board.




 2015
 there were 42 registered stockholders holding 1
032
428 common shares issued and outstanding.




 we have not declared nor paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our current policy is to retain any earnings in order to finance our operations. Our Board of Directors will determine future declarations and payments of dividends
 if any
 in light of the then-current conditions it deems relevant and in accordance with applicable corporate law.












 2014
 neither we nor any &#8220;affiliated purchaser
&#8221; as that term is defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act
 repurchased any of our common stock or other securities.



























 incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 17
 2011
 as a for-profit company
 and an established fiscal year of December 31. We have not yet generated or realized any revenues from business operations. Our auditor has issued a going concerned opinion. This means there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve (12) months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. Accordingly
 we must raise cash from sources other than our operations and our share sale pursuant to the registration statement in order to implement our marketing plan. In our management&#8217;s opinion
 there is a market for a reasonably-priced sports nutritional supplements.


 2013.


 2014
 our business operations have primarily been focused on developing our business and researching the market. Through December 31
 2014
 we have spent $59
012 related to corporate operations
 registration of our shares and ordinary business expenses. We have not generated any revenue from business operations. All cash currently held by us is the result of the sale of common stock to our directors and officers and sales pursuant to our public offering.


 2011
 the Corporation issued 875
000 shares of common stock to the two directors of the Corporation at a price of $0.016 per share
 for $14
000
 for initial capital (stock subscription receivable). The proceeds from this stock issuance were received on November 14
 2012.


 2013
 the Corporation issued 157
428 registered shares of our common stock according to our effective registration statement at a price of $0.25 per share
 for $39
357.&#160;


 we have not yet fully implemented our business plan. We expect to continue to conduct market research. We also expect to finalize our web-site once we have raised additional funds.


 our company needs to accomplish the steps described above
 in order to have a better understanding of the Market and then establish our Marketing strategies. Our company believes that the success of our business relies on the proper execution of the above described plan of operation.


 which would allow us to possibly always have a supplier nearby our clients
 resulting in faster delivery and fresher ingredients. We plan on establishing a commissioning policy for each supplier/partner. We expect that our suppliers will be able to deliver the products to our clients using their existing structure. If one or all of our suppliers can&#8217;t provide delivery service
 we would have to hire a third party delivery company and
 in this case
 we would charge a delivery fee to our clients. In order to keep the delivery cost down
 we intend to seek for several clients who live in the same area
 so
 more deliveries would be made at each time.




 2014
 we had no revenue. Expenses for the period totaled $32
539 resulting in a net loss of $32
539 for the period. For the twelve months period ending December 31
 2013 we had no revenue and operating expenses of $26
431. Since inception (November 17
 2011) through December 31
 2014 we have had no revenue and total expenses of $59
012.


 2014 are mostly associated with professional fees
 start-up costs and filing fees.&#160;























 2014 we had&#160;total assets in the form of cash and&#160;cash equivalents&#160;in the amount of&#160;$4
353 and current liabilities in the amount of $10
008.


 meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from our intended offering and implemented our plan of operations. Our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in our effective registration statement. We must raise additional cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. In the event of the failure to complete our financing we would need to seek capital from other resources such as debt financing
 which may not even be available to us.


 we will generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof. However
 additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all
 and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements.




 due to the fact that we have not implemented our business plan and have not generated any revenues yet
 it is important to keep the focus on our business plan before starting researching for new products and services
 depending on the results of our plan of operation We also do not expect any significant additions to the number of employees
 as the company intends to hire third party consultants when necessary.


 Yisrael Meir Fromer and our Secretary Malka Dahan-Asulin have indicated at this time that they may be willing to provide funds required to maintain the reporting status in the form of a non-secured loan for the next twelve months as the expenses are incurred if no other proceeds are obtained by the Company. However
 there is no contract in place or written agreement securing this agreement. Management believes if the Company cannot maintain its reporting status with the SEC it will have to cease all efforts directed towards the Company. As such
 any investment previously made would be lost in its entirety.

 2014
 the Company has a loss from operations of $32

 &#8220;Income Taxes.&#8221; Under the asset and liability method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (temporary differences). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.




 Earnings Per Share ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the effects of all potential dilutive common shares
 which comprise options granted to employees. As at December 31
 2014
 the Company had no potentially dilutive shares.




 which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability
 as the case may be
 in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such
 fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs
 used in valuation techniques
 are assigned a hierarchical level.

 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update &#8220;ASU&#8221; 2014-15 on &#8220;Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) - Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&#8221;. Currently
 there is no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so
 the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically
 the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management's plans
 (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated
 and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). We do not believe that the adoption of the provisions of this ASU will have any impact on our results of operations

 &amp;#34;Earnings Per Share&amp;#34; ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share&#13;(&amp;#147;EPS&amp;#148;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to&#13;common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is&#13;determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders and the weighted average number of common shares&#13;outstanding for the effects of all potential dilutive common shares
 which comprise options granted to employees. As at December&#13;31

 the Financial Accounting Standards&#13;Board (&amp;#147;FASB&amp;#148;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&amp;#147;ASU&amp;#148;) No. 2014-10&amp;#151;Development Stage Entities&#13;(Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
 Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance&#13;in Topic 810
 Consolidation. ASU 2014-10 eliminates several of the reporting requirements for development stage entities
 including&#13;the requirement to present inception to date information in the statements of income
 cash flows
 and shareholder equity
 and to&#13;label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity. ASU 2014-10 also clarifies that the guidance in Accounting&#13;Standards Codification (&amp;#34;ASC&amp;#34;) Topic 275
 &amp;#34;Risks and Uncertainties&amp;#34;
 is applicable to entities that have not&#13;commenced principal operations
 and eliminates an exception to the sufficiency-of-equity risk criterion for development stage entities
&#13;and will require all reporting entities that have an interest in development stage enterprises to apply consistent consolidation&#13;guidance for variable interest entities. ASU 2014-10 is effective for all annual reporting periods beginning after December 15

 the FASB issued Accounting&#13;Standards Update &amp;#147;ASU&amp;#148; 2014-15 on &amp;#147;Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) - Disclosure&#13;of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&amp;#148;. Currently
 there is no guidance in U.S. GAAP&#13;about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going&#13;concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so
 the amendments&#13;are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess&#13;an entity's ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in&#13;U.S. auditing standards. Specifically
 the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation&#13;every reporting period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's&#13;plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management's plans
&#13;(5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated
 and (6) require an assessment&#13;for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). We do not believe&#13;that the adoption of the provisions of this ASU will have any impact on our results of operations
