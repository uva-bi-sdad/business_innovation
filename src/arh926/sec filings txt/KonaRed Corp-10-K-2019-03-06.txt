Operations
 Facilities and Distribution Method for Our Products


500 square foot facility located in Carlsbad
 California. We use an outsourcing business model based on utilizing third parties for the bulk of our non-core business operations
 such as manufacturing and coffee fruit extraction and retail products
 while maintaining in-house control of critical marketing
 product development and warehousing/shipping functions. We are transitioning to in-house bottling.




 Hawaii.


 we have an exclusive arrangement for the supply of raw coffee fruit from Greenwell Farms
 Inc.
 a Hawaii corporation with a long established history as a major Hawaiian coffee supplier.


 such raw material has also remained readily available from coffee farms located in Hawaii and internationally. Therefore
 although we currently have a principal supplier
 in the event that we lose this supplier
 we are confident that we would be able to secure raw material from other suppliers
 both in Hawaii and other locations.


 shipping the dried coffee fruit to our Carlsbad warehouse for storage
 and then subsequently sending required quantities to subcontractors for value-added processing. The value-added processing consists of water based extraction whereby the dried coffee fruit is reduced to liquid extract.


 our antioxidant beverages are processed by us sending processed coffee fruit to a 3rd party flavor house which makes the KonaRed concentrate and then ships it to our company&rsquo;s bottling vendors. Notably
 we own the proprietary beverage formulas. Pallets of the ready-to-drink product items are then shipped back to our company&rsquo;s warehouse
 or third party inventory transit service providers
 and disseminated to either distributors
 or shipped directly to retailers.













 boasting numerous retail entrees and continued expansion. We first established our products in the upstart coffee fruit sector on our home turf in Hawaii and then have expanded across the USA by winning placements at Kroger
 Target
 Vitamin Shoppe and other major retailers. We have since moved into the large and lucrative market of coffee and have expanded beyond just coffee fruit. Over 50% of Americans over the age of 18 drink coffee daily and it is a huge marketplace. We have positioned ourselves as one of the leading RTD Cold Brew Coffee product lines on the market since our February 2016 launch. We continued to expand on these markets throughout 2017.




 California. We have a direct sales team of three individuals
 two in Hawaii and one in Southern California whose main job is to secure new customers directly in person. We have also retained manufacturers&rsquo; sales representatives who work to increase our overall sales efforts in specific regions such as New York
 Los Angeles and Florida. In early 2017 we signed a brokerage agreement with Impact Sale Group to represent our entire line of products to the conventional and natural sales channels in the Western United States.


 merchandising follow-up
 dialog with store managers
 and coordination of promotions and pricing are critical in maintaining brand momentum. We anticipate adding sales staff to meet demand as we grow.


 we believe consumer acceptance of our beverage products now places us both within the coffee and &lsquo;premium juice&rsquo; retail categories
 as well as on dairy shelves with cold brew coffees
 and the coffee aisle with our whole bean coffee line.

 beverage and nutritional products. We plan to achieve this using a strategy of expanding our retail footprint through a series of revenue generating distribution channels as well as direct to consumer sales.

 such as juices
 beer
 and water
 which they sell to retail stores and other wholesalers. DSD is a business process that manufacturers use to both sell and distribute goods directly to point of sales or point of consumption including additional product and market related services such as merchandising.&nbsp; In order to fulfill growing demand from retailers
 DSDs specializing in the beverage channels are expanding their functional beverage categories to include the type of products in which KonaRed specializes. (A &lsquo;functional beverage&rsquo;&nbsp;is defined as one which has certain attributes
 such as Antioxidants.)

Growth of our retail footprint will continue to be evaluated through the growth of our client base in each specific distribution channel. We will also be launching new products when the timing makes sense for the company and the market dynamics.




 packaging
 development of new products and flavors
 and marketing campaigns. Our product is competing directly with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers. Most of these brands have enjoyed broad
 well-established national recognition for years
 through well-funded ad and other marketing campaigns. In addition
 companies manufacturing these products generally have far greater financial
 marketing
 and distribution resources than we do. We compete to secure distributors who will agree to market our product over those of our competitors
 provide stable and reliable distribution
 and secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments
 including numerous specialty beverages.


 trade and consumer promotions
 the development of new
 unique and cutting edge products
 attractive and unique packaging
 branded product advertising
 pricing
 and the success of our distribution network. We believe our branding is strong and our position as a U.S. coffee supplier is relatively unique. We are committed to ethical production of our source ingredients and our use of a previously discarded by-product of coffee represents our environmentally positive corporate operating philosophy. We are also non-GMO. We believe these factors combine to provide us with a competitive advantage and our products are consistently well received by consumers.

 2017
 the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors elected Gregory Willsey to the Board of Directors for a &ldquo;Series A Director&rdquo; seat.&nbsp; He is the Manager&nbsp;of the Series A Investors
 and his election was a condition to the closing of the Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement.


 2017
 the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors adopted a 2017 Equity Incentive Plan covering 36
737
032 shares of Common Stock and a 2017 Series B Equity Incentive Plan covering 88 shares of Series B Preferred Stock.&nbsp; Each Plan authorizes incentive and nonqualified stock options
 restricted stock
 restricted stock units
 stock appreciation rights
 etc. (In 2018
 the 2017 Series B Equity Incentive Plan was enlarged to cover 280 shares of Series B Preferred Stock.)

condition to the closing of the Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement that the Company &ldquo;go dark&rdquo; (terminate the registration of its Common Stock class under the Securities Exchange Act and suspend its Securities Exchange Act and Securities Act reporting obligations).&nbsp; Accordingly
 on October 24
 2017 the Company filed a Form 15 with the SEC.&nbsp; The effect of this filing was to
 90 days thereafter (January 22
 2018) terminate the registration of the Company&rsquo;s Common Stock class under the Securities Exchange Act; accordingly
&nbsp;day
 none of the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act which are applicable to &ldquo;public companies&rdquo; and their directors
 officers and 10% stockholders will apply to the Company and its directors
 officers and 10% stockholders.&nbsp; However
 the Company&rsquo;s obligations to file periodic and current reports (Forms 10-K
 10-Q and 8-K) with the SEC persisted until suspended as described in the next sentence.&nbsp; The Company&rsquo;s obligations to file periodic and current reports with the SEC were not suspended for the remainder of 2017 (so
 this final Form 10-K annual report must be filed)
 but they were suspended for 2018 and future years provided that the Company has no Securities Act registration statements effective during such years.&nbsp; The Company amended all its open Securities Act registration statements before December 31
 2017 in order to deregister all remaining unsold shares under such open Securities Act registration statements
 thereby ensuring that the Company&rsquo;s obligations to file periodic and current reports with the SEC will be suspended for 2018 and future years.&nbsp; Therefore the Company is not required to file any other Form 10-K
 10-Q or 8-K after December 31
 2017
 other than this final 2017 Form 10-K report.


&rdquo; public trading in its stock becomes much more difficult
 and publicly trading would typically become illiquid and sporadic.&nbsp; The Company&rsquo;s stock is able to be publicly traded only on OTC Markets Group&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pink&rdquo; trading level
 the OTCPK market.&nbsp; The Company has ceased to be legally required to provide (and would elect not to voluntarily provide) &ldquo;current public information&rdquo; such as would facilitate investor interest and Rule 144 trading eligibility.&nbsp; (Thus
 the phrase &ldquo;going dark.&rdquo;&nbsp; Although the Company has ceased to be a &ldquo;public company
&rdquo; references to the process described here as being a &ldquo;going private&rdquo; process would not be technically correct because &ldquo;going private&rdquo; means instead that a formerly-public company has been acquired.)




 even after the Company &ldquo;went dark&rdquo; and is no longer a &ldquo;public company
&rdquo; they remain Company shareholders
 and holders of Company equity
 for their same number of shares of Company Common Stock.

 LLC (&ldquo;Circleup&rdquo;). The credit facility allows for a loan of $250

 cost as determined on an average basis
 or market.&nbsp;Market value is determined by reference to selling prices at
 or around
 balance sheet date or by management&rsquo;s estimates based on prevailing market conditions. Management writes down the inventories to market value if below cost. Management also regularly evaluates the composition of its inventories to identify slow-moving and obsolete inventories to determine if a valuation allowance is required. Costs of raw material and finished goods inventories include purchase and related costs incurred in bringing the products to their present location and condition.

 a sizable component of Cold Brew Coffee sales growth has been from repeat customers. Cold Brew is now KonaRed&#39;s major marketing focus and consumer demand drove expansion of our Cold Brew Coffee line from 3 to 5 products in August 2017 with the addition of &ldquo;Maui Mocha&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kauai Caramel&rdquo; flavors. We expect this trend to continue as we invest more time and resources into the Cold Brew Coffee product lines
 including the addition of our 32oz bottles.


 2016 and for the period ended December 31
 2017 this product line accounted for 84% of our sales. During the last quarter of 2017 Cold Brew Coffee sales comprised 80% of our product sales.









 Cold Brew Coffee is a booming new market sector and KonaRed has emerged early as a leader in this new category. The Cold Brewed Coffee industry earned total revenues over $65 million in 2017.


 2017 and now appear on major retail shelves throughout the United States.




 in 2016 and 2017 our production was based on an outsourcing business model which utilizes third parties for the bulk of our non-core business operations
 such as coffee fruit extraction and product manufacturing. The main component of our cost of goods sold (&ldquo;COGS&rdquo;) relates to costing the finished goods which are drawn from our inventory when sold. These finished goods primarily include bottles of different types of our coffee beverages in various container and lot sizes which have been manufactured in a staged process for us by third parties. Costing is done by applying specific unit sales to unit product costs based on the costs per unit recorded in our inventory system. Costs per unit in the inventory system include per unit manufacturing charges from outsource manufacturers.


 COGS also includes expensing of adjustments for shrinkage during production runs and inventory which has been disposed of because it has expired and/or become obsolete
 or been subject to a write-down reserve because the inventory has been deemed to be potentially useful
 but has been slow moving for a significant period of time. During the years ended December 31
 2017 and December 31
 2016
 these expenses respectively totaled $97
298 and $24
769. At December 31
 2017 and December 31
 2016 we had no reserves of outdated inventory.


 2017 and December 31
 2016
 COGS were $2
339
159 and $740
806
 or 81% and 70% of sales. This corresponds to gross margin percentages of 19% and 30%. We project total COGS will increase in 2018 and 2019 and gross margin will improve as order flow increases and we begin to benefit from in-house bottling (to which we intend to transition in the first half of 2019)
 less expensive shipping costs and the economies of scale of larger production runs.


 2017 and December 31
 2016 included: (i) manufacturing costs
 which include both in-house and outsourced manufacturing costs and inventory adjustments
 which totaled $2
108
794 versus $692
920
 respectively; (ii) inventory delivery which totaled $174
420 versus $33
816
 respectively; (iii) term discounts which totaled $39

 respectively.












786 and $5
320
 respectively for years ended December 31
 2017 and December 31
 2016
 respectively

973 for the year ended December 31
 2017
 compared with $276
299 for the year ended December 31
 2016

461 versus $9
945
 representing an increase of 2640%; (iii) website expenses were $30

 representing an increase of 175%; and (v) tradeshows
 sponsorships
 public relations initiatives
 and other marketing expenses totaled $144
885 versus $122
022
 representing an increase of 19%. We project advertising and marketing costs will increase in 2018 and 2019.

872 for the year ended December 31
 2017 compared to and $2
692
774 for the year ended December 31
 2016
 representing an increase of 23%. G&amp;A costs include cash and non-cash expenses. Non-cash expenses include stock based compensation expenses
 stock issued for services
 patent license fees
 and depreciation expenses. G&amp;A costs were more heavily weighted toward non-cash expenses in 2016; for the years ended December 31
 2017 and December 31
 2016
 G&amp;A cash expenses comprised $2
975
396 and $1
655
947; and non-cash expenses comprised $381
476 and $1
036
827.




 2017 and December 31
 2016 included: (i) payroll of $1
410
420 versus $952
427
 representing an increase of 48%
 which is attributable to an increased staff count; (ii) customer shipping expenses of $281
255 versus $124
760
 representing an increase of 125%
 which is attributable to increased sales volume; and (iii) professional and consultant fees of $337
239 versus $109
142
 representing an increase of 209%

 2017 and December 31
 2016 included: (i) stock issued for compensation of $216
843 versus $405
373
 representing a decrease of 47%
 which is attributable to less offerings to executive staff of shares in lieu of cash for a portion of their remuneration; (ii) stock issued for services of $145
287 versus $254
009
 representing a decrease of 43%
 which is attributable to the decreased use of consultants; and (iii) patent license fees of $15
320 versus $375
000
 representing a decrease of 96%
 which is attributable to the scheduled decreases in the VDF License Agreement.




 2017 and December 31
 2016
 other income (expense) respectively totaled $(10
621
582) versus $(644
826). The largest items within Other income (expense) for the years ended December 31
 2017 and December 31
 2016 were (i) non-cash income (expense) for the fair market value of a derivative liability of $(9
016

522) in 2017
 versus $(472
510) in 2016. The most significant derivative liability to which the 2017 item related was a result of the various warrants issued to the purchasers of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock as part of the October 24
 2017 financing transaction.




 2017 versus December 31
 2016 were $13
926
649
 or $0.09 per share
 versus $3
300

 2017 we raised a total of $3
990
568 through sales of equity. This was comprised of: (a) $431
468 raised from private placement sales of 7
844
874 restricted common shares at $0.055 per share; (b) $15
000 through a private placement remedial Unit Offer #3 sale of 375

554 Series A Preferred shares and 35 Series B Preferred shares (in addition to issuances of other Series A Preferred shares and Series B Preferred shares in exchange for outstanding debt); and (g) $491
600 for warrants exercised for common shares.&nbsp; Although in the past it has been necessary for us to raise cash in numerous offerings in order to maintain ourselves
 this practice resulted in a drain on management&rsquo;s bandwidth and often required us to accept unduly dilutive provisions.&nbsp; We expect that in the foreseeable future we will not be engaging in a similarly numerous set of financings
 and that as our business improves we will be in a better position to obtain further financing (when and if needed) on favorable terms.


 2016 we raised: (a) $666

 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits

 the Company has suffered a net loss from operations and has a net capital deficiency

 and packaging materials. Our finished goods inventory process begins when we take possession of dried coffee fruit from coffee growers in Hawaii. We then ship the raw material to our California warehouse for storage and then send required quantities to subcontractors for value-added processing; or we ship the raw materials directly from Hawaii to the processors. For our beverage products which include coffee fruit
 value-added processing then occurs whereby the dried coffee fruit is converted to liquid extract through water based extraction. The extracts are then shipped from the raw materials processors to our California warehouse or directly to our bottling contractors. The bottling contractors then add our proprietary extract to other ingredients to produce our finished goods. Our cold brew coffee is manufactured using a comparable process. Finished goods are shipped back to either our Company&rsquo;s warehouse or third party transit agents and subsequently disseminated to either distributors or shipped directly to retailers. The process for production of our nutritional wellness products follows a similar manufacturing chain

 balance sheet date or by management&rsquo;s estimates based on prevailing market conditions. Management writes down the inventories to market value if it is below cost. Management also regularly evaluates the composition of its inventories to identify slow-moving and obsolete inventories to determine if a valuation allowance is required. If a valuation allowance is required
 an offsetting entry is made which expenses the reserved inventory to cost of goods sold during the period in which the valuation was required. Subsequently
 if this reserved inventory is used in future periods
 an offset is entered to cost of goods sold which decreases cost of goods sold during that subsequent period. Costs of raw material and finished goods inventories include purchase and related costs incurred in bringing the products to their present location and condition. Labor

 the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method
 deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that
 based on available evidence
 are not expected to be realized.


 the Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold
 the amount recognized in these financial statements is the benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.

 net of a discount of $16
786. The Company determined the VDF Note had an embedded derivative valued at $11
649 at December 31
 2016 due to Sr. Note One having a provision which required adjustments to the conversion price to compensate for dilutive stock issuance events unrelated to the VDF Note. During the period ended December 31
 2016
 $417
188 of principal was added to the VDF Note. This was comprised of $375
000 of patent license fees which were rolled over to the VDF Note and accrued interest for the year ended December 31
 2016 of $42
188. On September 29
 2017
 the Company and VDF signed an amendment to the Senior Convertible Note. Per the amendment
 the companies agreed that the total new outstanding balance was $916
457
 and that VDF immediately converted all of the debt into equity of common shares at a conversion price of $0.07 per share
 resulting in 13

ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (&ldquo;EPS&rdquo;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including stock warrants and options
 using the treasury stock method; and convertible preferred stock and convertible debt using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS
 the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.&nbsp;The Company currently has options
 warrants and convertible debt outstanding
 and no convertible preferred stock has been issued. Common stock equivalents pertaining to the options
 warrants and convertible debt were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per common share in these financial statements because the effect would have been anti-dilutive due to the net losses&nbsp;for the years ended December 31

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&ldquo;ASU&rdquo;) No. 2016-15 &ldquo;Statement of Cash Flows&rdquo; (Topic 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments because stakeholders had indicated that there is diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230
 Statement of Cash Flows
 and other Topics. This Update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The amendments in this Update apply to all entities
 including both business entities and not-for-profit entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows under Topic 230. Among the eight issues
 there were two which appeared germane to the Company: (i) 
 which provided guidance that Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities; and (ii) 
 which provided guidance that the classification of cash receipts and payments that have aspects of more than one class of cash flows should be determined first by applying specific guidance in generally accepted accounting principles. In the absence of specific guidance
 an entity should determine each separately identifiable source or use within the cash receipts and cash payments on the basis of the nature of the underlying cash flows. An entity should then classify each separately identifiable source or use within the cash receipts and payments on the basis of their nature in financing
 investing
 or operating activities. In situations in which cash receipts and payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows and cannot be separated by source or use
 the appropriate classification should depend on the activity that is likely to be the predominant source or use of cash flows for the item.


 2017
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities
 the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019. Early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period
 any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. This ASU conforms with the Company&rsquo;s current protocols and the Company expects to adopt this ASU once it becomes effective. The Company does not expect the adoption of the ASU to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.


 FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10 &ldquo;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&rdquo; (Topic 606). This follows the May 28
 2014
 FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issuance of a converged standard on recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The amendments in this Update affect entities with transactions included within the scope of Topic 606. The scope of that Topic includes entities that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services (that are an output of the entity&rsquo;s ordinary activities) in exchange for consideration. The core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in this Update affect the guidance in Accounting Standards Update 2014-09

 which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Since inception
 the Company has incurred losses totaling $37
308
866 as of December 31
 2017 and has incurred a net loss for the current year of $13
926
649. These factors
 among others
 raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. As needed
 the Company will pursue additional equity and/or debt financing while managing cash flows from operations in an effort to provide funds to meet its obligations on a timely basis and to support future business development. The financial statements do not contain any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. To address these issues
 during the year ended December 31
 2017
 the Company raised $1

968 from private placement equity offerings
 $491

 2015
 subject to securities purchase agreements we issued two subordinated promissory notes (&ldquo;September 2015 Note One&rdquo; and &ldquo;September 2015 Note Two&rdquo;
 collectively
 the &ldquo;September 2015 Notes&rdquo;) to two lenders (the &ldquo;September 2015 Lenders&rdquo;). The September 2015 Notes provided for customary events of default such as failing to timely make payments and the occurrence of certain fundamental defaults
 as described in the September 2015 Notes. The September 2015 Notes were not secured and are subordinated to senior notes issued by the Company. September 2015 Note One had a face value of $100
000 and September 2015 Note Two had a face value of $150
000. The interest rate on each note was 8% per annum and this amount fully accrued upon issuance and added $8
000 to September 2015 Note One and $12
000 to September 2015 Note Two to bring the total balances due on each note to $108
000 and $162
000
 respectively. The September 2015 Notes each included a 10% original issuance discount (&ldquo;OID&rdquo;) which resulted in total net proceeds to the Company of $225
000. As an inducement for the loans
 On September 30
 2015 the September 2015 Lenders received five-year warrants
 with cashless exercise rights
 to purchase&nbsp;restricted shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.08 per share. September 2015 Note One Lender received 1
250
000 warrants which were valued using a Black-Scholes model at $67
115; and September 2015 Note Two Lender received 1
875
000 warrants which were valued using a Black-Scholes model at non-cash cost of $100
673.


 2016
 the balance on September 2015 Note One was $nil. During the year ended December 31
 2016
 the Company timely met a series of scheduled cash payments on September 2015 Note One totaling $49
000 and on August 30
 2016 redeemed the balance of $59
000 due through issuance of 1
475
000 shares valued at $95
875 based on a market close price of $0.065 per share on date of issuance. The $36
875 difference between the cash redemption balance and the value of the shares redemption was treated as a conversion loss and recorded as an additional non-cash interest expense. At time of redemption on August 30
 2016 the remaining $50
245 of the warrant discount on September 2015 Note One was recorded as an amortization expense and the remaining $7
486 OID was recorded as interest expense.


 2017
 the holder of September 2015 Note Two converted the remaining balance of $65
000 due on the note into 1
625
000 shares valued at $128
463 based on a market close prices on dates of issuance. The conversions resulted in a $63
463 difference between the cash redemption balance and the value of the shares redemption which was treated as a conversion loss and recorded as an additional non-cash interest expense. Concurrent with the conversions
 the remaining $16
527 of the warrant discount on September 2015 Note Two was recorded as an amortization expense and the remaining $8
062 OID was recorded as interest expense.


 2016
 the balance on September 2015 Note Two was $40
411. This included the remaining face value and accrued interest totaling $65
000
 net of an unamortized warrant and beneficial conversion feature (&ldquo;BCF&rdquo;) discounts of $16
527 and an unamortized OID discount of $8
062. During the year ended December 31
 2016
 the Company timely met a series of scheduled cash payments on September 2015 Note One totaling $88
500 and
 prior to scheduled redemption date
 on September 23
 2016 the original lender extended the maturity date of the note to November 14
 2016 in exchange for the right to convert the balance of $73
500 into common shares of the Company at a price of $0.04 per share. On September 23
 2016 the Company&rsquo;s closing share price was $0.0605 and this created a BCF which was valued at $37
669. On November 7
 2016
 prior to scheduled redemption date
 the $73
500 balance due on September 2015 Note Two was purchased by the September 2015 Note One Lender (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;September 2015 Note Two Purchaser&rdquo;) from the original lender. Also on November 7
 2016
 in return for the addition of $11
500 to the OID for September 2015 Note Two
 the September 2015 Note Two Purchaser extended the maturity of September 2015 Note Two to August 7
 2017 based on the Company meeting a payment schedule of $40
000 on May 7
 2017 and $45
000 on August 7
 2017. The $11
500 addition to the OID increased the principal due on September 2015 Note Two to $85
000.


 the transaction resulted in a conversion loss of $6
850 which was the difference between the cash redemption balance and the value of the shares issued for redemption and was recorded as an additional non-cash interest expense. During the year ended December 31
 2016
 a total of $96
509 of the warrant and BCF discounts were recorded as an amortization expense and $14
668 amortization of the OID was recorded as interest expense. September 2015 Note Two was fully satisfied by conversion into common stock in January 2017.&nbsp; At September 30
 2017
 the balances on the September 2015 Notes were $nil.










 2015
 subject to a securities purchase agreement we issued a subordinated promissory note (the &ldquo;December 2015 Note&rdquo;) to one lender (the &ldquo;December 2015 Lender&rdquo;) in the aggregate amount of $110
000 (the &ldquo;Original Principal&rdquo;). The December 2015 Note bears interest at 8% per annum and this amount fully accrued upon execution of the loan and added $8
800 to the balance due at issuance date. The principal and interest was due and payable in full on December 3
 2016 (&ldquo;Maturity Date&rdquo;) and had a re-payment schedule which requires payments of $39
600 respectively on sixth
 ninth and twelfth month anniversary dates of issuance. The December 2015 Notes included an aggregate $10
000 original issuance discount (&ldquo;OID&rdquo;) which resulted in net proceeds of $100
000. The December 2015 Note provides for customary events of default such as failing to timely make payments and the occurrence of certain fundamental defaults
 as described in the December 2015 Note. The Note is not secured and is subordinated to senior notes issued by the Company and ranks equally with other debt issued by the Company. As an inducement for the loan
 the Company issued the December 2015 Lender 500
000 restricted common shares valued at a non-cash cost of $30
050.


 2017
 the balance on the December 2015 Note was $nil. At December 31
 2016
 the balance on the December 2015 Note was $32
081. This included the remaining face value and accrued interest totaling $39
600
 net of an unamortized BCF discount of $6
340 and an unamortized OID discount of $1
179. During the year ended December 31
 2016
 the Company timely met two scheduled cash payments totaling $79
200 and
 prior to scheduled redemption date
 on December 2
 2016 the lender extended the maturity date of the note to March 7
 2016 in exchange for 300
000 shares of the Company and the right to convert the balance of $39
600 into common shares of the Company at a price of $0.04 per share. On December 2
 2016
 the Company&#39;s closing share price was $0.05 which created a BCF valued at $9
405 and a non-cash cost for the shares issuance of $15
000. During the year ended December 31
 2016
 a total of $3
065 of the BCF discount was recorded as an amortization expense and $8
056 amortization of the OID was recorded as interest expense.


 2017
 the balance on the December 2015 Note was $nil. In the fourth quarter of 2017
 the December 2015 Note was converted into a stock issuance. The conversion resulted in a difference between the cash redemption balance and the value of the shares redemption which was treated as a conversion loss of $19
800 and has been recognized in the Statements of Operations as a Loss on Debt Modification
 conversions
 and settlement in Other Income (Expense).



 2015
 we issued a Senior Convertible Note (&ldquo;LPC Note One&rdquo;) to Lincoln Park Capital Fund
 LLC (&ldquo;LPC&rdquo;) in the amount of $250
000. LPC Note One was issued pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement and bears interest at the rate of 5% per annum (or 18% upon the occurrence of an event of default). Principal and interest is due and payable in full on December 31
 2016 and LPC Note One is now classified as short term convertible debt. Interest may be paid via issuance of the Company&rsquo;s common stock if the Company meets certain conditions that would allow the issuance of the Company&rsquo;s common stock without any trading restrictions. LPC Note One has a $25
000 original issuance discount (&ldquo;OID&rdquo;) which resulted in net proceeds of $225
000. The Company has the right to prepay LPC Note One
 pursuant to the terms thereof
 at any time
 provided it pays a prepayment amount of 120% of the then outstanding balance
 accrued interest and interest payable from the date of prepayment to the Maturity Date. LPC Note One provides for customary events of default such as failing to timely make payments and the occurrence of certain fundamental defaults
 as described in LPC Note One. LPC Note One is not secured and is subordinated to the VDF Note
 ranks equally with LPC Note Two
 and ranks above other debt issued by the Company. The principal amount of LPC Note One and all accrued interest were convertible at the option of LPC into shares of our common stock at any time at a fixed Conversion Price of $0.07 per share
 subject to adjustments for stock splits
 stock dividends
 stock combinations or other similar transactions as provided in LPC Note One. At no time may LPC Note One be converted into shares of our common stock if such conversion would result in LPC and its affiliates owning an aggregate of shares of our common stock in excess of 4.99% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock
As an inducement for the loan
 on August 18
 2015 the Company granted LPC 3
750
000 six year warrants
 which includes a cashless exercise provision
 to purchase&nbsp;3
750
000 restricted shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.10 per share which was valued using a Black-Scholes model at a non-cash cost of $277
014. At August 18
 2015
 LPC Note One also included a BCF of $107
143 because the exercise price of LPC Note One was set below the market price of our stock when the note was executed. Since the combined warrant discount and BCF exceeded the face value of the note less OID
 the warrant discount for LPC Note One was capped at $117
857
 resulting in a total discount of $225
On December 16
 2016
 prior to the scheduled redemption dates
 LPC extended the maturities of each of its two notes from December 31
 2016 to December 31
 2017 in return for issuance by the Company of 7
000
000 six year warrants
 with cashless exercise rights
 to purchase&nbsp;7
000
000 restricted shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.05 per share. The warrants were valued using a Black-Scholes model at a non-cash cost of $315
658
 of which $143
481 was ascribed as an increase to the discount of LPC Note One and $172
177 was ascribed as an increase to the discount of LPC Note Two.









 2016
 the recorded balance on LPC Note One was $68
086. This included the remaining face value of 250
000
 net of an unamortized warrant and BCF discounts totaling $177
505 and an unamortized OID discount of $4
409. During the year ended December 31
 2016
 $130
348 of the BCF and warrant discounts were recorded as an amortization expense
 $13
854 of the OID was recorded as interest expense
 and accrued interest of $12
708 was paid via issuances of 181
544 restricted common shares.


 2017
 the recorded balance on LPC Note One was $140
035. During the year ended December 31
 2017 $177
505 of the BCF and warrant discounts were recorded as amortization expenses
 and $4
409 of the OID amortization was recorded as interest expenses. In the fourth quarter of 2017
 in three transactions
 LPC settled $250
000 principal and $6
164 accrued interest due on LPC Note One as discussed in Note 9. The settlement resulted in a $454
105 difference between the cash redemption balance and the value of the shares redemption which was treated as a modification loss and has been recognized in the Statements of Operations as a Loss on Debt Modification
 conversions
 and settlement in Other Income (Expense).



 2015
 we issued a Senior Convertible Note (&ldquo;LPC Note Two&rdquo;) to LPC in the amount of $300
000. LPC Note Two was issued pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement and bears interest at the rate of 5% per annum (or 18% upon the occurrence of an event of default). Principal and interest is due and payable in full on December 31
 2016. LPC Note Two is now classified as short term convertible term debt. Interest may be paid via issuance of the Company&rsquo;s common stock if the Company meets certain conditions that would allow the issuance of the Company&rsquo;s common stock without any trading restrictions. LPC Note Two has a $30
000 OID which resulted in net proceeds of $270
000. The Company has the right to prepay LPC Note Two
 pursuant to the terms thereof
 at any time
 provided it pays a prepayment amount of 120% of the then outstanding balance
 accrued interest and interest payable from the date of prepayment to the Maturity Date. LPC Note Two provides for customary events of default such as failing to timely make payments and the occurrence of certain fundamental defaults
 as described in LPC Note Two. LPC Note Two is not secured and is subordinated to the VDF Note
 ranks equally with LPC Note One
 and ranks above other debt issued by the Company. The principal amount of LPC Note Two and all accrued interest is convertible at the option of LPC into shares of our common stock at any time at a fixed Conversion Price of $0.05 per share
 subject to adjustments for stock splits
 stock dividends
 stock combinations or other similar transactions as provided in LPC Note Two. At no time may LPC Note Two be converted into shares of our common stock if such conversion would result in LPC and its affiliates owning an aggregate of shares of our common stock in excess of 4.99% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock
 provided such percentage may increase to 9.99% upon not less than 61 days prior written notice. On November 23
 2015
 as an inducement for the loan the


000
000 six year warrants
 which includes a cashless exercise provision
 to purchase&nbsp;5
000
000 shares of our restricted common stock at an exercise price of $0.07 per share which was valued using a Black-Scholes model at a cost of $253
098. At November 23
 2015
 LPC Note Two also included a BCF of $102
600 because the exercise price of LPC Note Two was set below the market price of our stock when the note was executed. Since the combined warrant discount and BCF exceeded the face value of the note less OID
 the warrant discount for LPC Note Two was capped at $167
400
 resulting in a total discount of $270
000. On December 16
 2016
 prior to the scheduled redemption dates
 LPC extended the maturities of each of its two notes from December 31
 2016 to December 31
 2017 in return for issuance by the Company of 7
000
000 six year warrants
 with cashless exercise rights
 to purchase&nbsp;7
000
000 restricted shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.05 per share. The warrants were valued using a Black-Scholes model at a non-cash cost of $315
658
 of which $143
481 was ascribed as an increase to the discount of LPC Note One and $172
177 was ascribed as an increase to the discount of LPC Note Two.


 2017
 LPC converted $300
000 principal and $3
060 accrued interest due on LPC Note Two into 6
105
843 shares valued at $405
361 based on market close prices on dates of issuance. The conversions resulted in a $98
963 difference between the cash redemption balance and the value of the shares redemption which was treated as a conversion loss and has been recognized in the Statements of Operations as a Loss on Debt Modification
 conversions
 and settlement in Other Income (Expense). Concurrent with the conversions
 $210
745 of the warrant discount was recorded as an amortization expense and $6
162 OID was recorded as interest expense. For the year ended December 31
 2017
 excluding the conversion amortization adjustments
 $13
693 of the remaining warrant discount was recorded as amortization expense and $400 of the remaining OID was recorded as interest expense.


 2017
 the recorded balance on LPC Note Two was $nil. At December 31
 2016
 the recorded balance on LPC Note Two was $69
000. This included the remaining face value of $300
000
 net of an unamortized discount of $224
438 and an unamortized OID of $6
562.












 2016
 the Company issued a $100

 2017 and&nbsp;is classified as short term related party debt.&nbsp;The RP Note bears interest at 8% per annum due at maturity and may be prepaid in whole

 the lender extended the maturity of the RP Note to July 27
 2017 in return for&nbsp;340
000 restricted common shares valued at $16
592 at market close price on date of issue.&nbsp;On September 25

 the lender further extended the maturity of the RP Note to December 31
 2017 in return for&nbsp;340
000 restricted common shares valued at $14
620 at market close price on date of issue.&nbsp; On July 18
 2017
 the Company issued a $100
000 note (the &ldquo;RP Note Two) to such director of the Company for a loan. The RP Note Two had an original maturity date of December 31
 2017
 and is classified as short term related party debt. The RP Note Two bears interest at 8% per annum due at maturity and may be prepaid in whole
 or in part
 at any time before the maturity date without prepayment penalty. As an inducement for the loan
 the Company repriced the RP Noteholder&rsquo;s warrants from $0.17 to $0.055. At&nbsp;December 31
 2017
 the balance due on the RP Note was $0
 in accordance with the debt modification.



 2017
 the Company issued a $100
000 note (the &ldquo;SFC Note&rdquo;) to a long term shareholder of the Company for a loan. The SFC Note has maturity date of August 14
 2017 and bears interest at 8% per annum due at maturity and may be prepaid in whole
 or in part
 at any time before each maturity date without prepayment penalty. As an inducement for the loan

800 valued at market close price on date of issue. At December 31
 2017
 the balance due on the SFC Note was $0 in accordance with the debt conversion into Preferred Series B shares resulting in a loss of $139
751 and has been recognized in the Statements of Operations as a Loss on Debt Modification
 conversions
 and settlement in Other Income (Expense).





 2014
 we entered into a patent settlement with VDF FutureCeuticals
 Inc. (&ldquo;VDF&rdquo;) at which time a senior convertible note (the &ldquo;VDF Note&rdquo;) was issued to VDF
 whereby we promised to pay VDF a principal amount equal to the sum of aggregate accrued and unpaid patent license fee payments plus accrued interest. The maturity of the VDF Note is December 31
 2018 unless accelerated pursuant to an event of default or the License Agreement is terminated and all accrued and unpaid obligations under the VDF Note have been paid. Due to its term the VDF Note is classified as long term debt. Interest on the note is 7% per annum
 subject to an adjustment to 12% for events of default and we have the right
 subject to certain limitations
 to prepay principal at any time and from time to time. At any time VDF has the option to convert any principal outstanding on the VDF Note into shares of our common stock at a Conversion Price determined by the terms of the VDF Note
 which is subject to adjustment based on our issuance of stock and other securities. During the year ended December 31
 2016
 the Conversion Price of the Senior Convertible Note was adjusted from $0.3823 per share to $0.2157 per share per the terms of the Senior Convertible Note. The VDF Note provides that we may
 at our option
 roll-over to the VDF Note quarterly License fee payments and accrued interest and is secured through the Pledge and Security Agreement (&ldquo;PSA&rdquo;) and is senior to any other debt issued by the Company unless prior written consent of VDF is obtained to amend the ranking.


 2016
 the VDF Note had an outstanding balance $869
674. This included the principal due of $886
460
 net of a discount of $16
786 resulting from the embedded derivative. During the year ended December 31
 2016
 we rolled-over License fee payments totaling $375
000 and recorded accrued interest of $42
188 for a total addition to the VDF Note of $417
188.


 2017
 VDF and the Company executed an addendum to the VDF Note and the PSA in which VDF agreed it will: (i) remove its lien on the Company&rsquo;s inventory and accounts receivable in the event that the Company executes any line of credit
 inventory purchase order financing
 or accounts receivable factoring agreements with third party lender(s); and (ii) promptly execute any inter-creditor agreement(s) provided to VDF by such third party lender(s) which affirm VDF&rsquo;s permission for the creation of liens by the third party lender(s) which rank in priority above VDF&rsquo;s existing lien. A copy of this agreement is attached to this Report as Exhibit 10.54.









 2017
 the Company and VDF signed an amendment to the Senior Convertible Note. Per the amendment the companies agreed that the total new outstanding balance was $916
457
 and that VDF would immediately convert all of the debt into 13
092
242 common shares at a conversion price of $.07/share
 resulting in 13
092
242 common shares being issued to VDF. The modification loss of $335
409 has been recognized in the Statements of Operations as a Loss on Debt Modification
 conversions
 and settlement in Other Income (Expense). At December 31
 2017
 the VDF Note had an outstanding balance of $0.




 the Company may sell options or warrants to purchase our common stock. In certain circumstances
 the convertible debt
 options or warrants may be classified as derivative liabilities
 rather than as equity. Additionally
 the debt or equity instruments may contain embedded derivative instruments
 such as embedded derivative features which in certain circumstances may be required to be bifurcated from the associated host instrument and accounted for separately as a derivative instrument liability. The Company&rsquo;s derivative instrument liabilities are re-valued at the end of each reporting period
 with changes in the fair value of the derivative liability recorded as charges or credits to income in the period in which the changes occur. For options
 warrants and bifurcated embedded derivative features that are accounted for as derivative instrument liabilities
 the Company estimates fair value using either quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics or other valuation techniques. The valuation techniques require assumptions related to the remaining term of the instruments and risk-free rates of return
 our current common stock price and expected dividend yield
 and the expected volatility of our common stock price over the life of the option.


 2017.


 2017
 the derivative balance of $11
649 related to VDF Note was settled per Note amendment and subsequent conversion of VDF Note to equity. Per amendment
 the Note was fully satisfied and canceled upon issuance of 13
092
242 common shares at $0.07 per share.


 on October 24
 2017 in connection with the issuance of the Series A Preferred shares
 the shareholders also received warrants to purchased Series A Preferred shares and Common Stock shares. The value of the Series A warrants and tainted Common Stock warrants are included in the table below.

 the Warrants need to be accounted for as derivative instruments. These warrants taint the equity environment. Existing warrants were evaluated to determine if they are scoped out of derivative treatment. Since the Company had a number of existing warrants and options previously outstanding
 based on the warrants issued in the October 24
 2017 financing
 these warrants and options must be valued as derivative instruments because the equity environment is tainted
 as of the quarterly period end date of December 31
 2017.


 2017
 the change in the fair market value of the derivative liability of $9

500
000 shares of common stock
 with a par value of $0.001 per share; and 10
000 shares of preferred stock at a par value of 0.001
 with no outstanding shares. The holders of common stock have dividend rights
 liquidation rights and voting rights of one vote for each share of common stock. In October 2017
 the Company created the Series A Preferred Stock series and the Series B Preferred Stock series. The Series A Preferred Stock series has 6
500 authorized shares and the Series B Preferred Stock series has 810 authorized shares.&nbsp; There are 1554 Series A and 252 Series B preferred shares issued and outstanding. The terms of any future preferred shares issuances will be as determined by the Board of Directors. As of December 31
 2017
 there were 226
116
621 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding.




 2017
 we issued 250
000 restricted common shares at $0.0484 per share to a new director at market close price on date of grant as an inducement fee for joining our Board for a deemed non-cash cost of $12
100. These shares were issued to one Accredited Investor (as that term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under Securities Act of 1933
 as amended (the &ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;) Rule 506 of Regulation D
 and in issuing these shares we relied on the exemptions from registration requirements provided for in Rule 506 of Regulation D and/or Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.


 2017
 we issued 340
000 restricted common shares at $0.0488 per share to an Accredited Investor related party at market close price on date of grant as an inducement fee extension of the maturity of a promissory note for a deemed non-cash cost of $16
592. These shares were issued to one non-U.S. person (as that term is defined in Regulation S of the Securities Act) in offshore transactions in which we relied on the exemptions from registration requirements provided for in Regulation S and/or Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.


 2017
 we remedially executed a private placement related to the Company&rsquo;s previous Unit Offer #3 which raised $15
000 through the sale of 375
000 units. Each unit was priced at $0.04 per unit and comprised of one restricted common share price plus one five year warrant exercisable to purchase one restricted common share at $0.055 per share. The fair market value of the shares and embedded value of the warrants is based on the valuations done for Unit Offer #3. These shares were issued to one non-U.S. person (as that term is defined in Regulation S of the Securities Act) in offshore transactions in which we relied on the exemptions from registration requirements provided for in Regulation S and/or Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The warrants were valued using a Black-Scholes model at a non-cash cost of $16
463. At September 30
 2017
 none of these warrants had been exercised.


 2017
 we issued 340
000 restricted common shares to an Accredited Investor long term shareholder at $0.07 per share at market close price on date of grant as an inducement fee for a $100
000 promissory note for a deemed non-cash cost of $23
800. These shares were issued to one non-U.S. person (as that term is defined in Regulation S of the Securities Act) in offshore transactions in which we relied on the exemptions from registration requirements provided for in Regulation S and/or Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.









 2017
 in two transactions we issued a total of 1
625
000 common shares at $0.04 per share for conversion by September 2015 Note Two Purchaser of the remaining $65
000 due on September 2015 Note Two. The market values of the shares totaled $128
463 based on market close prices on dates of issuance. The conversions resulted in a $63
463 difference between the cash redemption balance and the value of the shares redemption which was treated as a conversion loss and recorded as an additional non-cash interest expense. These conversions fully satisfied the note and no further payments are due.




 2017
 we issued 1
500
000 restricted common shares to two prior unit offering subscribers for exercises of 1
500
000 warrants they held at the exercise price $0.055 per share for proceeds of $82
500. These subscribers are Accredited Investors (as that term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act)
 and in issuing these shares we relied on the exemptions from registration requirements provided for in Rule 506 of Regulation D and/or Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.


 2017
 we issued 990
000 common shares at $0.04 per share for conversion by December 2015 Lender of the remaining $39

 2017 and December 31
 2016 we shared our warehouse premises with a sublessee whose occupancy ended on April 7
 2017
 at which time we assumed all lease payments. We also utilize offices provided by our CEO. The current distribution facility lease has a term of June 1
 2016 to May 31
 2018 and presently requires total lease payments of $10

 2016
 the Company extended the lease for an additional 24 month term and committed to total lease payments of $10
466 for June 1

 2014 we entered into a coffee fruit patent license
 Coffeeberry&reg;&nbsp;trademark license and raw materials supply agreement with VDF FutureCeuticals

 2018. Payment requirements are accelerated pursuant to an event of default
 or if the License Agreement is terminated. Interest on the Senior Convertible Note is 7% per annum
 subject to adjustment to 12% for events of default. By maturity
 we must pay VDF all principal plus accrued interest and we have the right
 subject to certain limitations
 to prepay principal at any time and from time to time. No indebtedness shall rank senior to the payments due under the VDF Note unless prior written consent of VDF is obtained and payments under the note are secured by the Security Agreement as described below. At any time and at the option of VDF
 principal outstanding on the VDF Note may be converted into restricted common shares of the Company. The conversion price of the VDF Note was $0.2157 per share.

 2016. For the year ended December 31
 2017
 the concentration of our beverage sales comprised sales to three major retail chain store customers totaling 41%. For the year ended December 31
 2016 the concentration of our beverage sales comprised sales to three major retail customers totaling 43%. Although the market for our products is elastic and current purchasers of our products are replaceable

 2016 our purchases from suppliers comprised a concentration of 55% from three suppliers and 79% from three suppliers

 our management conducted an evaluation (under the supervision and with the participation of Kyle Redfield
 our Chief Executive Officer (and also the person performing the functions of a chief financial officer for us)&nbsp;as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)&nbsp;under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation
 Mr. Redfield concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act
 (i)&nbsp;is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&rsquo;s rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including Mr. Redfield
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.



 as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and&nbsp;the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


 2017. Management&rsquo;s assessment was based on criteria set forth in 
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based upon this assessment
 management concluded that
 as of December 31
 2017
 our internal control over financial reporting was not effective
 based upon those criteria
 as a result of the identification of the material weaknesses described below.


 such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.


 management identified the following control weaknesses: (i) the Company has not implemented measures that would prevent one individual from overriding the internal control system; (ii) as of December 31
 2017
 the Company did not maintain a complete onsite financial department staff (e.g.
 there was no onsite chief financial officer); (iii) the Company utilizes accounting software that does not prevent erroneous or unauthorized changes to previous reporting periods and/or can be adjusted so as not to provide an adequate audit trail of entries made in the accounting software; and (iv) the Company&rsquo;s policies and procedures do not document any process for reviewing and approving or ratifying &ldquo;related person transactions&rdquo; . The Company does not believe that these control weakness have resulted in deficient financial reporting. However
 the Company plans to conduct appropriate review and oversight of all related person transactions for potential conflict of interest situations on an ongoing basis.


 the Company will alleviate material weaknesses through various steps.











 our fourth fiscal quarter of 2017) that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting. However
 our Investor Rights Agreement dated October 24
 2017 provided that Kona Holdings I LLC (but not any assignee of Kona Holdings I LLC) shall serve as a consultant to the Corporation and in such capacity shall advise the Corporation providing strategic advice
 industry connections
 operational resources
 monthly financial review
 analysis
 establishing strong financial controls and reporting
 etc. We expect that this (in conjunction with the equity capital invested by Kona Holdings I LLC and other investors on October 24
 2017 and thereafter) will in due course result in various improvements to our internal control over financial reporting.

Kyle Redfield &ndash; Current Chief Executive Office
 Former President and Chief Operating Officer


 2017
 Mr. Redfield assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer and entered into a two-year employment letter agreement with a base salary of $210
000 per year
 increasing to $250
000 per year effective October 24
 2018 (but rolled back effective January 1
 2019
 because the Company achieved less than $7
000
000 in net sales in 2018)

000. In addition
 Mr. Redfield will be provided with an annual automobile allowance of $7
800 to be paid monthly.


 during the term of the employment letter agreement and for a period of 12 months from the termination of the Agreement
 directly or non-directly solicit or recruit any of the Company&rsquo;s employees or divulge any confidential information of the Company.




 our Board of Directors has established compensation policies and practices for senior management that include a relative overweighting of equity-based compensation and a relative underweighting of current cash compensation. The Board of Directors believes that
 in addition to preserving the Company&rsquo;s limited cash resources
 this aligns the interest of senior management with the interest of shareholders. (In addition
 the Board of Directors believes that
 given the nature and phase of development of our Company
 the persons who have chosen to be and remain our shareholders expect and desire that management take significant risks with the goal of achieving rapid growth
 and so that to the extent our compensation policies and practices tend our management toward risk-taking
 that result is consistent with the desires of our shareholder body (and also consistent with the best interest of the Company).




 2017
 we paid no cash fees and no equity-based compensation to our directors (other than compensation to our named executive officers Kyle Redfield and Shaun Roberts
 all of which compensation is fully reflected in the Summary Compensation Table).













 as of January 18
 2019 by each person known to us to own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock or outstanding preferred stock. (Directors and officers who could have been included both in this table and in the following &ldquo;Security Ownership of Management&rdquo; table are
 however
 included only in the following &ldquo;Security Ownership of Management&rdquo; table.)

 such failure in and of itself shall not preclude any VB Indemnitee&rsquo;s right to recover hereunder except to the extent of the portion of a Loss that should have been mitigated by the VB Indemnitees&rsquo; commercially reasonable actions but that was not so mitigated.

 an earnings statement of the Corporation that will satisfy the provisions of Section&nbsp;11(a) of the Securities Act covering a period of 12 months beginning after the effective date of such registration statement as soon as reasonably practicable after the termination of such 12-month period.

 It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the Corporation to take any action pursuant to this Section&nbsp;1 with respect to the Registrable Securities of any selling Holder that such Holder shall furnish to the Corporation such information regarding such Holder
 the Registrable Securities held by it
 and the intended method of disposition of such securities as shall be required to effect the registration of such Holder&rsquo;s Registrable Securities. The Corporation shall have no obligation with respect to any registration requested pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.2 or Section&nbsp;1.4 of this Agreement if
 as a result of the application of the preceding sentence
 the anticipated aggregate bona fide price of the Registrable Securities to be included in the registration does not equal or exceed the anticipated aggregate offering price required to originally trigger the Corporation&rsquo;s obligation to initiate such registration as specified in subsection&nbsp;1.2(a) or subsection&nbsp;1.4(b)(ii)
 whichever is applicable.

 unless the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities agree to forfeit their right to one demand registration pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.2; provided further
 however
 that if at the time of such withdrawal
 the Holders (i)&nbsp;have learned of a material adverse change in the condition
 business
 or prospects of the Corporation that was not known to the Holders at the time of their request and (ii)&nbsp;have withdrawn the request with reasonable promptness following disclosure by the Corporation of such material adverse change
 then the Holders shall not be required to pay any of such expenses and shall not forfeit their rights pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.2.

 In connection with any offering involving an underwriting of shares of the Corporation&rsquo;s capital stock
 the Corporation shall not be required under Section&nbsp;1.3 to include any of the Holders&rsquo; securities in such underwriting unless they accept the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between the Corporation and the underwriters selected by the Corporation (or by other persons entitled to select the underwriters)
 and then only in such quantity as the underwriters determine in their sole discretion will not jeopardize the success of the offering by the Corporation. If the total amount of securities
 including Registrable Securities
 requested by stockholders to be included in such offering exceeds the amount of securities sold other than by the Corporation that the underwriters determine in their sole discretion is compatible with the success of the offering
 then the Corporation shall be required to include in the offering only that number of such securities
 including Registrable Securities
 which the underwriters determine in their sole discretion will not jeopardize the success of the offering (the securities so included to be apportioned pro rata among the selling stockholders according to the total amount of securities entitled to be included therein owned by each selling stockholder or in such other proportions as shall mutually be agreed to by such selling stockholders) but in no event shall the amount of securities of the selling Holders included in the offering be reduced below 25% of the total amount of securities included in such offering
 unless such offering is the &ldquo;new&rdquo; initial public offering of the Corporation&rsquo;s securities
 in which case
 the selling stockholders may be excluded if the underwriters make the determination described above and no other stockholder&rsquo;s securities are included. For purposes of the preceding parenthetical concerning apportionment

 or a partnership or corporation
 the Affiliated Funds
 partners
 retired partners and stockholders of such holder
 or the estates and family members of any such partners and retired partners and any trusts for the benefit of any of the foregoing persons shall be deemed to be a single &ldquo;
&rdquo; and any pro-rata reduction with respect to such &ldquo;selling stockholder&rdquo; shall be based upon the aggregate amount of shares carrying registration rights owned by all entities and individuals included in such &ldquo;selling stockholder
&rdquo; as defined in this sentence.

 within a reasonable time after such transfer
 furnished with written notice of the name and address of such transferee or assignee and the securities with respect to which such registration rights are being assigned; and

 and shall not apply to a registration relating solely to employee benefit plans
 or to a registration relating solely to a transaction pursuant to Rule&nbsp;145 under the Securities Act. In addition
 the Corporation shall endeavor to ensure that any written agreement described in subsection 1.14(a) includes a provision that in the event of any early release
 the holders of Registrable Securities will be proportionately released from such market stand-off agreements.

 The validity
 interpretation
 construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California
 without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws.

 This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the Corporation and me relating to the subject matter herein and merges all prior discussions between us. No modification or amendment to this Agreement
 nor any waiver of any rights under this Agreement
 will be effective unless in writing signed by both parties.

If any term or provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any circumstance shall
 in any jurisdiction and to any extent
 be invalid or unenforceable
 such term or provision shall be ineffective as to such jurisdiction to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without invalidating or rendering unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or the application of such terms and provisions to circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable
 and a suitable and equitable term or provision shall be substituted therefor to carry out
 insofar as may be valid and enforceable
 the intent and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision. In the event that any court or government agency of competent jurisdiction determines that
 notwithstanding the terms of the Consulting Agreement specifying my Relationship with the Corporation as that of an independent contractor
 my provision of services to the Corporation is not as an independent contractor but instead as an employee under the applicable laws
 then solely to the extent that such determination is applicable
 references in this Agreement to the Relationship between me and the Corporation shall be interpreted to include an employment relationship
 and this Agreement shall not be invalid and unenforceable but shall be read to the fullest extent as may be valid and enforceable under the applicable laws to carry out the intent and purpose of the Agreement.

 This Agreement will be binding upon my heirs
 executors
 administrators and other legal representatives
 and my successors and assigns

 in the event that Consultant is an entity
 any successor entity
 and will be for the benefit of the Corporation Group
 the Corporation
 its successors
 and its assigns. The members of the Corporation Group besides the Corporation are express third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement.



. I acknowledge and agree that violation of this Agreement by me may cause the Corporation Group irreparable harm
 and therefore agree that the Corporation Group









 including but not limited to temporary restraining orders
 preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions without the necessity of posting a bond or other security and in addition to and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that the Corporation Group may have for a breach of this Agreement.

 I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
 IN EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT
 I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL
 AND I HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD ALL OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AGAINST ANY PARTY BY REASON OF THE DRAFTING OR PREPARATION HEREOF.

. The parties agree that if the consultant which is a party to this Agreement is an entity rather than an individual
 then words such as &ldquo;I
&rdquo; &ldquo;me&rdquo; and &ldquo;my&rdquo; shall all be construed as referring to such entity
 and not to any individual (although such entity shall be responsible for ensuring that the individuals connected with it do not do anything which would result in the entity breaching this Agreement.

EXCLUDED UNDER SECTION 7(b)








































	
	










 



 Employees
 Directors and Consultants are eligible to receive Stock Awards.

 The Plan provides for the grant of the following types of Stock Awards: (i)&nbsp;Incentive Stock Options
 (ii)&nbsp;Nonstatutory Stock Options
 (iii) Stock Appreciation Rights
 (iv) Restricted Stock Awards
 (v) Restricted Stock Unit Awards and (vi) Other Stock Awards.

 The Plan
 through the granting of Stock Awards
 is intended to help the Company secure and retain the services of eligible award recipients
 provide incentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company and any Affiliate and provide a means by which the eligible recipients may benefit from increases in value of the Common Stock.



 The Board will administer the Plan. The Board may delegate administration of the Plan to a Committee or Committees
 as provided in Section 2(c).

 The Board will have the power
 subject to
 and within the limitations of
 the express provisions of the Plan:

&nbsp;To determine (A) who will be granted Stock Awards; (B) when and how each Stock Award will be granted; (C) what type of Stock Award will be granted; (D) the provisions of each Stock Award (which need not be identical)
 including when a person will be permitted to exercise or otherwise receive cash or Common Stock under the Stock Award; (E) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to a Stock Award; and (F) the Fair Market Value applicable to a Stock Award.

&nbsp;To construe and interpret the Plan and Stock Awards granted under it
 and to establish
 amend and revoke rules and regulations for administration of the Plan and Stock Awards. The Board
 in the exercise of these powers
 may correct any defect
 omission or inconsistency in the Plan or in any Stock Award Agreement
 in a manner and to the extent it will deem necessary or expedient to make the Plan or Stock Award fully effective.










&nbsp;To accelerate
 in whole or in part
 the time at which a Stock Award may be exercised or vest (or at which cash or shares of Common Stock may be issued).

&nbsp;To suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or a Stock Award Agreement
 suspension or termination of the Plan will not impair a Participant&rsquo;s rights under his or her then-outstanding Stock Award without his or her written consent except as provided in subsection (viii) below.

&nbsp;To amend the Plan in any respect the Board deems necessary or advisable
 including
 without limitation
 by adopting amendments relating to Incentive Stock Options and certain nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code and/or to make the Plan or Stock Awards granted under the Plan compliant with the requirements for Incentive Stock Options or exempt from or compliant with the requirements for nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code
 subject to the limitations
 if any
 of applicable law. However
 if required by applicable law
 and except as provided in Section&nbsp;9(a) relating to Capitalization Adjustments
 the Company will seek stockholder approval of any amendment of the Plan that (A)&nbsp;materially increases the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan
 (B)&nbsp;materially expands the class of individuals eligible to receive Stock Awards under the Plan
 (C)&nbsp;materially increases the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan
 (D) materially reduces the price at which shares of Common Stock may be issued or purchased under the Plan
 (E)&nbsp;materially extends the term of the Plan
 or (F)&nbsp;materially expands the types of Stock Awards available for issuance under the Plan. Except as provided in the Plan (including subsection (viii) below) or a Stock Award Agreement
 no amendment of the Plan will impair a Participant&rsquo;s rights under an outstanding Stock Award unless (1) the Company requests the consent of the affected Participant
 and (2) such Participant consents in writing.

&nbsp;To submit any amendment to the Plan for stockholder approval
 including
 but not limited to
 amendments to the Plan intended to satisfy the requirements of Section&nbsp;422 of the Code regarding Incentive Stock Options.

&nbsp;To approve forms of Stock Award Agreements for use under the Plan and to amend the terms of any one or more Stock Awards
 including
 but not limited to
 amendments to provide terms more favorable to the Participant than previously provided in the Stock Award Agreement


 and (B)&nbsp;such Participant consents in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 (1) a Participant&rsquo;s rights will not be deemed to have been impaired by any such amendment if the Board
 in its sole discretion
 determines that the amendment
 taken as a whole
 does not materially impair the Participant&rsquo;s rights
 and (2) subject to the limitations of applicable law
 if any
 the Board may amend the terms of any one or more Stock Awards without the affected Participant&rsquo;s consent (A)&nbsp;to maintain the qualified status of the Stock Award as an Incentive Stock Option under Section 422 of the Code; (B) to change the terms of an Incentive Stock Option
 if such change results in impairment of the Award solely because it impairs the qualified status of the Award as an Incentive Stock Option under Section 422 of the Code; (C) to clarify the manner of exemption from
 or to bring the Stock Award into compliance with
 Section 409A of the Code; or (D) to comply with other applicable laws.








&nbsp;Generally
 to exercise such powers and to perform such acts as the Board deems necessary or expedient to promote the best interests of the Company and that are not in conflict with the provisions of the Plan or Stock Awards.

&nbsp;To adopt such procedures and sub-plans as are necessary or appropriate to permit participation in the Plan by Employees
 Directors or Consultants who are foreign nationals or employed outside the United States (provided that Board approval will not be necessary for immaterial modifications to the Plan or any Stock Award Agreement that are required for compliance with the laws of the relevant foreign jurisdiction).

&nbsp;To effect
 with the consent of any adversely affected Participant
 (A) the reduction of the exercise
 purchase or strike price of any outstanding Stock Award; (B) the cancellation of any outstanding Stock Award and the grant in substitution therefor of a new (1) Option or SAR
 (2) Restricted Stock Award
 (3) Restricted Stock Unit Award
 (4) Other Stock Award
 (5) cash and/or (6) other valuable consideration determined by the Board
 in its sole discretion
 with any such substituted award (x) covering the same or a different number of shares of Common Stock as the cancelled Stock Award and (y) granted under the Plan or another equity or compensatory plan of the Company; or (C) any other action that is treated as a repricing under generally accepted accounting principles.

 The Board may delegate some or all of the administration of the Plan to a Committee or Committees. If administration of the Plan is delegated to a Committee
 the Committee will have
 in connection with the administration of the Plan
 the powers theretofore possessed by the Board that have been delegated to the Committee
 including the power to delegate to a subcommittee of the Committee any of the administrative powers the Committee is authorized to exercise (and references in this Plan to the Board will thereafter be to the Committee or subcommittee). Any delegation of administrative powers will be reflected in resolutions
 not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan
 adopted from time to time by the Board or Committee (as applicable). The Committee may
 at any time
 abolish the subcommittee and/or revest in the Committee any powers delegated to the subcommittee. The Board may retain the authority to concurrently administer the Plan with the Committee and may
 at any time
 revest in the Board some or all of the powers previously delegated.

 The Board may delegate to one (1) or more Officers the authority to do one or both of the following: (i) designate Employees who are not Officers to be recipients of Options and SARs (and
 to the extent permitted by applicable law
 other Stock Awards) and
 to the extent permitted by applicable law
 the terms of such Stock Awards
 and (ii) determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be subject to such Stock Awards granted to such Employees; provided
 however
 that the Board resolutions regarding such delegation will specify the total number of shares of Common Stock that may be subject to the Stock Awards granted by such Officer and that such Officer may not grant a Stock Award to himself or herself. Any such Stock Awards will be granted on the form of Stock Award Agreement most recently approved for use by the Committee or the Board
 unless otherwise provided in the resolutions approving the delegation authority. The Board may not delegate authority to an Officer who is acting solely in the capacity of an Officer (and not also as a Director) to determine the Fair Market Value pursuant to Section&nbsp;13(u) below.








 All determinations
 interpretations and constructions made by the Board in good faith will not be subject to review by any person and will be final
 binding and conclusive on all persons.





&nbsp;Subject to Section 9(a) relating to Capitalization Adjustments
 the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to Stock Awards from and after the Effective Date will not exceed 36
737
&rdquo;). For clarity
 the Share Reserve in this Section&nbsp;3(a) is a limitation on the number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to the Plan. Accordingly
 this Section 3(a) does not limit the granting of Stock Awards except as provided in Section&nbsp;7(a).


 the Participant receives cash rather than stock)
 such expiration
 termination or settlement will not reduce (or otherwise offset) the number of shares of Common Stock that may be available for issuance under the Plan. If any shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to a Stock Award are forfeited back to or repurchased by the Company because of the failure to meet a contingency or condition required to vest such shares in the Participant
 then the shares that are forfeited or repurchased will revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan. Any shares reacquired by the Company in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations on a Stock Award or as consideration for the exercise or purchase price of a Stock Award will again become available for issuance under the Plan.

Subject to the Share Reserve and Section&nbsp;9(a) relating to Capitalization Adjustments
 the aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options will be 35
000
000 shares of Common Stock.

 The stock issuable under the Plan will be shares of authorized but unissued or reacquired Common Stock
 including shares repurchased by the Company on the open market or otherwise.



. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to employees of the Company or a &ldquo;parent corporation&rdquo; or &ldquo;subsidiary corporation&rdquo; thereof (as such terms are defined in Sections&nbsp;424(e) and 424(f) of the Code). Stock Awards other than Incentive Stock Options may be granted to Employees

 however
 that Stock Awards may not be granted to Employees
 Directors and Consultants who are providing Continuous Service only to any &ldquo;parent&rdquo; of the Company
 as such term is defined in Rule&nbsp;405
 unless (i) the stock underlying such Stock Awards is treated as &ldquo;service recipient stock&rdquo; under Section 409A of the Code (for example
 because the Stock Awards are granted pursuant to a corporate transaction such as a spin off transaction)
 or (ii) the Company
 in








 has determined that such Stock Awards are otherwise exempt from or alternatively comply with the distribution requirements of Section 409A of the Code.



A Consultant will not be eligible for the grant of a Stock Award if
 at the time of grant
 either the offer or sale of the Company&rsquo;s securities to such Consultant is not exempt under Rule&nbsp;701 because of the nature of the services that the Consultant is providing to the Company
 because the Consultant is not a natural person
 or because of any other provision of Rule&nbsp;701
 unless the Company determines that such grant need not comply with the requirements of Rule&nbsp;701 and will satisfy another exemption under the Securities Act as well as comply with the securities laws of all other relevant jurisdictions




 and
 if certificates are issued
 a separate certificate or certificates will be issued for shares of Common Stock purchased on exercise of each type of Option. If an Option is not specifically designated as an Incentive Stock Option
 or if an Option is designated as an Incentive Stock Option but some portion or all of the Option fails to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option under the applicable rules

 however
 that each Stock Award Agreement will conform to (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the applicable Stock Award Agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions:

 Subject to the provisions of Section&nbsp;4(b) regarding Ten Percent Stockholders
 no Option or SAR will be exercisable after the expiration of 10 years from the date of its grant or such shorter period specified in the Stock Award Agreement.

 Subject to the provisions of Section&nbsp;4(b) regarding Ten Percent Stockholders
 the exercise or strike price of each Option or SAR will be not less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to the Option or SAR on the date the Stock Award is granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 an Option or SAR may be granted with an exercise or strike price lower than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to the Stock Award if such Stock Award is granted pursuant to an assumption of or substitution for another option or stock appreciation right pursuant to a Corporate Transaction and in a manner consistent with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and
 if applicable
 Section 424(a) of the Code. Each SAR will be denominated in shares of Common Stock equivalents.

 The purchase price of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option may be paid
 to the extent permitted by applicable law and as determined by the Board in its sole discretion
 by any combination of the methods of payment










&nbsp;by cash
 check
 bank draft or money order payable to the Company;

&nbsp;pursuant to a program developed under Regulation&nbsp;T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board that
 before the issuance of the stock subject to the Option
 results in either the receipt of cash (or check) by the Company or the receipt of irrevocable instructions to pay the aggregate exercise price to the Company from the sales proceeds;



&nbsp;if an Option is a Nonstatutory Stock Option
 by a &ldquo;net exercise&rdquo; arrangement pursuant to which the Company will reduce the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise by the largest whole number of shares with a Fair Market Value that does not exceed the aggregate exercise price; provided
 however
 that the Company will accept a cash or other payment from the Participant to the extent of any remaining balance of the aggregate exercise price not satisfied by such reduction in the number of whole shares to be issued. Shares of Common Stock will no longer be subject to an Option and will not be exercisable thereafter to the extent that (A) shares issuable upon exercise are used to pay the exercise price pursuant to the &ldquo;net exercise
&rdquo; (B) shares are delivered to the Participant as a result of such exercise
 and (C) shares are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations; or



 To exercise any outstanding SAR
 the Participant must provide written notice of exercise to the Company in compliance with the provisions of the Stock Award Agreement evidencing such SAR. The appreciation distribution payable on the exercise of a SAR will be not greater than an amount equal to the excess of (A)&nbsp;the aggregate Fair Market Value (on the date of the exercise of the SAR) of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Common Stock equivalents in which the Participant is vested under such SAR
 and with respect to which the Participant is exercising the SAR on such date
 over (B) the aggregate strike price of the number of Common Stock equivalents with respect to which the Participant is exercising the SAR on such date. The appreciation distribution may be paid in Common Stock
 in cash
 in any combination of the two or in any other form of consideration
 as determined by the Board and contained in the Stock Award Agreement evidencing such SAR.

 The Board may
 in its sole discretion
 impose such limitations on the transferability of Options and SARs as the Board will determine. In the absence of such a determination by the Board to the contrary
 the following restrictions on the transferability of Options and SARs will apply:








. An Option or SAR will not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution (and pursuant to subsections (ii) and (iii) below)
 and will be exercisable during the lifetime of the Participant only by the Participant. The Board may permit transfer of the Option or SAR in a manner that is not prohibited by applicable tax and securities laws. Except as explicitly provided herein
 neither an Option nor a SAR may be transferred for consideration.

. Subject to the approval of the Board or a duly authorized Officer
 an Option or SAR may be transferred pursuant to the terms of a domestic relations order
 official marital settlement agreement or other divorce or separation instrument as permitted by Treasury Regulation 1.421-1(b)(2). If an Option is an Incentive Stock Option
 such Option may be deemed to be a Nonstatutory Stock Option as a result of such transfer.

. Subject to the approval of the Board or a duly authorized Officer
 a Participant may
 by delivering written notice to the Company
 in a form approved by the Company (or the designated broker)
 designate a third party who
 upon the death of the Participant
 will thereafter be entitled to exercise the Option or SAR and receive the Common Stock or other consideration resulting from such exercise. In the absence of such a designation
 upon the death of the Participant
 the executor or administrator of the Participant&rsquo;s estate will be entitled to exercise the Option or SAR and receive the Common Stock or other consideration resulting from such exercise. However
 the Company may prohibit designation of a beneficiary at any time
 including due to any conclusion by the Company that such designation would be inconsistent with the provisions of applicable laws.



 Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Stock Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant and the Company
 if a Participant&rsquo;s Continuous Service terminates (other than for Cause and other than upon the Participant&rsquo;s death or Disability)
 the Participant may exercise his or her Option or SAR (to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise such Stock Award as of the date of termination of Continuous Service) within the period of time ending on the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the date three&nbsp;months following the termination of the Participant&rsquo;s Continuous Service (or such longer or shorter period specified in the applicable Stock Award Agreement
 which period will not be less than 30&nbsp;days if necessary to comply with applicable laws unless such termination is for Cause) and (ii)&nbsp;the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the Stock Award Agreement. If
 after termination of Continuous Service
 the Participant does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the applicable time frame
 the Option or SAR (as applicable) will terminate.








 Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Stock Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant and the Company
 if the exercise of an Option or SAR following the termination of the Participant&rsquo;s Continuous Service (other than for Cause and other than upon the Participant&rsquo;s death or Disability) would be prohibited at any time solely because the issuance of shares of Common Stock would violate the registration requirements under the Securities Act
 then the Option or SAR will terminate on the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the expiration of a total period of time (that need not be consecutive) equal to the applicable post termination exercise period after the termination of the Participant&rsquo;s Continuous Service during which the exercise of the Option or SAR would not be in violation of such registration requirements
 or (ii)&nbsp;the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the applicable Stock Award Agreement. In addition
 unless otherwise provided in a Participant&rsquo;s Stock Award Agreement
 if the sale of any Common Stock received upon exercise of an Option or SAR following the termination of the Participant&rsquo;s Continuous Service (other than for Cause) would violate the Company&rsquo;s insider trading policy
 then the Option or SAR will terminate on the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the expiration of a period of time (that need not be consecutive) equal to the applicable post-termination exercise period after the termination of the Participant&rsquo;s Continuous Service during which the sale of the Common Stock received upon exercise of the Option or SAR would not be in violation of the Company&rsquo;s insider trading policy
 or (ii)&nbsp;the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the applicable Stock Award Agreement.

 Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Stock Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant and the Company
 if a Participant&rsquo;s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant&rsquo;s Disability
 the Participant may exercise his or her Option or SAR (to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise such Option or SAR as of the date of termination of Continuous Service)
 but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the date 12&nbsp;months following such termination of Continuous Service (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Stock Award Agreement
 which period will not be less than six&nbsp;months if necessary to comply with applicable laws)
 and (ii)&nbsp;the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the Stock Award Agreement. If
 after termination of Continuous Service
 the Participant does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the applicable time frame
 the Option or SAR (as applicable) will terminate.

 Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Stock Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant and the Company
 if (i) a Participant&rsquo;s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant&rsquo;s death
 or (ii) the Participant dies within the period (if any) specified in the Stock Award Agreement for exercisability after the termination of the Participant&rsquo;s Continuous Service (for a reason other than death)
 then the Option or SAR may be exercised (to the extent the Participant was entitled to exercise such Option or SAR as of the date of death) by the Participant&rsquo;s estate
 by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or SAR by bequest or inheritance or by a person designated to exercise the Option or SAR upon the Participant&rsquo;s death
18 months following the date of death (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Stock Award Agreement
 which period will not be less than six&nbsp;months if necessary to comply with applicable laws)
 and (ii)&nbsp;the expiration of the term of such Option or SAR as set forth in the Stock Award Agreement. If
 after the Participant&rsquo;s death









 the Option or SAR (as applicable) will terminate.

 Except as explicitly provided otherwise in a Participant&rsquo;s Stock Award Agreement or other individual written agreement between the Company or any Affiliate and the Participant
 if a Participant&rsquo;s Continuous Service is terminated for Cause
 the Option or SAR will terminate immediately upon such Participant&rsquo;s termination of Continuous Service
 and the Participant will be prohibited from exercising his or her Option or SAR from and after the time of such termination of Continuous Service.

. If an Option or SAR is granted to an Employee who is a non-exempt employee for purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938
 as amended
 the Option or SAR will not be first exercisable for any shares of Common Stock until at least six months following the date of grant of the Option or SAR (although the Stock Award may vest before such date). Consistent with the provisions of the Worker Economic Opportunity Act
 (i) if such non-exempt Employee dies or suffers a Disability
 (ii) upon a Corporate Transaction in which such Option or SAR is not assumed
 continued
 or substituted
 (iii) upon a Change in Control
 or (iv) upon the Participant&rsquo;s retirement (as such term may be defined in the Participant&rsquo;s Stock Award Agreement
 in another agreement between the Participant and the Company
 or
 if no such definition
 in accordance with the Company&#39;s then current employment policies and guidelines)
 the vested portion of any Options and SARs may be exercised earlier than six months following the date of grant. The foregoing provision is intended to operate so that any income derived by a non-exempt employee in connection with the exercise or vesting of an Option or SAR will be exempt from his or her regular rate of pay. To the extent permitted and/or required for compliance with the Worker Economic Opportunity Act to ensure that any income derived by a non-exempt employee in connection with the exercise
 vesting or issuance of any shares under any other Stock Award will be exempt from the employee&rsquo;s regular rate of pay
 the provisions of this Section 5(l) will apply to all Stock Awards and are hereby incorporated by reference into such Stock Award Agreements.

 An Option may
 but need not
 include a provision whereby the Optionholder may elect at any time before the Optionholder&rsquo;s Continuous Service terminates to exercise the Option as to any part or all of the shares of Common Stock subject to the Option before the full vesting of the Option. Subject to the &ldquo;Repurchase&nbsp;Limitation&rdquo; in Section&nbsp;8(l)
 any unvested shares of Common Stock so purchased may be subject to a repurchase right in favor of the Company or to any other restriction the Board determines to be appropriate. Provided that the &ldquo;Repurchase&nbsp;Limitation&rdquo; in Section&nbsp;8(l) is not violated
 the Company will not be required to exercise its repurchase right until at least six&nbsp;months (or such longer or shorter period of time required to avoid classification of the Option as a liability for financial accounting purposes) have elapsed following exercise of the Option unless the Board otherwise specifically provides in the Option Agreement.

. Subject to the &ldquo;Repurchase&nbsp;Limitation&rdquo; in Section&nbsp;8(l)
 the Option or SAR may include a provision whereby the Company may elect to repurchase all or any part of the vested shares of Common Stock acquired by the Participant pursuant to the exercise of the Option or SAR.








. The Option or SAR may include a provision whereby the Company may elect to exercise a right of first refusal following receipt of notice from the Participant of the intent to transfer all or any part of the shares of Common Stock received upon the exercise of the Option or SAR. Such right of first refusal will be subject to the &ldquo;Repurchase&nbsp;Limitation&rdquo; in Section&nbsp;8(l). Except as expressly provided in this Section&nbsp;5(o) or in the Stock Award Agreement
 such right of first refusal will otherwise comply with any applicable provisions of the bylaws of the Company.



 Each Restricted Stock Award Agreement will be in such form and will contain such terms and conditions as the Board deems appropriate. To the extent consistent with the Company&rsquo;s bylaws
 at the Board&rsquo;s election
 shares of Common Stock underlying a Restricted Stock Award may be (i)&nbsp;held in book entry form subject to the Company&rsquo;s instructions until any restrictions relating to the Restricted Stock Award lapse; or (ii)&nbsp;evidenced by a certificate
 which certificate will be held in such form and manner as determined by the Board. The terms and conditions of Restricted Stock Award Agreements may change from time to time
 and the terms and conditions of separate Restricted Stock Award Agreements need not be identical. Each Restricted Stock Award Agreement will conform to (through incorporation of the provisions hereof by reference in the agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions:

. A Restricted Stock Award may be awarded in consideration for (A)&nbsp;cash
 check
 bank draft or money order payable to the Company
 (B) past services to the Company or an Affiliate
(including future services) that may be acceptable to the Board
 in its sole discretion
 and permissible under applicable law.

. Subject to the &ldquo;Repurchase&nbsp;Limitation&rdquo; in Section&nbsp;8(l)
 shares of Common Stock awarded under the Restricted Stock Award Agreement may be subject to forfeiture to the Company in accordance with a vesting schedule to be determined by the Board.

. If a Participant&rsquo;s Continuous Service terminates
 the Company may receive through a forfeiture condition or a repurchase right
 any or all of the shares of Common Stock held by the Participant as of the date of termination of Continuous Service under the terms of the Restricted Stock Award Agreement.

. Rights to acquire shares of Common Stock under the Restricted Stock Award Agreement will be transferable by the Participant only upon such terms and conditions as are set forth in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement
 as the Board will determine in its sole discretion
 so long as Common Stock awarded under the Restricted Stock Award Agreement remains subject to the terms of the Restricted Stock Award Agreement.










Each Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement will be in such form and will contain such terms and conditions as the Board deems appropriate. The terms and conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements may change from time to time
 and the terms and conditions of separate Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements need not be identical. Each Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement will conform to (through incorporation of the provisions hereof by reference in the Agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions:

 At the time of grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award
 the Board will determine the consideration
 if any
 to be paid by the Participant upon delivery of each share of Common Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Unit Award. The consideration to be paid (if any) by the Participant for each share of Common Stock subject to a Restricted Stock Unit Award may be paid in any form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board
 in its sole discretion
 and permissible under applicable law.

At the time of the grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award
 the Board may impose such restrictions on or conditions to the vesting of the Restricted Stock Unit Award as it
 in its sole discretion
 deems appropriate.

. A Restricted Stock Unit Award may be settled by the delivery of shares of Common Stock
 their cash equivalent
 any combination thereof or in any other form of consideration
 as determined by the Board and contained in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement.

At the time of the grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award
 the Board
 as it deems appropriate
 may impose such restrictions or conditions that delay the delivery of the shares of Common Stock (or their cash equivalent) subject to a Restricted Stock Unit Award to a time after the vesting of such Restricted Stock Unit Award.

Dividend equivalents may be credited in respect of shares of Common Stock covered by a Restricted Stock Unit Award
 as determined by the Board and contained in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement. At the sole discretion of the Board
 such dividend equivalents may be converted into additional shares of Common Stock covered by the Restricted Stock Unit Award in such manner as determined by the Board. Any additional shares covered by the Restricted Stock Unit Award credited by reason of such dividend equivalents will be subject to all of the same terms and conditions of the underlying Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement to which they relate.

Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement
 such portion of the Restricted Stock Unit Award that has not vested will be forfeited upon the Participant&rsquo;s termination of Continuous Service.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein
 any Restricted Stock Unit Award granted under the Plan that is not exempt from the requirements of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code shall contain such provisions so that such Restricted Stock Unit Award will comply with the requirements of Section&nbsp;409A of the








 if any
 shall be determined by the Board and contained in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement evidencing such Restricted Stock Unit Award. For example
 such restrictions may include
 without limitation
 a requirement that any Common Stock that is to be issued in a year following the year in which the Restricted Stock Unit Award vests must be issued in accordance with a fixed pre-determined schedule.

. Other forms of Stock Awards valued in whole or in part by reference to
 or otherwise based on
 Common Stock
 including the appreciation in value thereof (e.g.
 options or stock rights with an exercise price or strike price less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock at the time of grant) may be granted either alone or in addition to Stock Awards provided for under Section 5 and the preceding provisions of this Section 6. Subject to the provisions of the Plan
 the Board will have sole and complete authority to determine the persons to whom and the time or times at which such Other Stock Awards will be granted
 the number of shares of Common Stock (or the cash equivalent thereof) to be granted pursuant to such Other Stock Awards and all other terms and conditions of such Other Stock Awards.





provided
 however

 any Stock Award or any Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Stock Award. If
 after reasonable efforts and at a reasonable cost
 the Company is unable to obtain from any such regulatory commission or agency the authority that counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of Common Stock under the Plan
 the Company will be relieved from any liability for failure to issue and sell Common Stock upon exercise of such Stock Awards unless and until such authority is obtained. A Participant will not be eligible for the grant of a Stock Award or the subsequent issuance of cash or Common Stock pursuant to the Stock Award if such grant or issuance would be in violation of any applicable securities law.

The Company will have no duty or obligation to any Participant to advise such holder as to the time or manner of exercising such Stock Award. Furthermore
 the Company will have no duty or obligation to warn or otherwise advise such holder of a pending termination or expiration of a Stock Award or a possible period in which the Stock Award may not be exercised. The Company has no duty or obligation to minimize the tax consequences of a Stock Award to the holder of such Stock Award.












 Corporate action constituting a grant by the Company of a Stock Award to any Participant will be deemed completed as of the date of such corporate action
 unless otherwise determined by the Board
 regardless of when the instrument
 certificate
 or letter evidencing the Stock Award is communicated to
 or actually received or accepted by
 the Participant. In the event that the corporate records (e.g.
 Board consents
 resolutions or minutes) documenting the corporate action constituting the grant contain terms (e.g.
 exercise price
 vesting schedule or number of shares) that are inconsistent with those in the Stock Award Agreement as a result of a clerical error in the papering of the Stock Award Agreement
 the corporate records will control and the Participant will have no legally binding right to the incorrect term in the Stock Award Agreement.

 No Participant will be deemed to be the holder of
 or to have any of the rights of a holder with respect to
 any shares of Common Stock subject to a Stock Award unless and until (i)&nbsp;such Participant has satisfied all requirements for exercise of
 or the issuance of shares of Common Stock under
 the Stock Award pursuant to its terms
 and (ii)&nbsp;the issuance of the Common Stock subject to the Stock Award has been entered into the books and records of the Company.

 Nothing in the Plan
 any Stock Award Agreement or any other instrument executed thereunder or in connection with any Stock Award granted pursuant thereto will confer upon any Participant any right to continue to serve the Company or an Affiliate in the capacity in effect at the time the Stock Award was granted or will affect the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate (i)&nbsp;the employment of an Employee with or without notice and with or without cause
 (ii)&nbsp;the service of a Consultant pursuant to the terms of such Consultant&rsquo;s agreement with the Company or an Affiliate
 or (iii)&nbsp;the service of a Director pursuant to the bylaws of the Company or an Affiliate
 and any applicable provisions of the corporate law of the state in which the Company or the Affiliate is incorporated
 as the case may be.

. In the event a Participant&rsquo;s regular level of time commitment in the performance of his or her services for the Company and any Affiliates is reduced (for example
 and without limitation
 if the Participant is an Employee of the Company and the Employee has a change in status from a full-time Employee to a part-time Employee) after the date of grant of any Stock Award to the Participant
 the Board has the right in its sole discretion to (x) make a corresponding reduction in the number of shares subject to any portion of such Stock Award that is scheduled to vest or become payable after the date of such change in time commitment
 and (y) in lieu of or in combination with such a reduction
 extend the vesting or payment schedule applicable to such Stock Award. In the event of any such reduction
 the Participant will have no right with respect to any portion of the Stock Award that is so reduced or extended.







 To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the time of grant) of Common Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Optionholder during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Affiliates) exceeds $100
000 (or such other limit established in the Code) or otherwise does not comply with the rules governing Incentive Stock Options
 the Options or portions thereof that exceed such limit (according to the order in which they were granted) or otherwise do not comply with such rules will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options
 notwithstanding any contrary provision of the applicable Option Agreement(s).

 The Company may require a Participant
 as a condition of exercising or acquiring Common Stock under any Stock Award
 (i)&nbsp;to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company as to the Participant&rsquo;s knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and/or to employ a purchaser representative reasonably satisfactory to the Company who is knowledgeable and experienced in financial and business matters and that he or she is capable of evaluating
 alone or together with the purchaser representative
 the merits and risks of exercising the Stock Award; and (ii)&nbsp;to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company stating that the Participant is acquiring Common Stock subject to the Stock Award for the Participant&rsquo;s own account and not with any present intention of selling or otherwise distributing the Common Stock. The foregoing requirements
 and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements
 will be inoperative if (A)&nbsp;the issuance of the shares upon the exercise or acquisition of Common Stock under the Stock Award has been registered under a then currently effective registration statement under the Securities Act
 or (B)&nbsp;as to any particular requirement
 a determination is made by counsel for the Company that such requirement need not be met in the circumstances under the then applicable securities laws. The Company may
 upon advice of counsel to the Company
 place legends on stock certificates issued under the Plan as such counsel deems necessary or appropriate in order to comply with applicable securities laws
 including
 but not limited to
 legends restricting the transfer of the Common Stock.

 Unless prohibited by the terms of a Stock Award Agreement
 the Company may
 in its sole discretion
 satisfy any federal

 however
 that no shares of Common Stock are withheld with a value exceeding the minimum amount of tax required to be withheld by law (or such lesser amount as may be necessary to avoid classification of the Stock Award as a liability for financial accounting purposes); (iii)&nbsp;withholding cash from a Stock Award settled in cash; (iv) withholding payment from any amounts otherwise payable to the Participant; or (v)&nbsp;by such other method as may be set forth in the Stock Award Agreement.









 To the extent permitted by applicable law
 the Board
 in its sole discretion
 may determine that the delivery of Common Stock or the payment of cash
 upon the exercise
 vesting or settlement of all or a portion of any Stock Award may be deferred and may establish programs and procedures for deferral elections to be made by Participants. Deferrals by Participants will be made in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. Consistent with Section 409A of the Code
 the Board may provide for distributions while a Participant is still an employee or otherwise providing services to the Company. The Board is authorized to make deferrals of Stock Awards and determine when
 and in what annual percentages
 Participants may receive payments
 including lump sum payments
 following the Participant&rsquo;s termination of Continuous Service
 and implement such other terms and conditions consistent with the provisions of the Plan and in accordance with applicable law.

To the extent that the Board determines that any Stock Award granted hereunder is subject to Section&nbsp;409A of the Code
 the Stock Award Agreement evidencing such Stock Award shall incorporate the terms and conditions necessary to avoid the consequences specified in Section&nbsp;409A(a)(1) of the Code. To the extent applicable
 the Plan and Stock Award Agreements shall be interpreted in accordance with Section&nbsp;409A of the Code.

. The terms of any repurchase right will be specified in the Stock Award Agreement. The repurchase price for vested shares of Common Stock will be the Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock on the date of repurchase. The repurchase price for unvested shares of Common Stock will be the lower of (i)&nbsp;the Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock on the date of repurchase or (ii)&nbsp;their original purchase price. However
 the Company will not exercise its repurchase right until at least six&nbsp;months (or such longer or shorter period of time necessary to avoid classification of the Stock Award as a liability for financial accounting purposes) have elapsed following delivery of shares of Common Stock subject to the Stock Award
 unless otherwise specifically provided by the Board.



. In the event of a Capitalization Adjustment
 the Board will appropriately and proportionately adjust: (i)&nbsp;the class(es) and maximum number of securities subject to the Plan pursuant to Section&nbsp;3(a)
 (ii)&nbsp;the class(es) and maximum number of securities that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options pursuant to Section&nbsp;3(c)
 and (iii)&nbsp;the class(es) and number of securities and price per share of stock subject to outstanding Stock Awards. The Board will make such adjustments
 and its determination will be final
 binding and conclusive.

. Except as otherwise provided in the Stock Award Agreement
 in the event of a Dissolution of the Company
 all outstanding Stock Awards (other than Stock Awards consisting of vested and outstanding shares of Common Stock not subject to a forfeiture condition or the Company&rsquo;s right of repurchase) will terminate immediately before the completion of such Dissolution
 and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Company&rsquo;s repurchase rights or subject to a forfeiture condition may be repurchased or reacquired by the Company notwithstanding the fact that the holder of such Stock Award is providing Continuous Service

 however

 in its sole discretion
 cause some or all Stock








 exercisable and/or no longer subject to repurchase or forfeiture (to the extent such Stock Awards have not previously expired or terminated) before the Dissolution is completed but contingent on its completion.

 The following provisions will apply to Stock Awards in the event of a Transaction unless otherwise provided in the Stock Award Agreement or any other written agreement between the Company or any Affiliate and the Participant or unless otherwise expressly provided by the Board at the time of grant of a Stock Award. In the event of a Transaction
 then
 notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan
 the Board may take one or more of the following actions with respect to Stock Awards
 contingent upon the closing or completion of the Transaction:

&nbsp;arrange for the surviving corporation or acquiring corporation (or the surviving or acquiring corporation&rsquo;s parent company) to assume or continue the Stock Award or to substitute a similar stock award for the Stock Award (including
 but not limited to
 an award to acquire the same consideration paid to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Transaction);



&nbsp;accelerate the vesting
 in whole or in part
 of the Stock Award (and
 if applicable
 the time at which the Stock Award may be exercised) to a date before the effective time of such Transaction as the Board determines (or
 if the Board does not determine such a date
 to the date that is five&nbsp;days before the effective date of the Transaction)
 with such Stock Award terminating if not exercised (if applicable) at or before the effective time of the Transaction; provided
 however
 that the Board may require Participants to complete and deliver to the Company a notice of exercise before the effective date of a Transaction
 which exercise is contingent upon the effectiveness of such Transaction;

&nbsp;arrange for the lapse
 in whole or in part
 of any reacquisition or repurchase rights held by the Company with respect to the Stock Award;

&nbsp;cancel or arrange for the cancellation of the Stock Award
 to the extent not vested or not exercised before the effective time of the Transaction
 in exchange for such cash consideration
 if any
 as the Board
 in its sole discretion
 may consider appropriate; and

&nbsp;make a payment
 in such form as may be determined by the Board equal to the excess
 if any
 of (A)&nbsp;the value of the property the Participant would have received upon the exercise of the Stock Award immediately before the effective time of the Transaction
 over (B)&nbsp;any exercise price payable by such holder in connection with such exercise. For clarity
 this payment may be zero ($0) if the value of the property is equal to or less than the exercise price. Payments under this provision may be delayed to the same extent that payment of consideration to the holders of the Company&rsquo;s Common Stock in connection with the Transaction is delayed as a result of escrows
 earn outs
 holdbacks or any other contingencies.









 A Stock Award may be subject to additional acceleration of vesting and exercisability upon or after a Change in Control as may be provided in the Stock Award Agreement for such Stock Award or as may be provided in any other written agreement between the Company or any Affiliate and the Participant
 but in the absence of such provision
 no such acceleration will occur.



 The Board may suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. Unless terminated sooner by the Board
 the Plan will automatically terminate on the day before the 10th anniversary of the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the date the Plan is adopted by the Board
 or (ii)&nbsp;the date the Plan is approved by the stockholders of the Company. No Stock Awards may be granted under the Plan while the Plan is suspended or after it is terminated.

 without regard to that state&rsquo;s conflict of laws rules.

As used in the Plan
 the following definitions will apply to the capitalized terms indicated below:

&rdquo; means
 at the time of determination
 any &ldquo;parent&rdquo; or &ldquo;majority-owned subsidiary&rdquo; of the Company
 as such terms are defined in Rule&nbsp;405. The Board will have the authority to determine the time or times at which &ldquo;parent&rdquo; or &ldquo;majority-owned subsidiary&rdquo; status is determined within the foregoing definition.



&rdquo; means any change that is made in
 or other events that occur with respect to
 the Common Stock subject to the Plan or subject to any Stock Award after the Effective Date without the receipt of consideration by the Company through merger

 dividend in property other than cash
 large nonrecurring cash dividend
 stock split
 reverse stock split
 liquidating dividend
 combination of shares
 exchange of shares
 change in corporate structure
 or any similar equity restructuring transaction
 as that term is used in Statement of Financial








 the conversion of any convertible securities of the Company will not be treated as a Capitalization Adjustment.

will have the meaning ascribed to such term in any written agreement between the Participant and the Company defining such term and
 in the absence of such agreement
 such term means
 with respect to a Participant
 the occurrence of any of the following events: (i)&nbsp;such Participant&rsquo;s commission of any felony or any crime involving fraud
 dishonesty or moral turpitude under the laws of the United States or any state thereof; (ii) such Participant&rsquo;s attempted commission of
 or participation in
 a fraud or act of dishonesty against the Company; (iii)&nbsp;such Participant&rsquo;s intentional
 material violation of any contract or agreement between the Participant and the Company or of any statutory duty owed to the Company; (iv)&nbsp;such Participant&rsquo;s unauthorized use or disclosure of the Company&rsquo;s confidential information or trade secrets; or (v)&nbsp;such Participant&rsquo;s gross misconduct. The determination that a termination of the Participant&rsquo;s Continuous Service is either for Cause or without Cause will be made by the Company
 in its sole discretion. Any determination by the Company that the Continuous Service of a Participant was terminated with or without Cause for the purposes of outstanding Stock Awards held by such Participant will have no effect upon any determination of the rights or obligations of the Company or such Participant for any other purpose.

&rdquo; means the occurrence
 in a single transaction or in a series of related transactions
 of any one or more of the following events:

&nbsp;any Exchange Act Person becomes the Owner
 directly or indirectly
 of securities of the Company representing more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company&rsquo;s then outstanding securities other than by virtue of a merger
 consolidation or similar transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 a Change in Control will not be deemed to occur (A)&nbsp;on account of the acquisition of securities of the Company directly from the Company
 (B) on account of the acquisition of securities of the Company by an investor
&rdquo;) exceeds the designated percentage threshold of the outstanding voting securities as a result of a repurchase or other acquisition of voting securities by the Company reducing the number of shares outstanding
 provided that if a Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this sentence) as a result of the acquisition of voting securities by the Company
 and after such share acquisition
 the Subject Person becomes the Owner of any additional voting securities that

 Employees
 Directors and Consultants are eligible to receive Stock Awards.

 The Plan provides for the grant of the following types of Stock Awards: (i)&nbsp;Incentive Stock Options
 (ii)&nbsp;Nonstatutory Stock Options
 (iii) Stock Appreciation Rights
 (iv) Restricted Stock Awards
 (v) Restricted Stock Unit Awards and (vi) Other Stock Awards.

 The Plan
 through the granting of Stock Awards
 is intended to help the Company secure and retain the services of eligible award recipients
 provide incentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company and any Affiliate and provide a means by which the eligible recipients may benefit from increases in value of the Series B Preferred Stock.



 The Board will administer the Plan. The Board may delegate administration of the Plan to a Committee or Committees
 as provided in Section 2(c).

 The Board will have the power
 subject to
 and within the limitations of
 the express provisions of the Plan:

&nbsp;To determine (A) who will be granted Stock Awards; (B) when and how each Stock Award will be granted; (C) what type of Stock Award will be granted; (D) the provisions of each Stock Award (which need not be identical)
 including when a person will be permitted to exercise or otherwise receive cash or Series B Preferred Stock under the Stock Award; (E) the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock subject to a Stock Award; and (F) the Fair Market Value applicable to a Stock Award.

To construe and interpret the Plan and Stock Awards granted under it
 and to establish
 amend and revoke rules and regulations for administration of the Plan and Stock Awards. The Board
 in the exercise of these powers
 may correct any defect
 omission or inconsistency in the Plan or in any Stock Award Agreement
 in a manner and to the extent it will deem necessary or expedient to make the Plan or Stock Award fully effective.









&nbsp;To accelerate
 in whole or in part
 the time at which a Stock Award may be exercised or vest (or at which cash or shares of Series B Preferred Stock may be issued).

&nbsp;To suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or a Stock Award Agreement
 suspension or termination of the Plan will not impair a Participant&rsquo;s rights under his or her then-outstanding Stock Award without his or her written consent except as provided in subsection (viii) below.

&nbsp;To amend the Plan in any respect the Board deems necessary or advisable
 including
 without limitation
 by adopting amendments relating to Incentive Stock Options and certain nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code and/or to make the Plan or Stock Awards granted under the Plan compliant with the requirements for Incentive Stock Options or exempt from or compliant with the requirements for nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code
 subject to the limitations
 if any
 of applicable law. However
 if required by applicable law
 and except as provided in Section&nbsp;9(a) relating to Capitalization Adjustments
 the Company will seek stockholder approval of any amendment of the Plan that (A)&nbsp;materially increases the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock available for issuance under the Plan
 (B)&nbsp;materially expands the class of individuals eligible to receive Stock Awards under the Plan
 (C)&nbsp;materially increases the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan
 (D) materially reduces the price at which shares of Series B Preferred Stock may be issued or purchased under the Plan
 (E)&nbsp;materially extends the term of the Plan
 or (F)&nbsp;materially expands the types of Stock Awards available for issuance under the Plan. Except as provided in the Plan (including subsection (viii) below) or a Stock Award Agreement
 no amendment of the Plan will impair a Participant&rsquo;s rights under an outstanding Stock Award unless (1) the Company requests the consent of the affected Participant
 and (2) such Participant consents in writing.

&nbsp;To submit any amendment to the Plan for stockholder approval
 including
 but not limited to
 amendments to the Plan intended to satisfy the requirements of Section&nbsp;422 of the Code regarding Incentive Stock Options.

To approve forms of Stock Award Agreements for use under the Plan and to amend the terms of any one or more Stock Awards
 including
 but not limited to
 amendments to provide terms more favorable to the Participant than previously provided in the Stock Award Agreement


 and (B)&nbsp;such Participant consents in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 (1) a Participant&rsquo;s rights will not be deemed to have been impaired by any such amendment if the Board
 in its sole discretion
 determines that the amendment
 taken as a whole
 does not materially impair the Participant&rsquo;s rights
 and (2) subject to the limitations of applicable law
 if any
 the Board may amend the terms of any one or more Stock Awards without the affected Participant&rsquo;s consent (A)&nbsp;to maintain the qualified status of the Stock Award as an Incentive Stock Option under Section 422 of the Code; (B) to change the terms of an Incentive Stock Option
 if such change results in impairment of the Award solely because it impairs the qualified status of the Award as an Incentive Stock Option under Section 422 of the Code; (C) to clarify the manner of exemption from
 or to bring the Stock Award into compliance with
 Section 409A of the Code; or (D) to comply with other applicable laws.







&nbsp;Generally
 to exercise such powers and to perform such acts as the Board deems necessary or expedient to promote the best interests of the Company and that are not in conflict with the provisions of the Plan or Stock Awards.

&nbsp;To adopt such procedures and sub-plans as are necessary or appropriate to permit participation in the Plan by Employees
 Directors or Consultants who are foreign nationals or employed outside the United States (provided that Board approval will not be necessary for immaterial modifications to the Plan or any Stock Award Agreement that are required for compliance with the laws of the relevant foreign jurisdiction).

&nbsp;To effect
 with the consent of any adversely affected Participant
 (A) the reduction of the exercise
 purchase or strike price of any outstanding Stock Award; (B) the cancellation of any outstanding Stock Award and the grant in substitution therefor of a new (1) Option or SAR
 (2) Restricted Stock Award
 (3) Restricted Stock Unit Award
 (4) Other Stock Award
 (5) cash and/or (6) other valuable consideration determined by the Board
 in its sole discretion
 with any such substituted award (x) covering the same or a different number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock as the cancelled Stock Award and (y) granted under the Plan or another equity or compensatory plan of the Company; or (C) any other action that is treated as a repricing under generally accepted accounting principles.

 The Board may delegate some or all of the administration of the Plan to a Committee or Committees. If administration of the Plan is delegated to a Committee
 the Committee will have
 in connection with the administration of the Plan
 the powers theretofore possessed by the Board that have been delegated to the Committee
 including the power to delegate to a subcommittee of the Committee any of the administrative powers the Committee is authorized to exercise (and references in this Plan to the Board will thereafter be to the Committee or subcommittee). Any delegation of administrative powers will be reflected in resolutions
 not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan
 adopted from time to time by the Board or Committee (as applicable). The Committee may
 at any time
 abolish the subcommittee and/or revest in the Committee any powers delegated to the subcommittee. The Board may retain the authority to concurrently administer the Plan with the Committee and may
 at any time
 revest in the Board some or all of the powers previously delegated.

 The Board may delegate to one (1) or more Officers the authority to do one or both of the following: (i) designate Employees who are not Officers to be recipients of Options and SARs (and
 to the extent permitted by applicable law
 other Stock Awards) and
 to the extent permitted by applicable law
 the terms of such Stock Awards
 and (ii) determine the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be subject to such Stock Awards granted to such Employees; provided
 however
 that the Board resolutions regarding such delegation will specify the total number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that may be subject to the Stock Awards granted by such Officer and that such Officer may not grant a Stock Award to himself or herself. Any such Stock Awards will be granted on the form of Stock Award Agreement most recently approved for use by the Committee or the Board
 unless otherwise provided in the resolutions approving the delegation authority. The Board may not delegate authority to an Officer who is acting solely in the capacity of an Officer (and not also as a Director) to determine the Fair Market Value pursuant to Section&nbsp;13(u) below.







 All determinations
 interpretations and constructions made by the Board in good faith will not be subject to review by any person and will be final
 binding and conclusive on all persons.






&rdquo;). For clarity
 the Share Reserve in this Section&nbsp;3(a) is a limitation on the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that may be issued pursuant to the Plan. Accordingly
 this Section 3(a) does not limit the granting of Stock Awards except as provided in Section&nbsp;7(a).


 the Participant receives cash rather than stock)
 such expiration
 termination or settlement will not reduce (or otherwise offset) the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that may be available for issuance under the Plan. If any shares of Series B Preferred Stock issued pursuant to a Stock Award are forfeited back to or repurchased by the Company because of the failure to meet a contingency or condition required to vest such shares in the Participant
 then the shares that are forfeited or repurchased will revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan. Any shares reacquired by the Company in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations on a Stock Award or as consideration for the exercise or purchase price of a Stock Award will again become available for issuance under the Plan.

Subject to the Share Reserve and Section&nbsp;9(a) relating to Capitalization Adjustments
 the aggregate maximum number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options will be 87 shares of Series B Preferred Stock.

 The stock issuable under the Plan will be shares of authorized but unissued or reacquired Series B Preferred Stock
 including shares repurchased by the Company on the open market or otherwise.



. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to employees of the Company or a &ldquo;parent corporation&rdquo; or &ldquo;subsidiary corporation&rdquo; thereof (as such terms are defined in Sections&nbsp;424(e) and 424(f) of the Code). Stock Awards other than Incentive Stock Options may be granted to Employees

 however
 that Stock Awards may not be granted to Employees
 Directors and Consultants who are providing Continuous Service only to any &ldquo;parent&rdquo; of the Company
 as such term is defined in Rule&nbsp;405
 unless (i) the stock underlying such Stock Awards is treated as &ldquo;service recipient stock&rdquo; under Section 409A of the Code (for example
 because the Stock Awards are granted pursuant to a corporate transaction such as a spin off transaction)
 or (ii) the Company
 in








 has determined that such Stock Awards are otherwise exempt from or alternatively comply with the distribution requirements of Section 409A of the Code.



A Consultant will not be eligible for the grant of a Stock Award if
 at the time of grant
 either the offer or sale of the Company&rsquo;s securities to such Consultant is not exempt under Rule&nbsp;701 because of the nature of the services that the Consultant is providing to the Company
 because the Consultant is not a natural person
 or because of any other provision of Rule&nbsp;701
 unless the Company determines that such grant need not comply with the requirements of Rule&nbsp;701 and will satisfy another exemption under the Securities Act as well as comply with the securities laws of all other relevant jurisdictions




 and
 if certificates are issued
 a separate certificate or certificates will be issued for shares of Series B Preferred Stock purchased on exercise of each type of Option. If an Option is not specifically designated as an Incentive Stock Option
 or if an Option is designated as an Incentive Stock Option but some portion or all of the Option fails to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option under the applicable rules

 however
 that each Stock Award Agreement will conform to (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the applicable Stock Award Agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions:

 Subject to the provisions of Section&nbsp;4(b) regarding Ten Percent Stockholders
 no Option or SAR will be exercisable after the expiration of 10 years from the date of its grant or such shorter period specified in the Stock Award Agreement.

 Subject to the provisions of Section&nbsp;4(b) regarding Ten Percent Stockholders
 the exercise or strike price of each Option or SAR will be not less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Series B Preferred Stock subject to the Option or SAR on the date the Stock Award is granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 an Option or SAR may be granted with an exercise or strike price lower than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Series B Preferred Stock subject to the Stock Award if such Stock Award is granted pursuant to an assumption of or substitution for another option or stock appreciation right pursuant to a Corporate Transaction and in a manner consistent with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and
 if applicable
 Section 424(a) of the Code. Each SAR will be denominated in shares of Series B Preferred Stock equivalents.

 The purchase price of Series B Preferred Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option may be paid
 to the extent permitted by applicable








 by any combination of the methods of payment set forth below. The Board will have the authority to grant Options that do not permit all of the following methods of payment (or otherwise restrict the ability to use certain methods) and to grant Options that require the consent of the Company to use a particular method of payment. The permitted methods of payment are as follows:

by cash
 check
 bank draft or money order payable to the Company;

&nbsp;pursuant to a program developed under Regulation&nbsp;T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board that
 before the issuance of the stock subject to the Option
 results in either the receipt of cash (or check) by the Company or the receipt of irrevocable instructions to pay the aggregate exercise price to the Company from the sales proceeds;



&nbsp;if an Option is a Nonstatutory Stock Option
 by a &ldquo;net exercise&rdquo; arrangement pursuant to which the Company will reduce the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise by the largest whole number of shares with a Fair Market Value that does not exceed the aggregate exercise price; provided
 however
 that the Company will accept a cash or other payment from the Participant to the extent of any remaining balance of the aggregate exercise price not satisfied by such reduction in the number of whole shares to be issued. Shares of Series B Preferred Stock will no longer be subject to an Option and will not be exercisable thereafter to the extent that (A) shares issuable upon exercise are used to pay the exercise price pursuant to the &ldquo;net exercise
&rdquo; (B) shares are delivered to the Participant as a result of such exercise
 and (C) shares are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations; or



 To exercise any outstanding SAR
 the Participant must provide written notice of exercise to the Company in compliance with the provisions of the Stock Award Agreement evidencing such SAR. The appreciation distribution payable on the exercise of a SAR will be not greater than an amount equal to the excess of (A)&nbsp;the aggregate Fair Market Value (on the date of the exercise of the SAR) of a number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock equal to the number of Series B Preferred Stock equivalents in which the Participant is vested under such SAR
 and with respect to which the Participant is exercising the SAR on such date
 over (B) the aggregate strike price of the number of Series B Preferred Stock equivalents with respect to which the Participant is exercising the SAR on such date. The appreciation distribution may be paid in Series B Preferred Stock
 in cash
 in any combination of the two or in any other form of consideration
 as determined by the Board and contained in the Stock Award Agreement evidencing such SAR.

 The Board may
 in its sole discretion
 impose such limitations on the transferability of Options and SARs as the Board will determine. In the absence of such a determination by the Board to the contrary
 the following restrictions on the transferability of Options and SARs will apply:







. An Option or SAR will not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution (and pursuant to subsections (ii) and (iii) below)
 and will be exercisable during the lifetime of the Participant only by the Participant. The Board may permit transfer of the Option or SAR in a manner that is not prohibited by applicable tax and securities laws. Except as explicitly provided herein
 neither an Option nor a SAR may be transferred for consideration.

. Subject to the approval of the Board or a duly authorized Officer
 an Option or SAR may be transferred pursuant to the terms of a domestic relations order
 official marital settlement agreement or other divorce or separation instrument as permitted by Treasury Regulation 1.421-1(b)(2). If an Option is an Incentive Stock Option
 such Option may be deemed to be a Nonstatutory Stock Option as a result of such transfer.

. Subject to the approval of the Board or a duly authorized Officer
 a Participant may
 by delivering written notice to the Company
 in a form approved by the Company (or the designated broker)
 designate a third party who
 upon the death of the Participant
 will thereafter be entitled to exercise the Option or SAR and receive the Series B Preferred Stock or other consideration resulting from such exercise. In the absence of such a designation
 upon the death of the Participant
 the executor or administrator of the Participant&rsquo;s estate will be entitled to exercise the Option or SAR and receive the Series B Preferred Stock or other consideration resulting from such exercise. However
 the Company may prohibit designation of a beneficiary at any time
 including due to any conclusion by the Company that such designation would be inconsistent with the provisions of applicable laws.



 Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Stock Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant and the Company
 if a Participant&rsquo;s Continuous Service terminates (other than for Cause and other than upon the Participant&rsquo;s death or Disability)
 the Participant may exercise his or her Option or SAR (to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise such Stock Award as of the date of termination of Continuous Service) within the period of time ending on the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the date three&nbsp;months following the termination of the Participant&rsquo;s Continuous Service (or such longer or shorter period specified in the applicable Stock Award Agreement
 which period will not be less than 30&nbsp;days if necessary to comply with applicable laws unless such termination is for Cause) and (ii)&nbsp;the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the Stock Award Agreement. If
 after termination of Continuous Service
 the Participant does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the applicable time frame
 the Option or SAR (as applicable) will terminate.







 Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Stock Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant and the Company
 if the exercise of an Option or SAR following the termination of the Participant&rsquo;s Continuous Service (other than for Cause and other than upon the Participant&rsquo;s death or Disability) would be prohibited at any time solely because the issuance of shares of Series B Preferred Stock would violate the registration requirements under the Securities Act
 then the Option or SAR will terminate on the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the expiration of a total period of time (that need not be consecutive) equal to the applicable post termination exercise period after the termination of the Participant&rsquo;s Continuous Service during which the exercise of the Option or SAR would not be in violation of such registration requirements
 or (ii)&nbsp;the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the applicable Stock Award Agreement. In addition
 unless otherwise provided in a Participant&rsquo;s Stock Award Agreement
 if the sale of any Series B Preferred Stock received upon exercise of an Option or SAR following the termination of the Participant&rsquo;s Continuous Service (other than for Cause) would violate the Company&rsquo;s insider trading policy
 then the Option or SAR will terminate on the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the expiration of a period of time (that need not be consecutive) equal to the applicable post-termination exercise period after the termination of the Participant&rsquo;s Continuous Service during which the sale of the Series B Preferred Stock received upon exercise of the Option or SAR would not be in violation of the Company&rsquo;s insider trading policy
 or (ii)&nbsp;the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the applicable Stock Award Agreement.

 Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Stock Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant and the Company
 if a Participant&rsquo;s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant&rsquo;s Disability
 the Participant may exercise his or her Option or SAR (to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise such Option or SAR as of the date of termination of Continuous Service)
 but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the date 12&nbsp;months following such termination of Continuous Service (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Stock Award Agreement
 which period will not be less than six&nbsp;months if necessary to comply with applicable laws)
 and (ii)&nbsp;the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the Stock Award Agreement. If
 after termination of Continuous Service
 the Participant does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the applicable time frame
 the Option or SAR (as applicable) will terminate.

 Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Stock Award Agreement or other agreement between the Participant and the Company
 if (i) a Participant&rsquo;s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant&rsquo;s death
 or (ii) the Participant dies within the period (if any) specified in the Stock Award Agreement for exercisability after the termination of the Participant&rsquo;s Continuous Service (for a reason other than death)
 then the Option or SAR may be exercised (to the extent the Participant was entitled to exercise such Option or SAR as of the date of death) by the Participant&rsquo;s estate
 by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or SAR by bequest or inheritance or by a person designated to exercise the Option or SAR upon the Participant&rsquo;s death
18 months following the date of death (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Stock Award Agreement
 which period will not be less than six&nbsp;months if necessary to comply with applicable laws)
 and (ii)&nbsp;the expiration of the term of such Option or SAR as set forth in the Stock Award Agreement. If
 after the Participant&rsquo;s death









 the Option or SAR (as applicable) will terminate.

 Except as explicitly provided otherwise in a Participant&rsquo;s Stock Award Agreement or other individual written agreement between the Company or any Affiliate and the Participant
 if a Participant&rsquo;s Continuous Service is terminated for Cause
 the Option or SAR will terminate immediately upon such Participant&rsquo;s termination of Continuous Service
 and the Participant will be prohibited from exercising his or her Option or SAR from and after the time of such termination of Continuous Service.

. If an Option or SAR is granted to an Employee who is a non-exempt employee for purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938
 as amended
 the Option or SAR will not be first exercisable for any shares of Series B Preferred Stock until at least six months following the date of grant of the Option or SAR (although the Stock Award may vest before such date). Consistent with the provisions of the Worker Economic Opportunity Act
 (i) if such non-exempt Employee dies or suffers a Disability
 (ii) upon a Corporate Transaction in which such Option or SAR is not assumed
 continued
 or substituted
 (iii) upon a Change in Control
 or (iv) upon the Participant&rsquo;s retirement (as such term may be defined in the Participant&rsquo;s Stock Award Agreement
 in another agreement between the Participant and the Company
 or
 if no such definition
 in accordance with the Company&#39;s then current employment policies and guidelines)
 the vested portion of any Options and SARs may be exercised earlier than six months following the date of grant. The foregoing provision is intended to operate so that any income derived by a non-exempt employee in connection with the exercise or vesting of an Option or SAR will be exempt from his or her regular rate of pay. To the extent permitted and/or required for compliance with the Worker Economic Opportunity Act to ensure that any income derived by a non-exempt employee in connection with the exercise
 vesting or issuance of any shares under any other Stock Award will be exempt from the employee&rsquo;s regular rate of pay
 the provisions of this Section 5(l) will apply to all Stock Awards and are hereby incorporated by reference into such Stock Award Agreements.

 An Option may
 but need not
 include a provision whereby the Optionholder may elect at any time before the Optionholder&rsquo;s Continuous Service terminates to exercise the Option as to any part or all of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock subject to the Option before the full vesting of the Option. Subject to the &ldquo;Repurchase&nbsp;Limitation&rdquo; in Section&nbsp;8(l)
 any unvested shares of Series B Preferred Stock so purchased may be subject to a repurchase right in favor of the Company or to any other restriction the Board determines to be appropriate. Provided that the &ldquo;Repurchase&nbsp;Limitation&rdquo; in Section&nbsp;8(l) is not violated

 at the Board&rsquo;s election
 shares of Series B Preferred Stock underlying a Restricted Stock Award may be (i)&nbsp;held in book entry form subject to the Company&rsquo;s instructions until any restrictions relating to the Restricted Stock Award lapse; or (ii)&nbsp;evidenced by a certificate
 which certificate will be held in such form and manner as determined by the Board. The terms and conditions of Restricted Stock Award Agreements may change from time to time
 and the terms and conditions of separate Restricted Stock Award Agreements need not be identical. Each Restricted Stock Award Agreement will conform to (through incorporation of the provisions hereof by reference in the agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions:

. A Restricted Stock Award may be awarded in consideration for (A)&nbsp;cash

 any or all of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by the Participant as of the date of termination of Continuous Service under the terms of the Restricted Stock Award Agreement.

. Rights to acquire shares of Series B Preferred Stock under the Restricted Stock Award Agreement will be transferable by the Participant only upon such terms and conditions as are set forth in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement
 as the Board will determine in its sole discretion
 so long as Series B Preferred Stock awarded under the Restricted Stock Award Agreement remains subject to the terms of the Restricted Stock Award Agreement.









Each Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement will be in such form and will contain such terms and conditions as the Board deems appropriate. The terms and conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements may change from time to time
 and the terms and conditions of separate Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements need not be identical. Each Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement will conform to (through incorporation of the provisions hereof by reference in the Agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions:

 At the time of grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award
 the Board will determine the consideration
 if any
 to be paid by the Participant upon delivery of each share of Series B Preferred Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Unit Award. The consideration to be paid (if any) by the Participant for each share of Series B Preferred Stock subject to a Restricted Stock Unit Award may be paid in any form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board
 in its sole discretion
 and permissible under applicable law.

At the time of the grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award
 the Board may impose such restrictions on or conditions to the vesting of the Restricted Stock Unit Award as it
 in its sole discretion
 deems appropriate.

. A Restricted Stock Unit Award may be settled by the delivery of shares of Series B Preferred Stock
 their cash equivalent
 any combination thereof or in any other form of consideration
 as determined by the Board and contained in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement.

At the time of the grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award
 the Board
 as it deems appropriate
 may impose such restrictions or conditions that delay the delivery of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock (or their cash equivalent) subject to a Restricted Stock Unit Award to a time after the vesting of such Restricted Stock Unit Award.

Dividend equivalents may be credited in respect of shares of Series B Preferred Stock covered by a Restricted Stock Unit Award
 as determined by the Board and contained in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement. At the sole discretion of the Board
 such dividend equivalents may be converted into additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock covered by the Restricted Stock Unit Award in such manner as determined by the Board. Any additional shares covered by the Restricted Stock Unit Award credited by reason of such dividend equivalents will be subject to all of the same terms and conditions of the underlying Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement to which they relate.

Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement
 such portion of the Restricted Stock Unit Award that has not vested will be forfeited upon the Participant&rsquo;s termination of Continuous Service.







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein
 any Restricted Stock Unit Award granted under the Plan that is not exempt from the requirements of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code shall contain such provisions so that such Restricted Stock Unit Award will comply with the requirements of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code. Such restrictions
 if any
 shall be determined by the Board and contained in the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement evidencing such Restricted Stock Unit Award. For example
 such restrictions may include
 without limitation
 a requirement that any Series B Preferred Stock that is to be issued in a year following the year in which the Restricted Stock Unit Award vests must be issued in accordance with a fixed pre-determined schedule.

. Other forms of Stock Awards valued in whole or in part by reference to
 or otherwise based on
 Series B Preferred Stock
 including the appreciation in value thereof (e.g.
 options or stock rights with an exercise price or strike price less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Series B Preferred Stock at the time of grant) may be granted either alone or in addition to Stock Awards provided for under Section 5 and the preceding provisions of this Section 6. Subject to the provisions of the Plan
 the Board will have sole and complete authority to determine the persons to whom and the time or times at which such Other Stock Awards will be granted
 the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock (or the cash equivalent thereof) to be granted pursuant to such Other Stock Awards and all other terms and conditions of such Other Stock Awards.





provided
 however

 any Stock Award or any Series B Preferred Stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Stock Award. If
 after reasonable efforts and at a reasonable cost
 the Company is unable to obtain from any such regulatory commission or agency the authority that counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of Series B Preferred Stock under the Plan
 the Company will be relieved from any liability for failure to issue and sell Series B Preferred Stock upon exercise of such Stock Awards unless and until such authority is obtained. A Participant will not be eligible for the grant of a Stock Award or the subsequent issuance of cash or Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to the Stock Award if such grant or issuance would be in violation of any applicable securities law.

The Company will have no duty or obligation to any Participant to advise such holder as to the time or manner of exercising such Stock Award. Furthermore
 the Company will have no duty or obligation to warn or otherwise advise such holder of a pending termination or expiration of a Stock Award or a possible period in which the Stock Award may not be exercised. The Company has no duty or obligation to minimize the tax consequences of a Stock Award to the holder of such Stock Award.











 Corporate action constituting a grant by the Company of a Stock Award to any Participant will be deemed completed as of the date of such corporate action
 unless otherwise determined by the Board
 regardless of when the instrument
 certificate
 or letter evidencing the Stock Award is communicated to
 or actually received or accepted by
 the Participant. In the event that the corporate records (e.g.
 Board consents
 resolutions or minutes) documenting the corporate action constituting the grant contain terms (e.g.
 exercise price
 vesting schedule or number of shares) that are inconsistent with those in the Stock Award Agreement as a result of a clerical error in the papering of the Stock Award Agreement
 the corporate records will control and the Participant will have no legally binding right to the incorrect term in the Stock Award Agreement.

 No Participant will be deemed to be the holder of
 or to have any of the rights of a holder with respect to
 any shares of Series B Preferred Stock subject to a Stock Award unless and until (i)&nbsp;such Participant has satisfied all requirements for exercise of
 or the issuance of shares of Series B Preferred Stock under
 the Stock Award pursuant to its terms
 and (ii)&nbsp;the issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock subject to the Stock Award has been entered into the books and records of the Company.

 Nothing in the Plan
 any Stock Award Agreement or any other instrument executed thereunder or in connection with any Stock Award granted pursuant thereto will confer upon any Participant any right to continue to serve the Company or an Affiliate in the capacity in effect at the time the Stock Award was granted or will affect the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate (i)&nbsp;the employment of an Employee with or without notice and with or without cause
 (ii)&nbsp;the service of a Consultant pursuant to the terms of such Consultant&rsquo;s agreement with the Company or an Affiliate
 or (iii)&nbsp;the service of a Director pursuant to the bylaws of the Company or an Affiliate
 and any applicable provisions of the corporate law of the state in which the Company or the Affiliate is incorporated
 as the case may be.

. In the event a Participant&rsquo;s regular level of time commitment in the performance of his or her services for the Company and any Affiliates is reduced (for example
 and without limitation
 if the Participant is an Employee of the Company and the Employee has a change in status from a full-time Employee to a part-time Employee) after the date of grant of any Stock Award to the Participant
 the Board has the right in its sole discretion to (x) make a corresponding reduction in the number of shares subject to any portion of such Stock Award that is scheduled to vest or become payable after the date of such change in time commitment
 and (y) in lieu of or in combination with such a reduction
 extend the vesting or payment schedule applicable to such Stock Award. In the event of any such reduction
 the Participant will have no right with respect to any portion of the Stock Award that is so reduced or extended.







 To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the time of grant) of Series B Preferred Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Optionholder during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Affiliates) exceeds $100
000 (or such other limit established in the Code) or otherwise does not comply with the rules governing Incentive Stock Options
 the Options or portions thereof that exceed such limit (according to the order in which they were granted) or otherwise do not comply with such rules will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options
 notwithstanding any contrary provision of the applicable Option Agreement(s).

 The Company may require a Participant
 as a condition of exercising or acquiring Series B Preferred Stock under any Stock Award
 (i)&nbsp;to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company as to the Participant&rsquo;s knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and/or to employ a purchaser representative reasonably satisfactory to the Company who is knowledgeable and experienced in financial and business matters and that he or she is capable of evaluating
 alone or together with the purchaser representative
 the merits and risks of exercising the Stock Award; and (ii)&nbsp;to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company stating that the Participant is acquiring Series B Preferred Stock subject to the Stock Award for the Participant&rsquo;s own account and not with any present intention of selling or otherwise distributing the Series B Preferred Stock. The foregoing requirements
 and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements
 will be inoperative if (A)&nbsp;the issuance of the shares upon the exercise or acquisition of Series B Preferred Stock under the Stock Award has been registered under a then currently effective registration statement under the Securities Act
 or (B)&nbsp;as to any particular requirement
 a determination is made by counsel for the Company that such requirement need not be met in the circumstances under the then applicable securities laws. The Company may
 upon advice of counsel to the Company
 place legends on stock certificates issued under the Plan as such counsel deems necessary or appropriate in order to comply with applicable securities laws
 including
 but not limited to
 legends restricting the transfer of the Series B Preferred Stock.

 Unless prohibited by the terms of a Stock Award Agreement
 the Company may
 in its sole discretion
 satisfy any federal

 however
 that no shares of Series B Preferred Stock are withheld with a value exceeding the minimum amount of tax required to be withheld by law (or such lesser amount as may be necessary to avoid classification of the Stock Award as a liability for financial accounting purposes); (iii)&nbsp;withholding cash from a Stock Award settled in cash; (iv) withholding payment from any amounts otherwise payable to the Participant; or (v)&nbsp;by such other method as may be set forth in the Stock Award Agreement.










 To the extent permitted by applicable law
 the Board
 in its sole discretion
 may determine that the delivery of Series B Preferred Stock or the payment of cash
 upon the exercise
 vesting or settlement of all or a portion of any Stock Award may be deferred and may establish programs and procedures for deferral elections to be made by Participants. Deferrals by Participants will be made in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. Consistent with Section 409A of the Code
 the Board may provide for distributions while a Participant is still an employee or otherwise providing services to the Company. The Board is authorized to make deferrals of Stock Awards and determine when
 and in what annual percentages
 Participants may receive payments
 including lump sum payments
 following the Participant&rsquo;s termination of Continuous Service
 and implement such other terms and conditions consistent with the provisions of the Plan and in accordance with applicable law.

To the extent that the Board determines that any Stock Award granted hereunder is subject to Section&nbsp;409A of the Code
 the Stock Award Agreement evidencing such Stock Award shall incorporate the terms and conditions necessary to avoid the consequences specified in Section&nbsp;409A(a)(1) of the Code. To the extent applicable
 the Plan and Stock Award Agreements shall be interpreted in accordance with Section&nbsp;409A of the Code.

. The terms of any repurchase right will be specified in the Stock Award Agreement. The repurchase price for vested shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be the Fair Market Value of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock on the date of repurchase. The repurchase price for unvested shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be the lower of (i)&nbsp;the Fair Market Value of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock on the date of repurchase or (ii)&nbsp;their original purchase price. However
 the Company will not exercise its repurchase right until at least six&nbsp;months (or such longer or shorter period of time necessary to avoid classification of the Stock Award as a liability for financial accounting purposes) have elapsed following delivery of shares of Series B Preferred Stock subject to the Stock Award
 unless otherwise specifically provided by the Board.



. In the event of a Capitalization Adjustment
 the Board will appropriately and proportionately adjust: (i)&nbsp;the class(es) and maximum number of securities subject to the Plan pursuant to Section&nbsp;3(a)
 (ii)&nbsp;the class(es) and maximum number of securities that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options pursuant to Section&nbsp;3(c)
 and (iii)&nbsp;the class(es) and number of securities and price per share of stock subject to outstanding Stock Awards. The Board will make such adjustments
 and its determination will be final
 binding and conclusive.

. Except as otherwise provided in the Stock Award Agreement
 in the event of a Dissolution of the Company
 all outstanding Stock Awards (other than Stock Awards consisting of vested and outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock not subject to a forfeiture condition or the Company&rsquo;s right of repurchase) will terminate immediately before the completion of such Dissolution
 and the shares of Series B Preferred Stock subject to the Company&rsquo;s repurchase rights or subject to a forfeiture condition may be repurchased or









 however

 in its sole discretion
 cause some or all Stock Awards to become fully vested
 exercisable and/or no longer subject to repurchase or forfeiture (to the extent such Stock Awards have not previously expired or terminated) before the Dissolution is completed but contingent on its completion.

 The following provisions will apply to Stock Awards in the event of a Transaction unless otherwise provided in the Stock Award Agreement or any other written agreement between the Company or any Affiliate and the Participant or unless otherwise expressly provided by the Board at the time of grant of a Stock Award. In the event of a Transaction
 then
 notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan
 the Board may take one or more of the following actions with respect to Stock Awards
 contingent upon the closing or completion of the Transaction:

&nbsp;arrange for the surviving corporation or acquiring corporation (or the surviving or acquiring corporation&rsquo;s parent company) to assume or continue the Stock Award or to substitute a similar stock award for the Stock Award (including
 but not limited to
 an award to acquire the same consideration paid to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Transaction);



&nbsp;accelerate the vesting
 in whole or in part
 of the Stock Award (and
 if applicable
 the time at which the Stock Award may be exercised) to a date before the effective time of such Transaction as the Board determines (or
 if the Board does not determine such a date
 to the date that is five&nbsp;days before the effective date of the Transaction)
 with such Stock Award terminating if not exercised (if applicable) at or before the effective time of the Transaction; provided
 however
 that the Board may require Participants to complete and deliver to the Company a notice of exercise before the effective date of a Transaction
 which exercise is contingent upon the effectiveness of such Transaction;

&nbsp;arrange for the lapse
 in whole or in part
 of any reacquisition or repurchase rights held by the Company with respect to the Stock Award;

&nbsp;cancel or arrange for the cancellation of the Stock Award
 to the extent not vested or not exercised before the effective time of the Transaction
 in exchange for such cash consideration
 if any
 as the Board
 in its sole discretion
 may consider appropriate; and

&nbsp;make a payment
 in such form as may be determined by the Board equal to the excess
 if any
 of (A)&nbsp;the value of the property the Participant would have received upon the exercise of the Stock Award immediately before the effective time of the Transaction
 over (B)&nbsp;any exercise price payable by such holder in connection with such exercise. For clarity
 this payment may be zero ($0) if the value of the property is equal to or less than the exercise price. Payments under this provision may be delayed to the same extent that payment of consideration








 earn outs
 holdbacks or any other contingencies.



 A Stock Award may be subject to additional acceleration of vesting and exercisability upon or after a Change in Control as may be provided in the Stock Award Agreement for such Stock Award or as may be provided in any other written agreement between the Company or any Affiliate and the Participant
 but in the absence of such provision
 no such acceleration will occur.



 The Board may suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. Unless terminated sooner by the Board
 the Plan will automatically terminate on the day before the 10th anniversary of the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the date the Plan is adopted by the Board
 or (ii)&nbsp;the date the Plan is approved by the stockholders of the Company. No Stock Awards may be granted under the Plan while the Plan is suspended or after it is terminated.

If any shares of Series A Preferred Stock reserved for the purpose of issuance upon the exercise of this Warrant require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such shares may be validly issued or delivered upon exercise
 then the Corporation shall in good faith and as expeditiously as possible endeavor to secure such registration or approval
 as the case may be.

 the Corporation shall also return to Holder a new Warrant of like tenor as this one
 but noting (for the avoidance of double-counting) the number of Shares for which the Warrant has already been exercised and for which the Warrant therefore cannot be exercised again as to the same Shares.

. Promptly after Holder exercises this Warrant
 the Corporation shall deliver to Holder a stock certificate for the Shares acquired.

. On receipt of an affidavit or similar instrument from Holder with respect to the loss
 theft
 destruction or mutilation of this Warrant and
 in the case of loss
 theft or destruction
 on delivery of an indemnity agreement reasonably satisfactory in form and amount to the Corporation or
 in the case of mutilation
 on surrender and cancellation of this Warrant
 the Corporation at its expense shall execute and deliver
 in lieu of this Warrant
 a new warrant of like tenor.



&nbsp;Reclassification
 Exchange or Substitution
 reverse stock split
 stock dividend
 reclassification
 exchange
 substitution
 or other event that results in a change of the class of the securities issuable upon exercise of this Warrant
 or any reorganization
 consolidation
 or merger that is not an Acquisition
 Holder shall be entitled to receive
 upon exercise of this Warrant
 the calculated number or amount of appropriately adjusted corresponding shares (or other securities or property
 as applicable). The Corporation or its successor shall promptly issue to Holder a new replacement Warrant for such new securities or other property. The new Warrant shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article 3. The provisions of this Section 3.1 shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications
 exchanges
 substitutions
 or to successive reorganizations
 consolidations
 or mergers that are not an Acquisition
 or other events.

&nbsp;Sale
 Merger
. This Warrant shall immediately terminate upon the closing of any Acquisition. For the purpose of this Warrant
 means (i) a sale
 conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the property or business of the Corporation
 or (ii) a merger or consolidation with or into any other entity
 unless the stockholders of the Corporation immediately before the transaction own 50% or more of the voting stock of the acquiring or surviving corporation following the transaction (taking into account
 in the numerator
 only stock of the Corporation held by such stockholders before the transaction and stock issued in respect of such prior held stock of the Corporation)
 or (iii) any other transaction which results in (assuming an immediate and maximum exercise/conversion of all derivative securities issued in the transaction) the holders of the Corporation&rsquo;s capital stock as of









 provided
 however
 that a bona fide equity financing transaction in which the Corporation is the surviving corporation and does not (directly or through a subsidiary) receive any assets other than cash and rights to receive cash shall be deemed not to constitute an Acquisition of the Corporation. A series of related transactions shall be deemed to constitute a single transaction
 and where such transactions involve securities issuances
 they shall be deemed &ldquo;related&rdquo; if under applicable securities laws they would be treated as integrated.

The Corporation represents and warrants to the Holder that (i) all shares of Series A Preferred Stock which may be issued upon the exercise of this Warrant will
 upon issuance
 be validly issued
 fully paid and nonassessable
 with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof
 and free from all taxes
 liens and charges created by the Corporation with respect to the issue thereof and (ii) the issuance of this Warrant
 the shares of Series A Preferred Stock issuable hereunder and the other transactions contemplated hereunder do not require the consent of any person or entity and do not and shall not conflict
 result in a default under or violate the terms of any agreement
 contract
 document
 instrument or obligation which may be binding upon the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries. The Corporation covenants and agrees that it will take all such action as may be required to assure that the Corporation shall at all times have authorized and reserved
 free from preemptive rights
 a sufficient number of shares of its Series A Preferred Stock to be issued upon the exercise of this Warrant and a sufficient number of shares of its Common Stock to be issued upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock issuable under this Warrant. If any shares of Series A Preferred Stock reserved for the purpose of issuance upon the exercise of this Warrant require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such shares may be validly issued or delivered upon exercise
 then the Corporation shall in good faith and as expeditiously as possible endeavor to secure such registration or approval
 as the case may be.



. Until actual delivery to the Corporation&rsquo;s principal office of this original Warrant accompanied by a duly endorsed instrument of transfer in a form reasonably acceptable to the Corporation
 the Corporation may treat Holder as the sole record and beneficial holder of the Warrant for all purposes whatsoever
 regardless of any notice given or received to the contrary.

The Corporation shall pay all documentary
 stamp or other transactional taxes attributable to the issuance or delivery of Shares upon exercise of all or any part of this Warrant.

. This Warrant does not entitle Holder to any voting rights or other rights as a stockholder of the Corporation before the exercise hereof. Upon proper exercise of this Warrant
 the Shares so purchased shall be and be deemed to be issued to Holder as of the close of business on the date of proper exercise.

. All notices required or permitted hereunder must be in writing and addressed as set forth in the last sentence of this Section and shall be deemed effectively given upon the earliest of (a) actual receipt
 or (b) if personally delivered to the party to whom notice is to be given
 the date of delivery
 or (c) if sent by email
 the date of transmission
 if sent to such email address before 5:00 p.m. at the location of receipt on a business day
 or the first business day after the date of transmission
 if sent to such email address at or after 5:00 p.m. at the location of receipt on a









 or (d) if sent by overnight courier and addressed as set forth above
 the next business day after the date of deposit with such courier (by the courier&rsquo;s stated time for enabling next-business-day delivery)
 or if deposited after such stated time shall be deemed to be the second business day after the date of deposit
 or (e) if sent in the United States by United States certified mail
 return receipt requested
 postage prepaid and addressed as set forth above
 on the fifth business day after such mailing. All communications shall be sent to the Corporation at its principal place of business or to Holder at Holder&rsquo;s address or email address as shown in the Corporation&rsquo;s records
 or to such other address as such party may designate by 10 days&rsquo; advance written notice to the other.

. Any term of this Warrant may be amended or waived only with the written consent of the Corporation and a majority of the persons who are then serving as Series A Preferred Directors of the Corporation. Any amendment or waiver effected in accordance with this Section shall be binding upon the Corporation
 the holder of this Warrant and each and every transferee of the Warrant or Shares.

. This Warrant shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California
 without giving effect to its principles regarding conflicts of law.

. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS WARRANT
 THE SHARES OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS TRANSACTION
 INCLUDING

 of every nature
 kind and description
 absolute or contingent
 liquidated or unliquidated
 in law
 equity or otherwise
 which have arisen

 Lincoln Park does not release (i) any rights to enforce this Agreement; (ii) any claims it is precluded from waiving by operation of law; (iii) any rights it is entitled to as a holder of KonaRed&rsquo;s common stock; (iv) all rights
 claims and liabilities it is entitled under the New Note; (v) its rights to indemnification and payment of defense costs
 under applicable law or any indemnification provision contained in any of the Contracts; or (vi) any claims (but not

 except as set forth in (ii) above
 under any of the Contracts) that may arise after the Effective Date.

. Lincoln Park expressly waives any and all rights and benefits conferred upon it by Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California
 which states as follows:

&ldquo;A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release
 which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.&rdquo;


 and to that extent it waives any such substantially similar common law principle or other federal or state statute.

. Each Party expressly agrees and understands that the release given by it pursuant to this Agreement applies to all unknown
 unsuspected
 and unanticipated rights
 claims
 liabilities
 and causes of action which it may have against any of the applicable set of Releasees
 and this release shall be fully effective even in the event that either Party hereafter discovers facts in addition to
 or different from
 those which it now knows or believes to be true.

. Each Party represents and warrants to the other Party that it has not sold
 assigned
 conveyed
 pledged
 encumbered
 or otherwise in any way transferred to any person or entity any interest in the rights
 claims
 liabilities or causes of action it is releasing in this Agreement.

. Lincoln Park represents and warrants that as of immediately before this Agreement
 its holdings of outstanding KonaRed common stock consisted of exactly 1
349
456 shares of KonaRed common stock (including 1
136
364 shares owned of record and 213
092 shares owned beneficially but held in street name). Based on such representation and warranty
 KonaRed confirms that Lincoln Park&rsquo;s ownership of such 1
349
456 shares is expressly excluded from this Agreement and need not be surrendered or forgone in connection with this Agreement.

. This Agreement contains the entire understanding and agreement between the Parties hereto with respect to the matters referred to herein and supersedes any and all prior and contemporaneous commitments
 undertakings and agreements
 whether written or oral
 with regard to the subject matter of this Agreement. The Parties further acknowledge and agree that parol evidence shall not be required to interpret the intent of the Parties. No other representations
 warranties
 covenants
 undertakings
 commitments
 promises or other prior or contemporary agreements
 whether oral or written
 respecting such matters
 which are not specifically incorporated herein
 shall be deemed in any way to exist or bind any of the Parties. The Parties acknowledge that each Party has not relied
 in deciding whether to enter into this Agreement on this Agreement&rsquo;s expressly stated terms and conditions
 on any representations
 warranties
 covenants
 undertakings
 commitments
 promises or agreements
 which are not expressly set forth within this Agreement.

. Each Party hereto agrees to execute and perform such other documents and acts as are reasonably required in order to facilitate the terms of this Agreement
 and the intent thereof
 and to cooperate in good faith in order to effectuate the provisions of this Agreement.








. The Parties acknowledge that this Agreement is reasonable
 valid
 and enforceable.

Waiver
 Amendment
 and Modification of Agreement
 amendment
 or modification of any of the terms and/or conditions of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the persons affected by the waiver
 amendment
 or modification. No waiver of any term
 condition or default of any term of this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any other term
 condition or default.

. This Agreement may be signed in counterparts and said counterparts shall be treated as though signed as one document. Delivery of signed counterparts electronically (e.g.
 by .pdf attachment to email) shall be deemed valid delivery for all purposes.

. Each Party shall be responsible for all of its own legal fees and costs
 including but not limited to those incurred in connection with the negotiation
 preparation and entering into of this Agreement. In the event of any legal
 arbitration or administrative proceedings after the date of this Agreement with respect to any claim covered by the release provisions of this Agreement
 or with respect to enforcement or interpretation of this Agreement
 if a Party hereto is the prevailing Party
 it shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs.

. This Agreement and its terms shall be governed by and construed under California law
 without regard to conflict-of-law principles.

 Each of Lincoln Park and KonaRed hereby acknowledge
 represent
 and warrant that it has
 in connection with this Agreement and all matters
 claims and disputes within the scope of this Agreement
 been represented by
 consulted with and advised by qualified and competent legal counsel
 before the execution of this Agreement. Each Party confirms that it has read this Agreement carefully
 and understands the import and substance of each and all of the terms set forth in this Agreement. Each Party understands and agrees that if any of the facts or matters upon which it now relies in making this Agreement hereafter prove to be otherwise
 this Agreement will nonetheless remain in full force and effect. Each Party is entering this Agreement voluntarily
 without any coercion
 and based upon such Party&rsquo;s own judgment.

. Given that the Parties have had the opportunity to draft
 review
 and edit the language of this Agreement with the assistance and advice of counsel
 no presumption for or against either Party arising out of drafting all or any part of this Agreement shall be applied in any action or proceeding involving this Agreement. Accordingly
 the Parties hereby waive the benefit of any federal
 state or local law or principle
 providing that in cases of uncertainty
 language of a contract should be interpreted against the Party who caused the uncertainty to exist. This Agreement is the product of a negotiated
 bargained-for exchange of mutual valuable consideration.

. Lincoln Park agrees that it shall not initiate
 institute
 commence
 participate in
 continue
 file
 or otherwise prosecute
 whether directly or indirectly
 or through a third Party
 any action
 lawsuit
 cause of action
 arbitration
 administrative proceedings
 claim
 demand
 or legal proceedings for or arising out of or relating to any right
 claim
 etc. released hereby.

. Lincoln Park agrees that it shall never recommend

 solicit
 assist (including without limitation by disclosing or allowing the disclosure of investigative materials or information contained therein)
 participate in or cooperate with
 whether directly or indirectly
 or through a third party
 any person in connection with any action
 lawsuit
 cause of action
 arbitration
 administrative proceedings
 claim
 demand
 or legal proceedings against KonaRed with regard









 claim
 etc. released hereby.

. This Agreement is severable. If any portion(s) of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable
 the portion(s) shall be construed in such a manner as will to the maximum extent possible enable such portion(s) to be enforceable
 the remaining portions of this Agreement shall be enforced to the maximum extent possible
 and the unenforceable portion shall not affect the enforceability of the remaining provisions.

The Parties each acknowledge and agree (a) that the terms specified in this Agreement are a full and complete compromise of matters involving disputed issues of law and fact; (b) that neither any Party&rsquo;s agreement to these terms nor any Party&rsquo;s statement made during the negotiations for this Agreement shall be considered
 nor shall they be
 admissions by any Party hereto; and (c) that no past or present wrongdoing shall be implied or claimed on the part of the Parties to this Agreement.

. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to
 or shall be deemed or construed to
 be an admission by any Party hereto
 for any wrongdoing or liability whatsoever. For avoidance of doubt: this Agreement shall not be construed as an admission by KonaRed of any improper
 wrongful or unlawful actions
 or any wrongdoing against Lincoln Park
 and KonaRed specifically denies and disclaims any liability to or wrongful acts against Lincoln Park on the part of KonaRed or any KonaRed Releasees.

 and deferred income tax asset valuations. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts
 historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company&amp;#x2019;s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between estimates and the actual results
 future results of operations will be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;

 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;Revenue from customer purchase agreements is recorded as unearned revenue and amortized over the term of the agreements. At December 31
 2017 and December 31
 2016
 unearned revenues were $152
986 and $193
020 respectively. Unearned revenue is normally comprised of online subscriptions wherein we ship a scheduled amount of product to online retail subscribers each month. During the year ended December 31
 2016
 unearned revenue also included a cash payment we received for a non-refundable signing fee of $200
000 from a strategic supplier partnership arrangement (the &amp;#x201c;FP Agreement&amp;#x201d;). The FP Agreement was executed on October 28
 2016 and because this was included in a license fee agreement
 to conform with generally accepted accounting principles it is recorded as unearned revenue which is to be amortized over the five year life of the agreement. For fiscal 2017 and 2016
 the amortized portion was $40
000 and $7
014
 respectively. The fee is recorded as other income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;

 Times
 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;Inventories are composed of raw materials and finished goods. Our raw materials inventory is comprised of dried coffee fruit and other input components
 such as labels
 caps
 and packaging materials. Our finished goods inventory process begins when we take possession of dried coffee fruit from coffee growers in Hawaii. We then ship the raw material to our California warehouse for storage and then send required quantities to subcontractors for value-added processing; or we ship the raw materials directly from Hawaii to the processors. For our beverage products which include coffee fruit
 value-added processing then occurs whereby the dried coffee fruit is converted to liquid extract through water based extraction. The extracts are then shipped from the raw materials processors to our California warehouse or directly to our bottling contractors. The bottling contractors then add our proprietary extract to other ingredients to produce our finished goods. Our cold brew coffee is manufactured using a comparable process. Finished goods are shipped back to either our Company&amp;#x2019;s warehouse or third party transit agents and subsequently disseminated to either distributors or shipped directly to retailers. The process for production of our nutritional wellness products follows a similar manufacturing chain
 but does not involve a bottling process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;
 Times
 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
 as determined on an average basis
 or market.&amp;#xa0;Market value is determined by reference to selling prices at
 or around
 balance sheet date or by management&amp;#x2019;s estimates based on prevailing market conditions. Management writes down the inventories to market value if it is below cost. Management also regularly evaluates the composition of its inventories to identify slow-moving and obsolete inventories to determine if a valuation allowance is required. If a valuation allowance is required
 an offsetting entry is made which expenses the reserved inventory to cost of goods sold during the period in which the valuation was required. Subsequently
 if this reserved inventory is used in future periods
 an offset is entered to cost of goods sold which decreases cost of goods sold during that subsequent period. Costs of raw material and finished goods inventories include purchase and related costs incurred in bringing the products to their present location and condition. Labor
 direct and indirect overhead
 and the processing
 bottling and shipping costs incurred during 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; party manufacturing are factored into the costs of our inventories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;

 the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method
 deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that
 based on available evidence
 are not expected to be realized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;
 Times
 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;The Company also follows the guidance related to accounting for income tax uncertainties. In accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
 the Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold
 the amount recognized in these financial statements is the benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;

 the Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities
 the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date

 the Company had outstanding a senior convertible note (the &amp;#x201c;VDF Note&amp;#x201d;) with a balance of $869
674
 net of a discount of $16
786. The Company determined the VDF Note had an embedded derivative valued at $11
649 at December 31
 2016 due to Sr. Note One having a provision which required adjustments to the conversion price to compensate for dilutive stock issuance events unrelated to the VDF Note. During the period ended December 31
 2016
 $417
188 of principal was added to the VDF Note. This was comprised of $375
000 of patent license fees which were rolled over to the VDF Note and accrued interest for the year ended December 31
 2016 of $42
188. On September 29
 2017
 the Company and VDF signed an amendment to the Senior Convertible Note. Per the amendment
 the companies agreed that the total new outstanding balance was $916
457
 and that VDF immediately converted all of the debt into equity of common shares at a conversion price of $0.07 per share
 resulting in 13
092

 &lt;i&gt;Earnings per Share. &lt;/i&gt;ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (&amp;#x201c;EPS&amp;#x201d;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including stock warrants and options
 using the treasury stock method; and convertible preferred stock and convertible debt using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS
 the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.&amp;#xa0;The Company currently has options
 warrants and convertible debt outstanding
 and no convertible preferred stock has been issued. Common stock equivalents pertaining to the options
 warrants and convertible debt were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per common share in these financial statements because the effect would have been anti-dilutive due to the net losses&amp;#xa0;for the years ended December 31

 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;As defined in ASC 820 &amp;#x201c;Fair Value Measurements&amp;#x201d;
 fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
 including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.&amp;#xa0;These inputs can be readily observable
 market corroborated
 or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;
 Times
 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;The three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined by ASC 820 are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;
 Times
 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;Level 1 &amp;#x2013; Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives
 marketable securities and listed equities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;
 Times
 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;Level 2 &amp;#x2013; Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry standard models that consider various assumptions
 including quoted forward prices for commodities
 time value
 volatility factors
 and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments
 as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument
 can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity swaps
 interest rate swaps
 options and collars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;
 Times
 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;Level 3 &amp;#x2013; Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management&amp;#x2019;s best estimate of fair value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;
 Times
 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;The Company&amp;#x2019;s Level 1 assets and liabilities consist of cash
 accounts receivable
 accounts receivable - related party
 inventories net
 of any inventory allowance
 prepaid expenses
 other current assets
 accounts payable and accrued liabilities
 accounts payable - related party
 short term debt
 net of discounts
 and unearned revenue. Pursuant to ASC 820
 the fair value of these assets and liabilities is determined based on Level 1 inputs
 which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 assets and liabilities consist of a derivative liability arising from a convertible note payable. Pursuant to ASC 820
 the fair value of this liability is determined based on Level 2 inputs
 which consisted of a valuation by an accredited third party expert.

 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;In April 2016
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&amp;#x201c;FASB&amp;#x201d;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&amp;#x201c;ASU&amp;#x201d;) No. 2016-15 &amp;#x201c;Statement of Cash Flows&amp;#x201d; (Topic 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments because stakeholders had indicated that there is diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230
 Statement of Cash Flows
 and other Topics. This Update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The amendments in this Update apply to all entities
 including both business entities and not-for-profit entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows under Topic 230. Among the eight issues
 there were two which appeared germane to the Company: (i) &lt;font style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Debt Prepayment or Debt Extinguishment Costs&lt;/font&gt;
 which provided guidance that Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities; and (ii) &lt;font style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance Principle&lt;/font&gt;
 which provided guidance that the classification of cash receipts and payments that have aspects of more than one class of cash flows should be determined first by applying specific guidance in generally accepted accounting principles. In the absence of specific guidance
 an entity should determine each separately identifiable source or use within the cash receipts and cash payments on the basis of the nature of the underlying cash flows. An entity should then classify each separately identifiable source or use within the cash receipts and payments on the basis of their nature in financing
 investing
 or operating activities. In situations in which cash receipts and payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows and cannot be separated by source or use
 the appropriate classification should depend on the activity that is likely to be the predominant source or use of cash flows for the item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;
 Times
 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities
 the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019. Early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period
 any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. This ASU conforms with the Company&amp;#x2019;s current protocols and the Company expects to adopt this ASU once it becomes effective. The Company does not expect the adoption of the ASU to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;
 Times
 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;In April 2016
 FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10 &amp;#x201c;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&amp;#x201d; (Topic 606). This follows the May 28
 2014
 FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issuance of a converged standard on recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The amendments in this Update affect entities with transactions included within the scope of Topic 606. The scope of that Topic includes entities that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services (that are an output of the entity&amp;#x2019;s ordinary activities) in exchange for consideration. The core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in this Update affect the guidance in Accounting Standards Update 2014-09
 &lt;i&gt;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
 &lt;/i&gt;which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this Update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606 (and any other Topic amended by Update 2014-09). Accounting Standards Update 2015-14
 &lt;i&gt;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date&lt;/i&gt;
 defers the effective date of Update 2014-09 by one year. The Company will evaluate this standard and may implement adoption of once the standard becomes effective. The Company does not expect the adoption of the standard to have a significant impact on our financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;

 unearned revenues were $152

 unearned revenue also included a cash payment we received for a non-refundable signing fee of $200
000 from a strategic supplier partnership arrangement (the &amp;#x201c;FP Agreement&amp;#x201d;). The FP Agreement was executed on October 28
 2016 and because this was included in a license fee agreement

 the amortized portion was $40
000 and $7

 respectively. The fee is recorded as other income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;

 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;Inventories are composed of raw materials and finished goods. Our raw materials inventory is comprised of dried coffee fruit and other input components
 such as labels
 caps
 and packaging materials. Our finished goods inventory process begins when we take possession of dried coffee fruit from coffee growers in Hawaii. We then ship the raw material to our California warehouse for storage and then send required quantities to subcontractors for value-added processing; or we ship the raw materials directly from Hawaii to the processors. For our beverage products which include coffee fruit
 value-added processing then occurs whereby the dried coffee fruit is converted to liquid extract through water based extraction. The extracts are then shipped from the raw materials processors to our California warehouse or directly to our bottling contractors. The bottling contractors then add our proprietary extract to other ingredients to produce our finished goods. Our cold brew coffee is manufactured using a comparable process. Finished goods are shipped back to either our Company&amp;#x2019;s warehouse or third party transit agents and subsequently disseminated to either distributors or shipped directly to retailers. The process for production of our nutritional wellness products follows a similar manufacturing chain
 but does not involve a bottling process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;
 Times
 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
 as determined on an average basis
 or market.&amp;#xa0;Market value is determined by reference to selling prices at
 or around
 balance sheet date or by management&amp;#x2019;s estimates based on prevailing market conditions. Management writes down the inventories to market value if it is below cost. Management also regularly evaluates the composition of its inventories to identify slow-moving and obsolete inventories to determine if a valuation allowance is required. If a valuation allowance is required
 an offsetting entry is made which expenses the reserved inventory to cost of goods sold during the period in which the valuation was required. Subsequently
 if this reserved inventory is used in future periods
 an offset is entered to cost of goods sold which decreases cost of goods sold during that subsequent period. Costs of raw material and finished goods inventories include purchase and related costs incurred in bringing the products to their present location and condition. Labor

 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;In accordance with ASC 740 - Income Taxes
 the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method
 deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that
 based on available evidence
 are not expected to be realized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;

 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;The Company also follows the guidance related to accounting for income tax uncertainties. In accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
 the Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold
 the amount recognized in these financial statements is the benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;

 the Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities
 the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date

 the Company had outstanding a senior convertible note (the &amp;#x201c;VDF Note&amp;#x201d;) with a balance of $869
674
 net of a discount of $16
786. The Company determined the VDF Note had an embedded derivative valued at $11
649 at December 31
 2016 due to Sr. Note One having a provision which required adjustments to the conversion price to compensate for dilutive stock issuance events unrelated to the VDF Note. During the period ended December 31
 2016
 $417
188 of principal was added to the VDF Note. This was comprised of $375

 2016 of $42
188. On September 29
 2017
 the Company and VDF signed an amendment to the Senior Convertible Note. Per the amendment
 the companies agreed that the total new outstanding balance was $916
457
 and that VDF immediately converted all of the debt into equity of common shares at a conversion price of $0.07 per share
 resulting in 13

 the classification of such costs as development costs stops and such costs are recorded as costs of production

 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;The Company computes loss per share in accordance with ASC 260
 &lt;i&gt;Earnings per Share. &lt;/i&gt;ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (&amp;#x201c;EPS&amp;#x201d;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including stock warrants and options
 using the treasury stock method; and convertible preferred stock and convertible debt using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS
 the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.&amp;#xa0;The Company currently has options
 warrants and convertible debt outstanding
 and no convertible preferred stock has been issued. Common stock equivalents pertaining to the options
 warrants and convertible debt were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per common share in these financial statements because the effect would have been anti-dilutive due to the net losses&amp;#xa0;for the years ended December 31
 2017 and December 31

 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and trade receivables. The Company places its cash with high credit quality financial institutions. At times such cash may be in excess of the FDIC limit. With respect to trade receivables
 the Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and

 Times
 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;As defined in ASC 820 &amp;#x201c;Fair Value Measurements&amp;#x201d;
 fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
 including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.&amp;#xa0;These inputs can be readily observable
 market corroborated
 or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;
 Times
 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;The three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined by ASC 820 are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;
 Times
 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;Level 1 &amp;#x2013; Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives
 marketable securities and listed equities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;
 Times
 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;Level 2 &amp;#x2013; Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry standard models that consider various assumptions
 including quoted forward prices for commodities
 time value
 volatility factors
 and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments
 as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument
 can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity swaps
 interest rate swaps
 options and collars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;
 Times
 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;Level 3 &amp;#x2013; Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management&amp;#x2019;s best estimate of fair value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;
 Times
 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;The Company&amp;#x2019;s Level 1 assets and liabilities consist of cash
 accounts receivable
 accounts receivable - related party
 inventories net
 of any inventory allowance
 prepaid expenses
 other current assets
 accounts payable and accrued liabilities
 accounts payable - related party
 short term debt
 net of discounts
 and unearned revenue. Pursuant to ASC 820
 the fair value of these assets and liabilities is determined based on Level 1 inputs
 which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 assets and liabilities consist of a derivative liability arising from a convertible note payable. Pursuant to ASC 820
 the fair value of this liability is determined based on Level 2 inputs
 which consisted of a valuation by an accredited third party expert. We do not currently have any assets or liabilities which are classified under the criterion of Level 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;finTable&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%; font-size: 10pt; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;

 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;In April 2016
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&amp;#x201c;FASB&amp;#x201d;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&amp;#x201c;ASU&amp;#x201d;) No. 2016-15 &amp;#x201c;Statement of Cash Flows&amp;#x201d; (Topic 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments because stakeholders had indicated that there is diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230
 Statement of Cash Flows
 and other Topics. This Update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The amendments in this Update apply to all entities
 including both business entities and not-for-profit entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows under Topic 230. Among the eight issues
 there were two which appeared germane to the Company: (i) &lt;font style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Debt Prepayment or Debt Extinguishment Costs&lt;/font&gt;
 which provided guidance that Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities; and (ii) &lt;font style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance Principle&lt;/font&gt;
 which provided guidance that the classification of cash receipts and payments that have aspects of more than one class of cash flows should be determined first by applying specific guidance in generally accepted accounting principles. In the absence of specific guidance
 an entity should determine each separately identifiable source or use within the cash receipts and cash payments on the basis of the nature of the underlying cash flows. An entity should then classify each separately identifiable source or use within the cash receipts and payments on the basis of their nature in financing
 investing
 or operating activities. In situations in which cash receipts and payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows and cannot be separated by source or use
 the appropriate classification should depend on the activity that is likely to be the predominant source or use of cash flows for the item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;
 Times
 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities
 the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019. Early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period
 any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. This ASU conforms with the Company&amp;#x2019;s current protocols and the Company expects to adopt this ASU once it becomes effective. The Company does not expect the adoption of the ASU to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;
 Times
 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;In April 2016
 FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10 &amp;#x201c;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&amp;#x201d; (Topic 606). This follows the May 28
 2014
 FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issuance of a converged standard on recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The amendments in this Update affect entities with transactions included within the scope of Topic 606. The scope of that Topic includes entities that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services (that are an output of the entity&amp;#x2019;s ordinary activities) in exchange for consideration. The core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in this Update affect the guidance in Accounting Standards Update 2014-09
 &lt;i&gt;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
 &lt;/i&gt;which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this Update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606 (and any other Topic amended by Update 2014-09). Accounting Standards Update 2015-14
 &lt;i&gt;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date&lt;/i&gt;
 defers the effective date of Update 2014-09 by one year. The Company will evaluate this standard and may implement adoption of once the standard becomes effective. The Company does not expect the adoption of the standard to have a significant impact on our financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;

 Times
 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis
 which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Since inception
 the Company has incurred losses totaling $37
308
866 as of December 31
 2017 and has incurred a net loss for the current year of $13
926
649. These factors
 among others
 raise substantial doubt about the Company&amp;#x2019;s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. As needed
 the Company will pursue additional equity and/or debt financing while managing cash flows from operations in an effort to provide funds to meet its obligations on a timely basis and to support future business development. The financial statements do not contain any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. To address these issues
 during the year ended December 31
 2017
 the Company raised $1
248
968 from private placement equity offerings
 $491
600 from exercise of warrants
 and benefited from conversion of $1
552
816 of debt into common shares of equity and $306
949 of debt into Series B Preferred Stock. In addition

 collectively
 the &amp;#x201c;September 2015 Notes&amp;#x201d;) to two lenders (the &amp;#x201c;September 2015 Lenders&amp;#x201d;). The September 2015 Notes provided for customary events of default such as failing to timely make payments and the occurrence of certain fundamental defaults
 as described in the September 2015 Notes. The September 2015 Notes were not secured and are subordinated to senior notes issued by the Company. September 2015 Note One had a face value of $100
000 and September 2015 Note Two had a face value of $150

 LLC (&amp;#x201c;LPC&amp;#x201d;) in the amount of $250
000. LPC Note One was issued pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement and bears interest at the rate of 5% per annum (or 18% upon the occurrence of an event of default). Principal and interest is due and payable in full on December 31
 2016 and LPC Note One is now classified as short term convertible debt. Interest may be paid via issuance of the Company&amp;#x2019;s common stock if the Company meets certain conditions that would allow the issuance of the Company&amp;#x2019;s common stock without any trading restrictions. LPC Note One has a $25
000 original issuance discount (&amp;#x201c;OID&amp;#x201d;) which resulted in net proceeds of $225
000. The Company has the right to prepay LPC Note One
 pursuant to the terms thereof
 at any time
 provided it pays a prepayment amount of 120% of the then outstanding balance
 accrued interest and interest payable from the date of prepayment to the Maturity Date. LPC Note One provides for customary events of default such as failing to timely make payments and the occurrence of certain fundamental defaults
 as described in LPC Note One. LPC Note One is not secured and is subordinated to the VDF Note
 ranks equally with LPC Note Two
 and ranks above other debt issued by the Company. The principal amount of LPC Note One and all accrued interest were convertible at the option of LPC into shares of our common stock at any time at a fixed Conversion Price of $0.07 per share
 subject to adjustments for stock splits
 stock dividends
 stock combinations or other similar transactions as provided in LPC Note One. At no time may LPC Note One be converted into shares of our common stock if such conversion would result in LPC and its affiliates owning an aggregate of shares of our common stock in excess of 4.99% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock
 provided such percentage may increase to 9.99% upon not less than 61 days prior written notice.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;As an inducement for the loan

 2015
 LPC Note One also included a BCF of $107
143 because the exercise price of LPC Note One was set below the market price of our stock when the note was executed. Since the combined warrant discount and BCF exceeded the face value of the note less OID
 the warrant discount for LPC Note One was capped at $117

 we issued a Senior Convertible Note (&amp;#x201c;LPC Note Two&amp;#x201d;) to LPC in the amount of $300
000. LPC Note Two was issued pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement and bears interest at the rate of 5% per annum (or 18% upon the occurrence of an event of default). Principal and interest is due and payable in full on December 31
 2016. LPC Note Two is now classified as short term convertible term debt. Interest may be paid via issuance of the Company&amp;#x2019;s common stock if the Company meets certain conditions that would allow the issuance of the Company&amp;#x2019;s common stock without any trading restrictions. LPC Note Two has a $30
000 OID which resulted in net proceeds of $270
000. The Company has the right to prepay LPC Note Two
 pursuant to the terms thereof
 at any time
 provided it pays a prepayment amount of 120% of the then outstanding balance
 accrued interest and interest payable from the date of prepayment to the Maturity Date. LPC Note Two provides for customary events of default such as failing to timely make payments and the occurrence of certain fundamental defaults
 as described in LPC Note Two. LPC Note Two is not secured and is subordinated to the VDF Note
 ranks equally with LPC Note One
 and ranks above other debt issued by the Company. The principal amount of LPC Note Two and all accrued interest is convertible at the option of LPC into shares of our common stock at any time at a fixed Conversion Price of $0.05 per share
 subject to adjustments for stock splits
 stock dividends
 stock combinations or other similar transactions as provided in LPC Note Two. At no time may LPC Note Two be converted into shares of our common stock if such conversion would result in LPC and its affiliates owning an aggregate of shares of our common stock in excess of 4.99% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock
 provided such percentage may increase to 9.99% upon not less than 61 days prior written notice. On November 23

 2015
 LPC Note Two also included a BCF of $102

 subject to an adjustment to 12% for events of default and we have the right
 subject to certain limitations
 to prepay principal at any time and from time to time. At any time VDF has the option to convert any principal outstanding on the VDF Note into shares of our common stock at a Conversion Price determined by the terms of the VDF Note

 options or warrants may be classified as derivative liabilities
 rather than as equity. Additionally
 the debt or equity instruments may contain embedded derivative instruments
 such as embedded derivative features which in certain circumstances may be required to be bifurcated from the associated host instrument and accounted for separately as a derivative instrument liability.

 warrants and bifurcated embedded derivative features that are accounted for as derivative instrument liabilities
 the Company estimates fair value using either quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics or other valuation techniques. The valuation techniques require assumptions related to the remaining term of the instruments and risk-free rates of return
 our current common stock price and expected dividend yield
 and the expected volatility of our common stock price over the life of the option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;

 serif; font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt;&quot;&gt;Due to the indeterminate nature of the number of common shares issuable upon exercise and/or conversion of these warrants into common shares of the Company
 the Warrants need to be accounted for as derivative instruments. These warrants taint the equity environment. Existing warrants were evaluated to determine if they are scoped out of derivative treatment. Since the Company had a number of existing warrants and options previously outstanding
 based on the warrants issued in the October 24
 2017 financing
 these warrants and options must be valued as derivative instruments because the equity environment is tainted

 2016
 the Company extended the lease for an additional 24 month term and committed to total lease payments of $10
466 for June 1

 in the absence of a new sub-lease
 be $10

 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;The VDF Note
 as previously amended
 was a senior convertible note with a maturity date of December 31
 2018. Payment requirements are accelerated pursuant to an event of default
 or if the License Agreement is terminated. Interest on the Senior Convertible Note is 7% per annum
 subject to adjustment to 12% for events of default. By maturity
 we must pay VDF all principal plus accrued interest and we have the right
 subject to certain limitations
 to prepay principal at any time and from time to time. No indebtedness shall rank senior to the payments due under the VDF Note unless prior written consent of VDF is obtained and payments under the note are secured by the Security Agreement as described below. At any time and at the option of VDF
 principal outstanding on the VDF Note may be converted into restricted common shares of the Company. The conversion price of the VDF Note was $0.2157 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:&apos;Times New Roman&apos;

 (i) the principal amount was determined to be $916

 Times
 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;The conversions resulted in a difference between the cash redemption balance and the value of the shares redemption which was treated as a conversion loss and recorded as an additional non-cash interest expense.

 serif;font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;Our revenue is derived from sales of our beverage products
 nutritional products and ingredient raw materials. Our beverage sales made up approximately 88% and 84% respectively of total sales during the years ended December 31
 2017 and December 31
 2016. For the year ended December 31
 2017
 the concentration of our beverage sales comprised sales to three major retail chain store customers totaling 41%. For the year ended December 31
 2016 the concentration of our beverage sales comprised sales to three major retail customers totaling 43%. Although the market for our products is elastic and current purchasers of our products are replaceable
 our concentration of sales creates risk to future revenues. As of December 31
 2017 and December 31
 2016 our purchases from suppliers comprised a concentration of 55% from three suppliers and 79% from three suppliers
 respectively. Although we have a selection of suppliers available to produce our products
 our concentration of purchases creates risk to future revenues. As of December 31
 2017 and December 31
 2016
 our accounts receivable had a concentration of 51% among four customers and 67% among five customers
 respectively. The concentration of our accounts receivable creates a potential risk to future working capital in the event that we were not able to collect all
 or a majority
