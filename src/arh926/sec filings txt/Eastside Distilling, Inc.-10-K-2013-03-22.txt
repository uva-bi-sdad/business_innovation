includes the internet

targeted advertising and marketing campaigns with
 what our management believes to be
 greater efficiency and more quantifiable
results than traditional marketing strategies. Traditional marketing refers to marketing campaigns carried out in the form of outdoor
(i.e. billboards and posters)
 TV commercials
 radio commercials
 trade show presence
 and direct mail advertising. Digital campaigns
eliminate the costs related to campaign setup
 execution
 and measurement regardless of how many channels are included in a campaign.
Our management believes that marketing campaigns utilizing digital interactive media provide greater value to our clients through
reduced print advertising costs (i.e. brochures and flyers) and media space buys (i.e. print ads) than traditional methods. Our
management is also of the view that digital campaigns provide results that are more determinate in that the amount of clicks
 opens
page views
 coupon redemption can be observed instantaneously
 yielding a more immediate measure of ROI than traditional media.





In April 2012
 the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (&quot;JOBS
Act&quot;) was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides
 among other things:


Exemptions for &ldquo;emerging growth companies&rdquo; from certain
financial disclosure and governance requirements


Amendments to certain provisions of the federal securities laws to
simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record holders required to trigger the reporting requirements
of the Exchange Act
 as amended;


Relaxation of the general solicitation and general advertising prohibition
for Rule 506 offerings;



    
    



Adoption of a new exemption for public offerings of securities in
amounts not exceeding $50 million; and


Exemption from registration by a non-reporting company of offers and
sales of securities of up to $1
000
000 that comply with rules to be adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities
Act and exemption of such sales from state law registration
 documentation or offering requirements.




 under the JOBS Act a company is an &ldquo;emerging
growth company&rdquo; if its initial public offering (&quot;IPO&quot;) of common equity securities was effected after December
8
 2011 and such company had less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal year. A company
will no longer qualify as an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; after the earliest of:



    
    




    
    




    
    




    

 as amended.





for non-reporting companies and for non-public offerings. Those exemptions that impact Eurocan are discussed below.

. The financial disclosure in a registration
statement filed by an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; pursuant to the Securities Act
 will differ from registration statements
filed by other companies as follows:

after the date of the JOBS Act's enactment
 except as otherwise required by SEC rule.


from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of our accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about
the audit.

. The JOBS Act also provides
an exemption from the requirement of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to file a report on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting
 although management of the Company is still required to file its report on the adequacy
of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

registered under the Exchange Act
 to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes.



    
    


 The JOBS Act also provides
that an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; can communicate with potential investors that are qualified institutional buyers
or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior to or after the date of filing
the respective registration statement. The JOBS Act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer about an &ldquo;emerging
growth company&rdquo; regardless of whether such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision. In addition
the JOBS Act precludes the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers
 dealers and
potential investors

IPOs.


to submit registration statements under the Securities Act
 as amended
 on a confidential basis provided that the registration
statement and all amendments thereto are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show. This is intended
to allow &ldquo;emerging growth companies&rdquo; to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is
seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to conduct
a roadshow.

. Section 102(b)(1)
of the JOBS Act exempts &ldquo;emerging growth companies&rdquo; from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting
standards until private companies (that is
 those that have not had a Securities Act

 registration statement declared
effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act

designed to increase sales and reinforce market presence for our clients. Our management believes that targeted digital interactive
media can deliver more measurable results for our clients than traditional media
 at a lower cost to us due to more focused targeted
offerings to consumers and
 often
 due to less competition from traditional advertisers. The use of highly targeted media also
enables us to use market research to more efficiently capitalize on consumer preferences.


 on a case-by-case
basis
 to be the most effective combination of platforms (e.g. email
 websites
 social media
 audio and video) for our clients.
We use a &ldquo;360 degree&rdquo; approach to our campaigns by zeroing in on a target group likely to be receptive to a specific
message and surrounding it from every angle
 using a variety of media to touch customers at different points along the decision-to-buy
pathway.



    
    



 we begin any campaign with defining the client and
brand message. Next
 we determine how to best adopt cross-platform methods to maximize impact and impressions. We then implement
our advertising campaigns through a combination of digital and traditional advertising platforms such as
 online banner ads
 pay-per-click
advertising
 video
 and advertising through online social marketing (Facebook
 Twitter
 etc). Finally
 we conduct a post-campaign
analysis of the campaign&rsquo;s effectiveness. We track the impressions of all digital media as well as identify the results from
traditional advertising
 and generate a marketing effectiveness report detailing the projected return on investment and next steps
for the client. This enables us to make further adjustments as required.


blasts to targeted databases
 advertising on specialized web sites and key internet web pages combined with social media and the
development of innovative audio and video products. A comprehensive mix of digital media advertising for one of our campaigns would
typically include:







mobile distribution
 such as mobile messaging
 text messages and short
messaging service;

online publication outreach
 such as articles placed on targeted industry
websites





social network and media content creation and management
 such as
Facebook and Twitter;

viral marketing campaigns
 such as YouTube;






and rollout of digital interactive media campaigns
 our comprehensive approach includes the incorporation of traditional advertising
methods into the digital mix
 where appropriate
 to fully engage the target markets. This may include print materials (e.g. print
ads
 brochures
 direct mail)
 printed media advertising placement (also known as &ldquo;media buys&rdquo;) and television and
radio broadcast ads. Our traditional advertising and marketing methods typically include:





direct response advertising and marketing
 such as direct mail
 DirecTV;

traditional media buying activities for promotion
 such as television
radio and newspapers;

promotional programs
 such as coupons; and

events outreach
 such as sponsorships and participation at events with
attendees from the target market.


 we implement
processes
 protocols and delivery systems leveraging state-of-the-art digital interactive media technology
 such as the internet
mobile communications
 and digital interactive signage
 to develop targeted
 effective
 quantifiable
 cost-effective and comprehensive
campaigns that can be efficiently delivered to local and regional markets.


segments in order to specialize in solutions that are designed to meet a specific industry's advertising needs. Our management
believes that by targeting such vertical markets sharing common needs
 we will be able to position Eurocan in a market niche that
will foster growth
 improve stability and secure market share. We are initially focusing on information-intensive vertical market
segments that are looking to change their approach to advertising from traditional methods and into measurable digital media.




clients based upon the hourly billing rates of our employees or agents. These hourly billing rates differ depending on the service
provided. All projects are estimated in full based on hourly billing rates and the number of hours estimated to complete the project

performance incentives tied to the quality of our services and the success of our media and advertising campaigns. Commissions
must be agreed upon by our clients before work commences.




and implementing the following services that our management believes would complement our suite of digital interactive media marketing
solutions:




to as &quot;software on demand&rdquo; is software that is deployed over the internet or is deployed to run behind a firewall on
a local area network or personal computer. With SaaS
 a provider licenses an application to customers as a service on demand
 through
a subscription
 in a &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; model. As a result
 SaaS enables businesses to avoid making a significant investment
in software.


 SaaS was widely deployed for sales force automation
and customer relationship management. More recently
 it has become a tool for many business tasks
 including computerized billing
invoicing
 human resource management
 financials
 content management
 collaboration
 document management
 and service desk management.
By developing and offering SaaS
 we will be able to further leverage advertising buys (purchase of space to place a web-based ad)
to clients with advertising placement on SaaS applications. Our clients will be able to offer a SaaS application
 such as Gmail
online at no charge and brand it with their unique marketing message. Revenue would be generated from banner ads and pay per click
ads that are placed on the SaaS application as well as the hosting fee for the application.


 we will also be able to provide our clients
with a lower-cost method by which to use software on an as needed basis rather than licensing all devices with all applications.
Through well-designed implementation and properly priced licenses
 our on-demand SaaS can provide license benefits without associated
complexity and without the cost of equipping devices with unneeded applications.


 we will be able to price applications on
a per-user basis and/or per business basis
 sometimes with a relatively small minimum number of users and often with additional
fees for extra bandwidth and storage. We anticipate that our SaaS revenue streams will initially be lower initially than traditional
software license fees
 but recurring and therefore more predictable
 much like maintenance fees for licensed software. We expect
SaaS fees to be a source of continuous revenue for Eurocan.


opportunity for revenue growth through both licensing and advertising. Our development of SaaS
 and the related licensing and advertising
opportunities they bring
 are expected to net out to approximately a 40 percent increase in our revenue.


initially focus on new markets like small business in our target vertical by creating a lower entry price point and a pay-as-you-go
model. We will develop an infrastructure flexible enough to allow channel partners to resell and re-brand our SaaS services
 which
will be simplified to better serve limited information technology resources. Simplifying the product and restricting the functionality
will prevent overlap with existing and future licensed products. Next
 we will manage the implementation process and own the move-add-change
requirements not handled by the customer. Finally we will allow partners to build value-added services on top of our solution by
bundling their own services or by adding business process/vertical experts.


24-30 months. We plan to hire 2-3 consultants to develop SaaS over the next 24 months
 with sales/marketing to commence in the
following nine months. The estimated projected costs associated with development and implementation are of SaaS are $300
000.



    
    


Other Income Streams from Emerging Digital Interactive Media
Applications


media products such as iPhone
 iPad
 Android and other smart phones and mobile communication devices as well as the extensive array
of mobile applications that go with them by developing customized media products for clients for office and business use
 shopping
travel
 music
 communications and more. These devices and applications create accessibility for the consumer and new market opportunities
for our clients. As new mobile technologies expand the concept of &ldquo;office&rdquo; or &ldquo;home
&rdquo; our clients&rsquo;
customers could receive product or service messages anywhere in the world.


mobile devices and applications we will be able to deliver greater visibility
 higher brand awareness and high impact creative
for our clients. Utilizing mobile applications and Smartphone technology as part of our clients&rsquo; marketing campaign strategy
will also enable us to better reach client prospects and consumers in a more targeted and effective way. Each of these campaigns
will be individualized to our clients&rsquo; needs and goals.


 there will be a learning
curve associated with familiarizing clients with what is available in mobile communications
 in the applications that can be used
and how they are used. Even the technology is itself an obstacle due to the rapid pace with which it changes. To address this
we plan to engage two mobile communications experts in the coming year who will be strictly devoted to mobile communications marketing.
Our first hire will be engaged as the team expert consultant and a recognized industry expert. This hire is projected to be completed
in the coming 4-6 months The consultant will assess the opportunities within the competitive landscape as they relate to current
clients. The second expert to be brought on as an employee with in-depth technical knowledge will be hired to work closely with
the consultant to fully carry out the project management and development of the technology.


is planned to be fully staffed and operational in 12-18 months
 at an estimated annual cost of $160
000. We expect that the development
of campaigns deployed through mobile applications and devices and the related advertising opportunities they bring will increase
our net revenue by 40 percent.




 the hosting of applications and web sites
as well as back-up maintenance has become a top priority. When websites are inaccessible
 or perform poorly
 those businesses with
an online presence are at risk of losing valuable corporate documents and files in addition to revenue and customer loyalty. To
enable our clients to maximize their internet exposure
 we intend to develop a managed hosting service. Managed hosting incorporates
web-based applications in a high performance
 centralized environment that can be accessed from anywhere
 anytime. As a managed
hosting service provider we would provide a dedicated team of engineers to proactively manage a client&rsquo;s infrastructure so
the client is no longer required to monitor servers
 create backups
 or update patches. Additionally
 clients outsourcing their
managed hosting services from us would be able to save on information technology costs related to internal maintenance.


environment
 our managed hosting service will also provide us with a low cost hosting solution for our SaaS applications. It will
furthermore provide a platform for the distribution of banner ads across web sites
 applications
 and mobile technologies. We believe
that these services will facilitate more diverse advertising opportunities and enable higher returns on advertising investments
for our clients
 with increased sales
 successful branding
 and ultimately more profits. We plan to implement managed hosting over
the next 24 months by leasing a dedicated server from an outside vendor. We estimate the cost of leasing this server to be under
$700 per month. We expect our managed hosting service to generate $500 per month in gross revenue per client
 resulting in as much
as a 20 percent increase in our net revenue.


hosting to oversee the migration of our clients&rsquo; data to ensure critical data is migrated smoothly to a new hosting environment.
This expert will also serve as an on-site client consultant when the migration commences. By offering the additional on-site consulting
services at an hourly rate to clients
 we estimate additional revenue of $1
000-$5
000 for each new client during the initial hosting
period
 which would vary depending on the amount of data and level of complexity. Hiring of that individual is expected to take
place within the coming 12-16 months. Once this professional is in place
 the hosting service is expected to be operational within
8-12 weeks.



    
    





both telemarketing and direct sales. We advertise our products and services through several media sources including trade journals
and online advertising. Over the next 12 months we intend to implement a sales and marketing strategy that will employ a number
of promotional tools to reach prospective clients and establish our brand. These tools will include the following:

 We will develop relationships with strategic
core partners that complement our digital interactive media services.

 We intend to establish arrangements
with select local media
 such as television and radio networks
 to produce high-impact commercials to promote our services and
drive prospective clients to our website.

: We will compile a comprehensive e-mail marketing
list of businesses in North America with an initial focus on client-rich
 major metropolitan areas on the East Coast (e.g. New
York
 Philadelphia)
 before expanding to other regions for a nationwide footprint. We plan to distribute advertising and marketing
strategy briefs to businesses such as
 Fortune 500 corporations
 retailers of consumer and business goods
 financial institutions
pharmaceutical companies
 educational institutions
 software developers
 high tech companies and many others. E-mails may contain
blogging strategy
 viral video examples
 benefits of search engine optimization
 etc.

: We will issue multiple press releases each
month describing new business developments. The releases will be distributed via PR Newswire
 both with traditional distribution
and on-line
 and posted to our web-site.

: We plan to produce videos demonstrating
our capabilities and include comments on strategies and the implementation of such strategies to prospective clients. The videos
will also include client testimonials.

: We will develop and distribute a marketing kit
for delivery to our prospective customers
 outlining our service offerings.

: We will update and upgrade our web site for
a more complete description of our Company and our services. Our web site will be search engine optimized to maximize traffic and
attention.

: We intend to create a blog site that is search
engine optimized and can be viewed on our home page. We will routinely comment on news
 stories
 and events regarding digital interactive
media or new media
 and provide strategic and tactical methods of leveraging these trends. Blogs will include video and the latest
techniques in the blogosphere.




and fragmented
 and we do not hold a significant competitive position within it. Our competitors include several integrated marketing
communications conglomerates such as
 Omnicom
 WPP
 Publicis and Interpublic
 and numerous small and mid-sized agencies that operate
independently. Many of our competitors are large
 well established companies with substantially larger operating staffs and greater
capital resources than we have and which have been engaged in advertising and marketing for a much longer time than we have.


 we expect
there to be significant competition from companies similar to ours
 as well as from larger and more established companies. Since
there are no substantial barriers to entry in this market
 our management believes that our ability to compete depends upon many
factors within and beyond our control
 including:



timing and market acceptance of new products and services developed
by the company and its competitors;





the ease of use
 performance
 price and reliability of the company's
products and services.

that planned services

 managed hosting and digital interactive media applications
 will further
complement our current suite of digital media capabilities.

which may potentially decrease our shareholders&rsquo; ability to easily transfer their shares. Broker-dealer practices in connection
with transactions in &quot;penny stocks&quot; are regulated. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less
than $5.00. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer
 prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the
rules
 to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny
stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock
 the compensation
of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction
 and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny
stock held in the customer's account. In addition
 the penny stock rules generally require that prior to a transaction in a penny
stock
 the broker-dealer make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and
receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the
level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that must comply with the penny stock rules. Since our shares must
comply with such penny stock rules
 our shareholders will in all likelihood find it more difficult to sell their securities.

of our plan of operation should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes. This discussion contains
forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties
 such as our plans
 objectives
expectations and intentions. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated
in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors
 including those set forth under &quot;Description of Business&quot;
and elsewhere in this annual report.



    
    





in digital interactive media. We utilize state-of-the-art digital interactive media technology to efficiently develop quantifiable
and comprehensive advertising and marketing campaigns. By utilizing digital interactive media such as the internet
 mobile communications
and digital interactive signage
 our management believes that we can implement highly targeted campaigns to a local and global
market quickly and cost effectively.


not presently sufficient to sustain our current level of operations for the next 12 months. Furthermore
 we anticipate that a minimum
of $500
000 will be required to expand the breadth and scope of our business (see &ldquo;Expansion of Business&rdquo;) and implement
our sales and marketing strategy (see &ldquo;Marketing Strategy&rdquo;). We plan to obtain the financing needed to sustain our
current operations and expand our business from a combination of capital sources and means
 including debt and equity financings.
Any future financing through equity investments will likely be dilutive to existing stockholders. Also
 the terms of securities
we may issue in future capital transactions may be more favorable for our new investors. Newly issued securities may include preferences
superior voting rights
 and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities
 which may have additional dilutive effects.
Further
 we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital and financing
 including investment banking fees
 legal fees
accounting fees
 printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in
connection with certain securities we may issue
 such as convertible notes and warrants
 which will adversely impact our financial
condition.


financing on terms satisfactory to us
 or at all
 and we do not have any arrangements in place for any future financing. Our ability
to obtain financing may be impaired by such factors as the capital markets
 both generally and specifically in the advertising
industry
 and the fact that we have not generally been profitable
 which could impact the availability or cost of future financings.
If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities together with our revenue from operations is not sufficient
to satisfy our capital needs
 we may be required to curtail
 suspend or discontinue some or all of our operations
 and investors
could lose some or all of their investment. We have no plans
 arrangements or contingencies in place in the event that we suspend
or discontinue operations.


communications expert who will be strictly devoted to mobile communications marketing
 and one full-time managed hosting specialist
to oversee our managed hosting service. We do not otherwise expect any significant increase in the number of our employees. We
intend to engage independent contractors on an &ldquo;as needed&rdquo; basis for the remainder of our personnel requirements
 including
sales and marketing
 media content production and technical consulting. Except for certain capital lease purchases of equipment
and systems for our managed hosting service
 our management does not anticipate engaging in any research or development or purchasing
any significant amount of equipment. Our ability to engage such personnel or to purchase any such equipment will be dependent upon
our ability to raise additional financing as discussed above
 of which there can be no assurance.




operations since inception. When our cash flows from operations have been insufficient
 our activities have been financed from
the proceeds of share subscriptions and loans from management and non-affiliated third parties. We expect to continue to incur
substantial losses to implement our business plan. We have not established any source of equity or debt financing and there can
be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to implement our business plan. As a result of the foregoing
 our
auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in our financial statements for the
year ended December 31
 2012. If we cannot continue as a going concern
 then investors may lose all of their investment.

of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatements. The Company is not required
to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration
of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining

management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

statements
 the Company has suffered losses from operations and has a working capital deficit. These conditions raise substantial
doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. Management&rsquo;s plans in regards to these matters are
also described in Note 3. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty.

 2004. Effective September 1
 2006
 the Company acquired 100% of the issued
and outstanding common stock of Michael Williams Web Design Inc. (&ldquo;MWWD&rdquo;); a private US based company
 in exchange
for 7

 2004 and was
owned by the President of the Company.


the sole shareholder of MWWD having voting and operating control of the combined company
 and
 prior to the acquisition
 the Company
was a non-operating shell corporation with nominal net assets. The acquisition was considered a capital transaction in substance
and therefore has been accounted for as a recapitalization. Under recapitalization accounting MWWD is considered the acquirer for
accounting and financial reporting purposes
 and acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities of the Company. Assets acquired
and liabilities assumed are reported at their historical amounts. These consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of the Company since the effective date of the recapitalization being September 1
 2006 and the historical accounts of the business
of MWWD since inception being February 26
 2004.

financial statements represent the consolidated operations of Eurocan Holdings Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiary MWWD. Intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.





financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to recoverability
of long-lived assets
 and deferred income tax asset valuations. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on currents facts
historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that
are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely
from the Company&rsquo;s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results
future results of operations will be affected.

 the Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate
that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include
 but are not limited to;
significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation
of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period
cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the

estimated useful life.


on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash
flow expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset
 as well as specific appraisal in certain instances.
An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. No impairment losses were
recognized for the years ended December 31
 2012 and 2011.





(loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260
 Earnings per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings
per share (&ldquo;EPS&rdquo;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available
to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (denominator) during the period.
Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including stock options
 using the
treasury method
 and convertible preferred stock
 using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS
 the average stock price
for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants.
Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. There were no common stock equivalents
as of December 31
 2012 and 2011. Therefore
 basic and diluted EPS are the same for the periods then ended.





liabilities approximate the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.

not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The Company is required to compute tax benefits for net
operating losses carried forward.


tax return with MWWD
 its subsidiary company. The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of
preparing the Company&rsquo;s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are &ldquo;more-likely-than-not&rdquo; of being
sustained by the applicable tax authorities. Tax positions deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as tax
benefits or expenses in the current year. Management has analyzed the company&rsquo;s tax positions taken on Federal tax returns
for all open tax years and has concluded that no provision for federal income tax is required in the Company&rsquo;s financial
statements. The Company files a Nevada state return which has no state corporation tax.

Accounting and Financial Disclosure





Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures


Form 10-K
 an evaluation was carried out by our management
 with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer (who are one and the same person)
 of the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;)) as of December
31
 2012. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed
or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized
 and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC
rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management
 including the Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief Financial Officer (who are one and the same person)
 to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.


 the Company&rsquo;s management concluded
as of the end of the period covered by this report
 that the Company&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.
Management intends to improve the adequacy of its disclosure controls and procedures during the course of 2013
 subject to available
resources.

Management&rsquo;s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting


and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule
13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by
 or under the supervision of
 the Company&rsquo;s
principal executive and principal financial officers
 or persons performing similar functions
 and effected by the Company&rsquo;s
Board of Directors
 management and other personnel
 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:



pertain to the maintenance of records
that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company&rsquo;s assets;


provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the Board of Directors;
and


provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
 or disposition of the Company&rsquo;s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.


effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2012
 based on criteria established
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(&ldquo;COSO&rdquo;). As a result of this assessment
 management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial
reporting.


 or a combination of deficiencies
in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company&rsquo;s
annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.





    
    




Due to limited resources and lack of segregation of duties
 documentation of the limited control structure has not been accomplished.

 To date
 the Company
has not established an Audit Committee. It is management&rsquo;s view that such a committee
 including a financial expert
 is an
utmost important entity level control over the financial reporting process.

.
The Company employs policies and procedures for reconciliation of its financial statements and note disclosures
 however
 these
processes are not appropriately documented. The Company has only one individual responsible for the preparation of the financial
records.


Management has not established methodical and consistent data back-up procedures to ensure loss of data will not occur.


financial reporting described above
 the Company&rsquo;s management has concluded that
 as of December 31
 2012
 the Company&rsquo;s
internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the criteria in Internal Control &ndash; Integrated Framework
issued by COSO.

 engaged our independent registered public accounting firm to perform an audit of internal control over financial
reporting pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management&rsquo;s report

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting


 there have
been no changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the year

 that materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect

control over financial reporting.

 Earnings per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of both&#13;basic and diluted earnings per share (&amp;#147;EPS&amp;#148;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing&#13;net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (denominator)&#13;during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including stock&#13;options
 using the treasury method
 and convertible preferred stock
 using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS
&#13;the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of&#13;stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. There were&#13;no common stock equivalents as of December 31
