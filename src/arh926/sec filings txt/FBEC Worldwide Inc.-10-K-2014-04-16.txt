&#160;On May 22, 2008, shareholders representing more than a majority of the Company outstanding shares voted to approve the Company&#8217;s 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan). The total number of shares of Common Stock that may be subject to awards under the Plan will not exceed five million shares, subject to customary adjustments as provided in the Plan.&#160;&#160;&#160;The Plan is generally designed to meet the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), in order to preserve the Company's ability to take compensation expense deductions in connection with the exercise of options granted and the vesting of performance-based restricted stock under the Plan.&#160;&#160;The Plan is to be administered by a committee comprised of not less than two individuals appointed by the Board of Directors, each of whom is (i) to the extent required by Rule 16b-3 and the Exchange Act, a non-employee director
 (the Plan). The total number of shares of Common Stock that may be subject to awards under the Plan will not exceed twenty-one million shares.&#160;&#160;&#160;The Plan is generally designed to meet the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), in order to preserve the Company's ability to take compensation expense deductions.&#160;&#160;The Plan is to be administered by a committee comprised of not less than two individuals appointed by the Board of Directors, each of whom is (i) to the extent required by Rule 16b-3 and the Exchange Act, a non-employee director

The Company purchased from Innovative Beverage Group
 Holdings
 Inc. its Trademarks and intellectual property rights of a beverage called &#8220;Unwind.&#8221;


Our mission is to supply the highest quality New Age/Alternative Beverages products at the most economical cost to distributors servicing the retail industry and directly to consumers through our website.&#160;&#160;Our service-oriented approach integrates the elements of research
 development
 product quality assurance
 packaging/distribution efficiency
 and advanced management systems to generate higher profit margins for our retailers.&#160;&#160;Collaboration with our distributors and retailers carrying our product is expected to build long-term relationships and help us manage our growth.


On October 9
 2013
 the Company entered into share exchange agreement to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding share capital with Gallant Acquisition Corp. (GAC) the 100% owner of all of the issued and outstanding share capital of 22 Social Club Productions (22 SCP) and its subsidiaries
 Blue 22 Entertainment and Appquest
 Inc. for 140
000
000 common shares of the Company and 5
000
000 shares of common stock of the Company to Appquest
 Inc. Effectively
 22 SCP held 89% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company and the transaction has been accounted for as a reverse merger
 where 22 SCP is deemed to be the acquirer and or the surviving entity for accounting purposes.


Blue 22 Entertainment possesses certain contracts for the production of live music concerts. The business plan calls for immediate expansion production and development of entertainment content including production of live events
 production and development of independent films
 reality TV and management and talent booking services.


We need additional capital to pursue our business plan and conduct our operations; however
 the ability to obtain the necessary and appropriate funding is uncertain.&#160;&#160;We intend to expand our product line
 either through development or acquisition
 and intend to hire sufficient sales personnel necessary for us to gain a greater distribution network for our products. We believe that we will require significant additional capital resources from outside sources including equity and/or debt financings in order to meet our goals and continue operations.&#160;&#160;We believe we need to raise between $500
000 and $600
000 in order to meet these goals.





The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;)
 which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern
 which is dependent upon the Company's ability to establish itself as a profitable business.&#160;&#160;At December 31
 2013
 the Company has an accumulated deficit of $2
466
131 and for the period from February 20
 2013 (date of inception) through December 31
 2013
 incurred net losses of $ 1
541
936.&#160;&#160;Management plans to increase operations to include the marketing of the Company's beverage products and concert promotions by obtaining additional funds through the issuance of securities or borrowings.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 management is of the opinion that marketing combined with additional funding will result in improved operations and cash flow in 2014 and beyond. However
 there can be no assurance that management will be successful in obtaining additional funding or in attaining profitable operations.





These consolidated financial statements have been modified the to reflect accounting for our acquisition as a reverse acquisition and reflect the operations of the acquired company for 2013 and no activity in 2012. All references to comparative data of Frontier Beverage have been removed for period prior to October 9
 2013.




















As of December 31
 2013
 our working capital deficit was $1
158
850
 our accumulated deficit was $2
466
131 and our deficit was approximately $1
158
850.&#160;&#160;Operating loss was approximately $1
186
461 for the period from February 20
 2013 (date of inception) through December 31
 2013.&#160;&#160;Net cash outlay from operations was $0 for the period from February 20
 2013 (date of inception) through December 31
 2013.


We began the operation of our current business plan in October 2013 and have not yet attained a level of revenue to allow us to meet our current overhead. We have historically reported net losses from operations and negative cash flows.&#160;&#160;Additionally
 we have not yet attained a level of revenues to allow us to meet our current overhead and we had zero cash at December 31
 2013.&#160;&#160;In view of these facts
 the continued successful operation of the Company is dependent upon us obtaining additional financing and achieving a positive cash flow while maintaining adequate liquidity.&#160;&#160;Based on our current marketing plan and expected sales demand
 we do not contemplate attaining profitable operations until 2014
 and there is no assurance that such an operating level can ever be achieved.&#160;&#160;We are dependent upon obtaining additional financing in order to adequately fund working capital
 infrastructure
 manufacturing expenses and sales and marketing expenses to gain market recognition
 so that we can achieve a level of revenue adequate to support our cost structure
 none of which can be assured.


Management believes it will be able to raise the capital required to execute the Company's business plan and become profitable; however
 due to conditions and influences out of our control
 including the current state of the national economy
 we cannot guarantee that profitability will be achieved or that it will be achieved in the stated time frame
 nor is there any assurance that such an operating level can ever be achieved.


We expect to spend substantial amounts on the development or acquisition of new businesses. Further
 we may not have sufficient resources to fully develop any new products unless we are able to raise additional financing on acceptable terms or secure funds from new or existing partners.&#160;&#160;We can make no assurances that additional financing will be available on favorable terms or at all.&#160;&#160;Additionally
 these conditions may increase the cost to raise capital. If additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities
 the issuance of such securities would result in dilution to our existing stockholders.&#160;&#160;Additionally
 these conditions may increase costs to raise capital and/or result in further dilution. Our failure to raise capital when needed would adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations
 and could force us to reduce or cease our operations.


We believe that over the next twelve (12) months
 we will be able to meet the costs of growth and public reporting with funds generated from operations and additional amounts generated through debt and equity financing.&#160;&#160;Although management believes that the required financing to fund product development and increasing inventory levels can be secured at terms satisfactory to the Company
 there is no guarantee these funds will be made available
 and if funds are available
 that the terms will be satisfactory to the Company.

In December 2001
 the SEC requested that all registrants list their most &#8220;critical accounting polices&#8221; in the Management Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a &#8220;critical accounting policy&#8221; is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company&#8217;s financial condition and results
 and requires management&#8217;s most difficult
 subjective or complex judgments
 often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We do not believe that any accounting policies currently fit this definition.




We do not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our results of operations
 financial position or cash flow.&#160;













Our Company is a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221; as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act
 and as such
 is not required to provide the information required under this Item.





All financial statements required by this Item are listed in Part IV
 Item 15 of this Form 10-K
 are presented beginning on Page F-1
 and are incorporated herein by this reference.




































pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;&#160;


provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparationof financial statements in accordance with GAAP
 and that receipts and expenditures of theCompany are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and&#160;


provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorizedacquisition
 use or disposition of the Company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on thefinancial statements.




Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


In connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements
 we have assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2013
 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
 or the COSO Framework.&#160;&#160;Management&#8217;s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls.&#160;&#160;Based on this evaluation
 management has determined that as of December 31
 2013
 our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective and there were weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as outlined below.





Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time period specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management
 as appropriate
 in order to allow timely decisions in connection with required disclosure.





Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)
 the Mr. Harris
 the Company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) (the Company&#8217;s principal financial and accounting officer)
 of the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report.


Based upon that evaluation
 the Company&#8217;s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30
 2013 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act
 is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms
 and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company&#8217;s management
 including the Company&#8217;s CEO and CFO
 as appropriate
 to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
 due to the material weaknesses described below.


A material weakness is a deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.


















The Company believes its weaknesses in internal controls and procedures is due to the Company's lack of sufficient personnel with expertise in the area of SEC
 generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and tax accounting procedures.&#160;&#160;In addition
 the Company lacks the personnel structure
 size and complexity to segregate duties sufficiently for proper controls.


The Company is currently without sufficient funds to hire additional personnel with expertise in these areas and to segregate duties for proper controls and until such time as additional personnel are hired
 the Company believes that it will continue to recognize a weakness in its internal controls and procedures.


The Company&#8217;s plan is to hire additional personnel to properly implement a control structure when the appropriate funds become available.&#160;&#160;In the meantime
 the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer will continue to perform or supervise the performance of additional accounting and financial analyses and other post-closing procedures including detailed validation work with regard to balance sheet account balances
 additional analysis on income statement amounts and managerial review of all significant account balances and disclosures
 to ensure that the Company's Annual Report and the financial statements forming part thereof are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.




There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31
 2013 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.





This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company&#8217;s registered public accounting firm pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
 wherein non-accelerated filers are exempt from Sarbanes-Oxley internal control audit requirements.

To the best of our knowledge

&#160;Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires each of our officers and directors and each person who owns more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the SEC an initial report of ownership and subsequent reports of changes in such ownership. Such persons are further required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms (including Forms 3
 4 and 5) that they file. Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms received by us with respect to fiscal year 2012
 or written representations from certain reporting persons
 we believe all of our officers and directors and persons who own more than 10% of our Common Stock have met all applicable filing requirements
 except as described in this paragraph.&#160;&#160;Mr. David Harris
 who was appointed to serve as a Director on November 15
 2011 and resigned March 21
 2013

Frontier Beverage Company
 Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Frontier Beverage Company
 Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December&#160;31
 2013 and the related consolidated statements of operations
 stockholders&#8217; deficit and cash flows for the period from February 20
 2013 (date of inception) through December 31
 2013. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
 assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion
 the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of Frontier Beverage Company
 Inc. at December&#160;31
 2013and the results of its operations for the period from February 20
 2013 (date of inception) through December 31
 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the&#160;United States of America.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.&#160;As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements
 the Company has sustained net losses from operations and stockholder&#8217;s deficit. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern.&#160;Management&#8217;s plans in regards to these matters are also described in Note 1.&#160;The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

FRONTIER BEVERAGE COMPANY
 INC.






Frontier Beverage Company
 Inc.
 f/k/a Assure Data
 Inc. (the Company
 &#8220;we&#8221;
 &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) is a Nevada corporation that was formed in November 2002 and commenced operations in April 2003. The Company provided fully automated remote data backup services for small to medium sized businesses.


The Company purchased from Innovative Beverage Group
 Holdings
 Inc. its Trademarks and intellectual property rights of a beverage called &#8220;Unwind.&#8221; See further information disclosed at 


On July 1
 2013
 controlling interest in the Company was sold to Ruben Yakubov who became the sole director and officer after the resignation of Terry Harris from all positions he had held since 2009. Following
 on July 10
 2013
 the Company increased its authorized common shares to 500
000
000
 par value $0.001 and 100
000
000 preferred shares
 par value $0.001.


On October 9
 2013
 the Company entered into share exchange agreement to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding share capital with Gallant Acquisition Corp. (GAC) the 100% owner of all of the issued and outstanding share capital of 22 Social Club Productions (22 SCP) and its subsidiaries
 Blue 22 Entertainment and Appquest
 Inc. for 140
000
000 common shares of the Company and 5
000
000 shares of common stock of the Company to Appquest
 Inc. Effectively
 22 SCP held 89% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company and the transaction has been accounted for as a reverse merger
 where 22 SCP is deemed to be the acquirer and or the surviving entity for accounting purposes.


The transaction is accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. As a result of the recapitalization and change in control
 22 SCP is the acquiring entity in accordance with ASC 805
 Business Combinations. Accordingly
 the historical financial statements are those of 22 SCP
 the accounting acquirer
 immediately following the consummation of the reverse merger.


22 Social Club Productions
 Inc. and Blue 22 Entertainment possess certain contracts for the production of live music concerts. The business plan calls for immediate expansion production and development of entertainment content including production of live events
 production and development of independent films
 reality television and management and talent booking services.


On December 31
 2013
 the Company sold 30% shares of 22 Social Club Productions
 Inc. to GAC
 a related party in return of 100
000
000 restricted common shares from the share exchange agreement entered into on October 9
 2013.





The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;)
 which contemplates continuation of the Company as a 
 which is dependent upon the Company's ability to establish itself as a profitable business.&#160;&#160;At December 31
 2013
 the Company has an accumulated deficit of $2
466
131
 and for the period from February 20
 2013 (date of inception) through December 31
 2013 incurred net loss of $1
541
936.&#160;&#160;Management plans to increase operations to include the marketing of the Company's beverage products and concert promotions by obtaining additional funds through the issuance of securities or borrowings. Accordingly

 there can be no assurance that management will be successful in obtaining additional funding or in attaining profitable operations
 and therefore
 these matters raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.&#160;&#160;These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties
 nor do they include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in operation.
























For purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows
 the Company considers amounts held by financial institutions and short-term investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash and cash equivalents.&#160;&#160;In the future
 the Company may periodically make deposits with financial institutions in excess of the maximum federal insurance limits (FDIC) of $250
000 per bank.





The Company adopted the SFAS guidance which requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and similar awards and applies to all outstanding and vested stock-based awards.&#160;&#160;In computing the impact
 the fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant based on the Black-Scholes options-pricing model utilizing certain assumptions for a risk free interest rate; volatility; and expected remaining lives of the awards. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management&#8217;s best estimates
 but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result
 if factors change and the Company uses different assumptions
 the Company&#8217;s stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition
 the Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. In estimating the Company&#8217;s forfeiture rate
 the Company analyzed its historical forfeiture rate

the remaining lives of unvested options
 and the amount of vested options as a percentage of total options outstanding. If the Company&#8217;s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate
 or if the Company reevaluates the forfeiture rate in the future
 the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period. Applying this guidance had no impact on the consolidated financial statements for the period from February 20
 2013 (date of inception) through December 31
 2013.





The Company calculates earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) in accordance with the SFAS guidance for Earnings per Share
 which requires the computation and disclosure of two EPS amounts
 basic and diluted.&#160;&#160;Basic EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period.&#160;&#160;Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding plus all potentially dilutive shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period.&#160;&#160;Such potential dilutive shares of Common Stock consist of stock options
 non-vested shares (restricted stock) and warrants.&#160;&#160;At December 31
 2013
 there were no potential shares of Common Stock that would have an anti-dilutive effect.





Potential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The Company has adopted ASC 740 &#8220;Accounting for Income Taxes&#8221; as of its inception. Pursuant to ASC 740
 the Company is required to compute tax asset benefits for net operating losses carried forward. The potential benefits of net operating losses have not been recognized in this financial statement because the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses carried forward in future years.

























The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts
 historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company&#8217;s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results
 future results of operations will be affected.




The Company assessed the classification of its derivative financial instruments as of December 31
 2013
 which consist of convertible instruments and rights to shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock
 and determined that such derivatives meet the criteria for liability classification under ASC 815.

ASC 815 generally provides three criteria that
 if met
 require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract
 (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional
 as described.














ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity&#8217;s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels
 which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:














Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical
 unrestricted assets or liabilities.



























Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability
 either directly or indirectly
 including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g.
 interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.

















Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of December 31
 2013. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. These financial instruments include accounts payable
 accrued compensation and accrued expenses. As of December 31
 2013
 the Company has determined that the only asset or liability measured at fair value is the derivative instrument related to an anti-dilution provision contained in Convertible Notes and valued using level 3 inputs..










 to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims
 assessments
 litigation
 fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. There were no commitments or contingencies as of December 31
 2013.









Professional standards generally provides three criteria that
 if met
 require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a)&#160;the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract
 (b)&#160;the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c)&#160;a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.&#160;&#160;Professional standards also provide an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional as defined under professional standards as &#8220;The Meaning of &#8220;Conventional Convertible Debt Instrument&#8221;.


The Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments) in accordance with professional standards when &#8220;Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features
&#8221; as those professional standards pertain to &#8220;Certain Convertible Instruments.&#8221; Accordingly
 the Company records
 when necessary
 discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their earliest date of redemption. The Company also records when necessary deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in preferred shares based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note.

ASC 815-40 provides that
 among other things
 generally
 if an event is not within the entity&#8217;s control could or require net cash settlement
 then the contract shall be classified as an asset or a liability.























The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed
 and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with the SFAS guidance for Accounting for Income Taxes
 which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns. Measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws. In the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset
 the guidance requires an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such assets. A valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized.




















The Company has net operating losses at December 31
 2013 of $1

The provisions of ASC 740 require companies to recognize in their financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit
 based upon the technical merits of the position. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition
 classification
 interest and penalties
 accounting in interim periods and disclosure.


Management does not believe that the Company has any material uncertain tax positions requiring recognition or measurement in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. Accordingly
 the adoption of these provisions of ASC 740 did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s financial statements. The Company&#8217;s policy is to record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions
 if any
 as income tax expense.

 2013
 the convertible notes agreement was amended to allow conversion into shares of common stock at 50% discount to the lowest bid of stock&#8217;s market price during the last 20 days prior to conversion date.


The Company identified embedded derivatives related to the amended Convertible Promissory Note entered into on October 9
 2013.&#160;These embedded derivatives included certain conversion features.&#160;The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record the fair value of the derivatives as of the inception date of the Convertible Promissory Note and to adjust the fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date.&#160;At the inception of the Convertible Promissory Note
 the Company determined a fair value of $240
369 of the embedded derivative.&#160;&#160;The fair value of the embedded derivative was determined using the Black Scholes Model based on the following assumptions:&#160;&#160;










































The initial fair value of the embedded debt derivative of $240
369 was allocated with accumulated deficit as part of recapitalization effect.


The fair&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; value of the described embedded derivative of $676
331 at December 31
 2013 was determined using the Black Scholes Model with the following assumptions:










































At December 31
 2013
 the Company adjusted the recorded fair value of the derivative liability to market resulting in non-cash
 non-operating loss of $435
962 for the period from February 20
 2013 (date of inception) through ended December 31
 2013.




ASC 825-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value
 the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability
 such as inherent risk
 transfer restrictions
 and risk of nonperformance. ASC 825-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 825-10 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:&#160;























To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market
 the determination of fair value requires more judgment. In certain cases
 the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases
 for disclosure purposes
 the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is disclosed is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.


Items recorded or measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the accompanying&#160;consolidated financial statements consisted of the following items as of December 31
 2013:
