In December 2019
 a novel strain of coronavirus (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) was identified in Asia. Over the next several months
 COVID-19 quickly spread across the world. In March 2020
 the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic. As of February 2021
 the virus continues to spread
 infecting more than 110 million people worldwide
 and impacting worldwide economic activity. In response to the pandemic
 many governments implemented policies intended to stop or slow the further spread of the disease
 such as social distancing and shelter-in-place orders. This has resulted in the temporary closure of schools and non-essential businesses. Because the Company sells products that are essential to the daily lives of consumers
 the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact to our consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31
While the duration and severity of this COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain
 the extent to which the pandemic ultimately impacts the Company&#8217;s business
 financial condition
 results of operations
 cash flows
 and liquidity may differ from management&#8217;s current estimates. The difference is due to inherent uncertainties regarding the duration and further spread of the outbreak
 its severity
 government actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact

These uncertainties make it challenging for our management to estimate our future business performance. However
Although the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our business operations in multiple ways
 our manufacturing facility remains fully operational to date and we have not experienced any meaningful disruption to our worldwide supply chain. &#160;Additionally
 nutritional supplements and health foods have been designated critical/essential infrastructure in the U.S. and
 as such
 we have continued to actively manufacture and distribute our products in our markets around the world. &#160;We will continue to communicate with our supply chain partners to identify and mitigate risk and to manage inventory levels. While our manufacturing and distribution employees continue to work on site

We develop and market products for consumers who want to lose weight and adopt a holistic approach to overall health and wellness. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (&#8220;CDC&#8221;)
 over 70.0% of all adults in the United States (US) aged 20 and above were overweight or obese in 2017-2018
According to a proprietary analysis
 the addressable market for weight loss is large and growing. It&#8217;s worth about $20.0 billion today with a growth rate of approximately 6.0% per annum. Additionally
 roughly 75.0% of the US population above 18 wants to lose weight and is open to dieting

Weight management is a challenge for a significant portion of the U.S. population
 as well as the global population. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
 overweight and obese individuals are increasingly at risk for diseases such as Type 2 diabetes
 heart disease
 certain types of cancer
 stroke
 arthritis
 sleep apnea and depression. In 2013
 The American Medical Association declared obesity a disease and the American Heart Association
 the American College of Cardiology
 and the Obesity Society jointly issued treatment guidelines recommending obesity be managed as a chronic disease. In 2016
 the World Health Organization estimates that approximately 1.9 billion people 18 years and older were overweight worldwide
Obesity is defined as a Body Mass Index (&#8220;BMI&#8221;) of 30 kg/m2 or greater
 whereas overweight is defined as a BMI ranging between 25 and 29.9 kg/m. In the United States
 more than two-thirds of the adult population fall within the overweight or obese categories and approximately 42.4% were obese in 2017. By 2017
 only two states and the District of Columbia had an obesity rate that was less than 25.0%; twenty-nine states had an adult obesity rate of 30.0% or higher. Being overweight and/or obese is linked to a multitude of serious comorbidities including heart disease
 stroke
 Type 2 diabetes
 certain types of cancers
 arthritis
 sleep apnea and depression. In fact
Consumers in the United States spend an estimated approximately $190.0 billion annually on obesity-related medical conditions; the average annual medical costs for those who are obese are more than $1
400 higher than those of people in a normal weight range. According to a 2019 study by Marketdata Enterprises
 the United States weight loss market itself is estimated to be a roughly $73.0 billion per year industry
 including consumer spending on diet foods
 drinks and low-calorie sweeteners
 health clubs
 fitness centers and workout videos; medically supervised and commercial weight loss programs; children&#8217;s weight loss camps; diet books; appetite suppressants and more. Portion-controlled
 meal-replacement weight management programs are continuing to gain popularity
 as consumers search for a safe and effective solution that provides balanced nutrition

 we were ranked in the DSA&#8217;s Top 20 list
Transparency is a core principal at Medifast. We adhere to the direct-selling industry&#8217;s highest ethical standards and best practices. We are a member in good standing of the DSA
 a well-known and widely respected national trade association representing over 100 direct selling companies in the United States. As a member of the DSA
The United States is our principal market and continues to represent significant potential for growth given the high percentage of overweight or clinically obese adults
 where over 70.0% of adults aged 20 and over were considered overweight or obese in 2017-2018. Sales of weight loss and health and wellness products and services are projected to grow at a compound average growth rate (&#8220;CAGR&#8221;) of approximately 7.0% in the United States through 2022
Industry growth is also being driven by growing consumer awareness and increasing demand for health and wellness products. The intensified interest in physical fitness
 fitness center membership
 increased public awareness and incidences of chronic diseases such as diabetes
 hypertension
 heart disease
 stroke
 osteoporosis and others have increased demand for health and wellness products. The nutrition and weight management segment of the industry continued to dominate the health and wellness market in 2020.
We are targeting our word of mouth and social media marketing toward increasingly younger demographics; reaching out to important and increasingly diverse communities of health and wellness consumers
As we previously disclosed
 global expansion is an important component of our long-term growth strategy. In July 2019
 we commenced our international operations
Like the United States
 we believe healthy lifestyles have increasingly become a priority to middle-class consumers in the Asia Pacific markets as disposable income grows. Our research has found that while traditional remedies are still essential

 with robust growth projected over the next several years. The region also is a leading direct selling marketplace

Demand for weight management products and programs are typically seasonal.  Traditionally
 the predisposition of consumers not to initiate a weight loss or management program during the holiday season impacts the fourth quarter with fewer sales of weight management products and services during these months.  January and February generally show increases in sales
 as these months are considered the commencement of the &#8220;diet season.&#8221; We believe our sales pattern does not follow the seasonality of our industry

In this section
Direct selling is regulated by various national
 state and local government agencies in the United States and foreign markets. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes
 including &#8220;pyramid&#8221; schemes
 which compensate participants primarily for recruiting additional participants without significant emphasis on product sales to consumers. The laws and regulations governing direct selling may be modified or reinterpreted from time to time
 which may cause us to modify our sales compensation and business models. In almost all of our markets
 regulations are subject to discretionary interpretation by regulators and judicial authorities. There is often ambiguity and uncertainty with respect to the state of direct selling and anti-pyramiding laws and regulations. In the United States
 for example
 federal law provides law enforcement agencies
 such as the Federal Trade Commission (the &#8220;FTC&#8221;)
 broad latitude in policing unfair or deceptive trade practices
 but does not provide a bright-line test for identifying a pyramid scheme. Several states have passed legislation that more clearly distinguishes between illegal pyramid schemes and legitimate multi-level marketing (&#8220;MLM&#8221;) business models. Recent settlements between the FTC and other direct selling companies and guidance from the FTC have addressed inappropriate earnings and lifestyle claims and the importance of focusing on consumers. These developments have created a level of ambiguity as to the proper interpretation of the law and related court decisions. For example
 in 2016
 the FTC entered into a settlement with another multi-level marketing company
 requiring the company to modify its business model
 including basing sales compensation and qualification only on sales to retail and preferred customers and on purchases by a distributor for personal consumption within allowable limits. Although this settlement does not represent judicial precedent or a new FTC rule
 the FTC has indicated that the industry should look at this settlement
 and the principles underlying its specific measures
 for guidance. If the requirements in this settlement lead to new industry standards or new rules
In 2018
 the FTC released its nonbinding Business Guidance Concerning Multi-Level Marketing (&#8220;MLM Guidance&#8221;). The MLM Guidance explains
 among other things
 the FTC&#8217;s views concerning lawful and unlawful compensation structures
 whether personal consumption by participants can be used in determining a MLM organization&#8217;s compensation structure
In 2019
 the FTC took aggressive actions against a multi-level marketing company
 alleging that the company operated an illegal pyramid scheme that deceived consumers into believing that they could earn significant income as distributors of its health and wellness products. The company eventually entered into a consent order with the FTC
 pursuant to which the company was permanently prohibited from using a multilevel compensation plan in the United States. We have taken additional steps to educate our Coaches on proper earnings claims. If our Coaches make improper claims
 or if regulators determine we are making any improper claims
 this could lead to an FTC investigation and could harm our business. 
Additionally
 in 2009 the FTC promulgated nonbinding Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising (&#8220;Endorsement Guides&#8221;) which explained what endorsement practices the FTC views as being unfair or deceptive acts or practices. In 2020
 the FTC sought public comments on whether the Endorsement Guides should be amended. The last time the FTC sought similar public comments led to a major revision of the Endorsement Guides. Consequently
 the FTC could bring an enforcement action based on practices that are inconsistent with the current Endorsement Guides as it considers revisions. Under the current Endorsement Guides
VIA has adapted its rules regarding the practices of its Coaches in order to comply with the current Endorsement Guides
We continue to monitor developments to assess whether we should make any changes to our business or compensation plan. If we are required to make changes or if the FTC seeks to enforce similar measures in the industry
 either through rulemaking or an enforcement action against our company

 the company established a relationship with an external partner to assess our work environment and identify 
opportunities in the area of Diversity
 Equity &amp; Inclusion (&#8220;DEI&#8221;). We have also planned leadership training and workshops
 to occur in 2021
Medifast is focused on attracting and retaining top talent who are eager to participate in our mission. Our Total Rewards Program is intended to deliver competitive compensation and benefits that align with our company mission and values. Annually
 we review our market reference ranges and the pay of our team members to ensure we are paying competitively
In 2020
 in response to COVID-19
 we immediately prioritized the health and wellbeing of our employees.  For our onsite essential employees
 we instituted enhanced safety protocols
 limited visitation to our plant and distribution center and rolled out additional sick leave (crisis pay) to allow our team members the time needed to cope should they get sick or have a sick family member. For our non-essential employees

You should consider carefully the following risks and uncertainties when reading this Report. If any of the events described below actually occurs
 the Company&#8217;s business
 financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties. Consequently
In both domestic and foreign markets
 we may be subject to challenges by government regulators regarding our direct selling model.  Legal and regulatory requirements concerning the direct selling industry generally do not include &#8220;bright line&#8221; rules and are inherently fact-based and subject to interpretation.  As a result
 regulators and courts have discretion in their application of these laws and regulations
Recent settlements between the FTC and other direct selling companies and guidance from the FTC have addressed inappropriate earnings and lifestyle claims and the importance of focusing on consumers. These developments have created a level of ambiguity as to the proper interpretation of the law and related court decisions. Any adverse rulings or legal actions could impact our business if direct selling laws or anti-pyramid laws are interpreted more narrowly or in a manner that results in additional burdens or restrictions on direct selling companies. For example
 in 2016
 the FTC entered into a settlement with another multi-level marketing company
 requiring the company to modify its business model
 including basing sales compensation and qualification only on sales to retail and preferred customers and on purchases by a distributor for personal consumption within allowable limits. Although this settlement does not represent judicial precedent or a new FTC rule
 the FTC has indicated that the industry should look at this settlement
 and the principles underlying its specific measures
Similarly
 in 2019
 the FTC took aggressive actions against a multi-level marketing company
VIA Coaches make improper claims regarding our products or business
 or if regulators determine we are making any improper claims
We continue to monitor developments to assess whether we should make any changes to our compensation structure. If we are required to make changes or if the FTC seeks to enforce similar measures in the industry
 either through rulemaking or an enforcement action against us
In addition
 the FTC has increased its scrutiny of the use of testimonials
 which we also utilize
 as well as the role of endorsers. We cannot be sure that the FTC will not challenge our advertising or other operations in the future
Governmental regulations in countries where we plan to commence or expand operations may prevent or delay entry into those markets. In addition
 our ability to sustain satisfactory levels of sales in our markets is dependent in significant part on our ability to introduce innovative products into such markets. However
 governmental regulations in our markets
 both domestic and international
 can delay or prevent the introduction
 or require the reformulation or withdrawal
 of certain of our products. Any such regulatory action
 whether or not it results in a final determination adverse to us
 could 
create negative publicity
VIA Coaches and
 consequently
We could also be subject to challenges by private parties in civil actions. We are aware of recent civil actions against other companies in the United States that use a direct selling model
 which have and may in the future result in significant legal costs. Allegations against companies that use a multi-level marketing strategy in various markets have also created intense public scrutiny of companies in the direct selling industry. Similarly
 the FTC continues to scrutinize multi-level marketers. In 2020
 the FTC sent out letters warning multi-level marketing companies to remove and address claims that they or their participants made about their products&#39; ability to treat or prevent COVID-19 or provide earnings for people who have recently lost income. All of these actions and any future scrutiny of us or the direct selling industry could generate negative publicity or further regulatory actions that could result in fines
 restrict our ability to conduct our business
 enter into new markets
We have experienced rapid growth and expect our growth to continue
 which could place significant strain on our management
 systems
 resources
We have experienced rapid growth and development in a relatively short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in the future.&#160; For example
VIA Coaches have grown from 31
800 as of December 31
 2019 to 44
200 as of December 31
 2020. In addition
 in July 2019
 we commenced our international operations
 entering into the Asia Pacific markets of Hong Kong and Singapore.&#160; We outsource a distribution center in Hong Kong for product distribution capacity. Our rapid growth places significant demands on our management and our administrative
 logistical
We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully optimize our distribution center network or open new distribution centers in new or existing markets if needed to accommodate or facilitate growth or that certain of our distribution centers will not have
 or continue to have
 operational challenges. Our ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth
 if any
 will depend on our ability to maximize operational efficiencies across our distribution center network
 to implement and improve on a timely basis operational
 financial and management information systems
 including our warehouse management systems
 and to expand
 train
 motivate and manage our work force. We cannot assure you that our existing personnel
 systems
Our failure to effectively manage our growth could harm our business and reputation and
 in particular
 our financial condition
 results of operations and cash flows
 which could negatively affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our common stock. Our growth could also increase our capital requirements
We rely on third parties to provide us with a majority of the products we sell and we manufacture the remaining portion. We also rely on third parties to distribute and deliver our products.  The inability to obtain the necessary products from our third-party manufacturers
 produce the products we manufacture in-house or distribute and deliver our products could cause our revenue
We rely on third-party manufacturers to supply a significant portion of the food and other products we sell. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity
 quality and variety of foods and other products from these manufactures in a timely and low-cost manner
 we will be unable to fulfill our clients&#8217; orders in a timely manner
 which may cause us to lose revenue and market share or incur higher costs
Therefore
 it is critical that we maintain good relationships with our manufacturers and third parties that distribute and deliver our products. The services we require from these parties may be disrupted due to a number of factors associated with their businesses
 including the following:
severe weather
natural or man-made disasters
 war
 terrorism
We manufacture and produce the majority of our powder-based products
 which account for approximately 46% of our unit sales
 at our manufacturing facility in Owings Mills
 Maryland.  As a result
 we are dependent upon the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our sole manufacturing facility in Owings Mills
 Maryland.  The operations at this facility may be disrupted by a number of factors
severe weather
natural or man-made disasters
 war
 terrorism
There can be no assurance that the occurrence of these or any other operational problems at our sole facility would not have a material adverse effect on our business
Our ability to source quality ingredients and other products is critical to our business
We depend on frequent deliveries of ingredients and other products from domestic and foreign suppliers
 especially for our non-powder products. Some of our suppliers may depend on a variety of other local
 regional
 national and international suppliers to fulfill the purchase orders we place with them.  The availability of such ingredients and other products at competitive prices depends on many factors beyond our control
We rely on our suppliers
 and their supply chains
 to meet our quality and production standards and specifications and supply ingredients and other products in a timely and safe manner. However

 below our quality standards or improperly labeled.  In addition to a negative customer experience
Furthermore
 there are many factors beyond our control which could cause shortages or interruptions in the supply of our ingredients and other products
 including adverse weather
 climate and environmental factors
 natural disasters
 unanticipated demand
 labor or distribution problems
 changes in law or policy
 food safety issues by our suppliers and their supply chains
 and the financial health of our suppliers and their supply chains.  Production or yield of the 
agricultural crops that are used as ingredients in our products may also be materially adversely affected by drought
 water scarcity
 temperature extremes
 scarcity of agricultural labor
 changes in government agricultural programs or subsidies
 import restrictions
 scarcity of suitable agricultural land
 crop conditions
 crop or animal diseases or crop pests. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential effect of such events
 or to effectively manage such events if they occur
 may materially adversely affect our business
 financial condition and operating results
In addition
 unexpected delays in deliveries from suppliers or increases in transportation costs (including through increased fuel costs) could materially adversely affect our business
 financial condition and operating results.  Labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry
 long-term disruptions to the national transportation infrastructure
 reduction in capacity and industry-specific regulations such as hours-of-service rules that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could also materially adversely affect our business
We currently source certain of our ingredients from suppliers located outside of the United States.  Any event causing a disruption or delay of imports from suppliers located outside of the United States
 including weather
 drought
 crop-related diseases
 the imposition of import or export restrictions
 restrictions on the transfer of funds or increased tariffs
 destination-based taxes
added taxes
 quotas or increased regulatory requirements
 could increase the cost or reduce the supply of our ingredients and the other materials required by our product offerings
 which could materially adversely affect our business
 financial condition and operating results.  Furthermore
 our suppliers&#8217; operations may be adversely affected by political and financial instability
 resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries
 restrictions on the transfer of funds or other trade disruptions
VIA Coaches are independent contractors and
 accordingly
VIA Coaches were our own employees. As a result
VIA Coaches will comply with our policies and procedures. Additionally
VIA Coaches do not have extensive training or certification in nutrition
VIA Coaches have provided inappropriate advice or have inappropriately referred or failed to refer clients to health care providers for matters other than weight loss. Such claims could result in lawsuits
 damage to our reputation and divert management&#8217;s attention from our business
Our weight loss and weight management programs do not include medical treatment or medical advice
 and we do not engage physicians or nurses to monitor the progress of our clients. Many people who are overweight suffer from other physical conditions
 and our target consumers could be considered a high-risk population. A customer who experiences health problems could allege or bring a lawsuit against us on the basis that those problems were caused or worsened by participating in our programs.  Further
 clients who allege that they were deceived by any statements that we made in advertising or labeling could bring a lawsuit against us under consumer protection laws. From time-to-time we are subject to such allegations and have been involved in such litigation. We may ultimately be unsuccessful in defending ourselves against such claims. Also
 defending ourselves against such claims
 regardless of their merit and ultimate outcome
 may be lengthy and costly
 and could adversely affect our brand image
 customer loyalty and results of operations. 
The weight management industry is highly competitive. If any of our competitors or a new entrant into the market with significant resources pursues a weight management program similar to ours
Competition is intense in the weight management industry and we must remain competitive in the areas of program efficacy
 price
 taste
 customer service and brand recognition. Our competitors include companies selling pharmaceutical products and weight loss programs
 digital tools
 app-based health and wellness monitoring solutions and wearable trackers
 as well as a wide variety of diet foods and meal replacement bars and shakes
 appetite suppressants and nutritional supplements. Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater resources. Any increased competition from new entrants into our industry or any increased success by existing competition could result in reductions in our sales or prices
 or both
The weight management industry is subject to changing consumer demands based
 in large part
 on the efficacy and popular appeal of weight management programs. The popularity of weight management programs is dependent
 in part
 on their ease of use
 cost and channels of distribution as well as consumer trends
 which continue to evolve with the introduction of new technologies and innovations
 and
 on an ongoing basis
 many existing and potential providers of weight loss solutions
 including many pharmaceutical firms with significantly greater financial and operating resources than we have
 are developing new products and services. The creation of a weight loss solution
 such as a drug therapy
 that is perceived to be safe
If we do not continue to develop innovative new services and products or if our services and products do not continue to appeal to the market
 or if we are unable to successfully expand or respond to consumer trends
The increasing focus of consumers on more integrated lifestyle and fitness approaches rather than just food
 nutrition and diet could adversely impact the popularity of our programs. Our future success depends on our ability to continue to develop and market new
 innovative services and products and to enhance our existing services and products
 each on a timely basis to respond to new and evolving consumer demands
 achieve market acceptance and keep pace with new nutritional
 weight management
 technological and other developments. We may not be successful in developing
 introducing on a timely basis or marketing any new or enhanced services and products
 and we cannot assure you that any new or enhanced services or products will appeal to the market. Our failure to develop new products and services and to enhance our existing products and services
 and the failure of our products and services to continue to appeal to the market could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain clients and thus adversely affect our business
We may not be able to successfully implement new strategic initiatives
We are continuously evaluating changing consumer preferences and the competitive environment of our industry and seeking out opportunities to improve our performance through the implementation of selected strategic initiatives. The goal of these efforts is to develop and implement a comprehensive and competitive business strategy which addresses the continuing changes in the weight management industry environment and our position within the industry. For example
 as the healthcare industry continues to evolve its response to the obesity epidemic
 so do the requirements
 both regulatory and business
 for providers. If we do not successfully meet these requirements
 we may not be perceived as an appropriate partner for certain purposes. We may not be able to successfully implement our strategic initiatives and realize the intended business opportunities
 growth prospects
 including new business units
 and competitive advantages. Our efforts to capitalize on business opportunities may not bring the intended results. Assumptions underlying expected financial results or consumer demand may not be met or economic conditions may deteriorate. We also may be unable to attract and retain highly qualified and skilled personnel to implement our strategic initiatives. If these or other factors 
limit our ability to successfully execute our strategic initiatives
 our business activities
Our business depends on the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing programs
 Coaches&#8217; social media presence
 to attract and retain clients. Use of social media may materially and adversely affect our reputation or subject us to fines or other penalties
VIA Coaches support our clients and market our products and services primarily through word of mouth
 email and via social media channels such as Facebook
 Instagram
 Twitter and video conferencing platforms. If their advertising and marketing campaigns do not generate a sufficient number of clients
 our business
VIA Coaches
 as well as social media influencers or other brand ambassadors that we may utilize from time to time
 use email and social media platforms as a means of communicating with consumers. We use digital marketing
 social media
 and email marketing
 among other means
 to attract and retain clients. Unauthorized or inappropriate use of these channels could result in harmful publicity or negative consumer experiences
 which could have an adverse impact on the effectiveness of our marketing through these channels. In addition
 the rising popularity of social media and other consumer-oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination. Our target consumers often value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Negative or false commentary about us may be posted on social media platforms or similar devices at any time and may harm our business
 brand
 reputation
 Coaches
 financial condition
 and results of operations
An increase in the use of social media for product promotion and marketing may cause an increase in the burden on us to monitor compliance of such materials and increase the risk that such materials could contain problematic product or marketing claims in violation of applicable regulations. As laws and regulations
 including FTC enforcement
 rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices
 the failure by us
 our employees
 or our Coaches or other third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our business
In addition
 as we continue to expand our presence domestically and internationally
 we
VIA Coaches and clients may face more restrictions and increasingly complex regulations on free use and access to social media platforms. Restrictions on the use of or access to social media
 especially in foreign countries that impose stricter regulations around free speech
 access to independent news or citizens&#8217; use of foreign communications tools deemed harmful to political or economic interests
 may adversely impact sales of our products and services. Even where the restrictions on social media or censorship are narrowly tailored or targeted

We are dependent on our key executives for future success. If we lose the services of any of our key executives and we are unable to timely retain a qualified replacement
Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills
 experience and efforts of our key executives. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could harm our business. We have not obtained life insurance on any key executives. If any key executives left us or were seriously injured and became unable to work
We rely on software
 hardware
 network systems
 including cloud-based technology
 that is either developed by us or licensed from or maintained by third parties to operate our websites. As much of this technology is complex
 there may be future errors
 defects or performance problems
 including when we update our technology or integrate new technology to expand and enhance our capabilities. Our technology may malfunction or suffer from defects that become apparent only after extended use. The integrity of our technology may also be compromised as a result of third-party cyber-attacks
 such as hacking
 spear phishing campaigns and denial of service attacks
 which are increasingly negatively impacting companies. In addition
 our operations depend on our ability to protect our information technology systems against damage from third-party cyber-attacks
 fire
 power loss
 water
 earthquakes
 telecommunications failures and similar unexpected adverse events. Interruptions in our websites
 services and products or network systems could result from unknown technical defects
 insufficient capacity or the failure of our third-party providers to provide continuous and uninterrupted service. While we maintain disaster recovery capabilities to return to normal operation in a timely manner
As a result of such possible defects
 failures
 interruptions or other problems
 our services and products could be rendered unreliable or be perceived as unreliable by clients
Our business is subject to online security risks
Unauthorized users who penetrate our information security systems could misappropriate proprietary or customer information or data or cause interruptions to the product offerings on our website. As a result
 it may become necessary to expend significant additional amounts of capital and resources to protect against
 or to alleviate
 problems caused by unauthorized users. These expenditures
 however
 may not prove to be a timely remedy against unauthorized users who are able to penetrate our information security systems. In addition to purposeful security breaches
 the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could adversely affect our computer systems and
 in turn
Existing
 proposed or new data privacy legislation and regulations
 including interpretations thereof
 could also significantly affect our business. For example
 data protection and privacy laws have been enacted by the U.S. federal and state governments
 including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
 which became effective on January 1
 
2020
 and other relevant statutes. These laws typically impose significant penalties for non-compliance. Further
 a significant number of states require that customers be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of their personal financial account or other information. Additional states and governmental entities are considering such &#8220;notice&#8221; laws. In addition
 other public disclosure laws may require that material security breaches be reported. If we experience a security breach and such notice or public disclosure is required in the future
 our reputation and our business may be harmed. The effects of these new and evolving laws
 regulations
 and other obligations potentially are far-reaching and may require us to further modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. In addition
 if we choose to continue expanding our business internationally in the future we may be subject to non-U.S. privacy
 data protection
 consumer protection and other laws and regulations
 which in some cases are more restrictive than those in the United States.  For example
 the European Union traditionally has imposed stricter obligations under such laws than the United States. Consequently
 any future expansion of our international operations may require changes to the ways we collect and use consumer information. In the ordinary course of our business
 we collect and utilize proprietary and customer information and data. As a result
 we have developed systems that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent transactions and other security breaches. Privacy concerns among prospective and existing clients regarding our use of such information or data collected on our website or through our services and products
 such as weight management information
 financial data
 email addresses and home addresses
 could keep them from using our website or purchasing our services or products. We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information and data. Businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for their use and handling of such information and data. We rely on third-party software products to secure our credit card transactions. Failure to prevent or mitigate fraudulent payment transactions or security breaches or changes in industry standards or regulations may adversely affect our business and operating results or cause us to lose our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment and result in chargebacks of fraudulently charged amounts. Furthermore
Third parties may infringe on our brand
 trademarks and other intellectual property rights
We currently rely on a combination of trademark and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights
 including our brand. Because our business relies heavily on a direct-to-consumer business model
 our brand is an important element of our business strategy.  If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights
 the value of our brand
 services and products could be diminished and our business may suffer. Additionally
 failure to protect our intellectual property could result in the entry of a competitor to the market. Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property by state actors
 competitors
 or individuals or groups that are or are not affiliated with the Company. Any legal action that we may bring to protect our brand and other intellectual property could be unsuccessful and expensive and could divert management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns. In addition
 legal standards relating to the validity
 enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property
 especially in Internet-related businesses
Third parties may
 in the future
 make claims against us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property claims
 regardless of merit
 could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could significantly divert management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns. In addition
 if we were unable to successfully defend against such claims
 we may have to pay damages
 stop selling the service or product or stop using the software
 technology or content found to be in violation of a third-party&#8217;s rights
 seek a license for the infringing service
 product
 software
 technology or content or develop alternative non-infringing services
 products
 software
 technology or content. If we cannot license on reasonable terms
 develop alternatives or have to stop using the service
 product
 software
 technology or content for any infringing aspects of our business
 we may be forced to limit our service and 
product offerings. Any of these results could reduce our revenue and our ability to compete effectively
In connection with our entry into the Asia Pacific markets of Hong Kong and Singapore
 we expanded our sales
 marketing and distribution activities in these markets.  The sale
 marketing and distribution of our products and programs in these and other international locations is subject to a number of uncertainties
 including
 but not limited to
changes in regulatory requirements
 including regulations governing our direct selling business model
These uncertainties could lead to potential risks for our continued expansion and sales success in the Asia Pacific markets and elsewhere
 any of which could harm our business
Expansion into international markets increases our operational
In July 2019
 we commenced our international operations
 entering into the Asia Pacific markets of Hong Kong and Singapore.  As a result
 we face increased operational
 regulatory
 compliance and reputational risks. The failure of our compliance and internal control systems to properly mitigate such additional risks
 or of our operating infrastructure to support such expansion
 could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions. Our operations in Hong Kong and Singapore and other jurisdictions are subject to significant compliance
 disclosure and other obligations. Activity in international markets also exposes us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates
 which may adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of revenues
 expenses and assets associated with our business activities outside the United States. Actual and anticipated changes in current exchange rates may also adversely affect international demand for our business investment strategies to expand our products and services
 most of which represent investments primarily in U.S. dollar-based assets. Because certain of our costs to support international business activities will be based in local currencies
If we expand our operations into additional foreign countries
 we may be subject to additional risks
 including the ability to successfully adapt to local culture and navigate regulatory
 economic
 political and social risks. We cannot be certain that we will be able to enter and successfully compete in additional foreign markets or that we will be able to continue to compete in the foreign markets in which we currently operate.
We are subject to anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate
 including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (&#8220;FCPA&#8221;). Our failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business
We are subject to the FCPA
 which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits
 along with various other anticorruption laws. There is no assurance that the policies
 procedures and training for all employees
 including management
 that were designed to ensure that we
 our employees and other intermediaries comply with the FCPA and other anticorruption laws to which we are subject
Expansion of our operations in international markets
 such as Hong Kong
 Singapore and other jurisdictions
 may pose elevated risks of anti-corruption violations as we are in frequent contact with persons who may be considered &#8220;foreign officials&#8221; under the FCPA
 resulting in an elevated risk of potential FCPA violations. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities (including local laws)
 we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures
 which could have an adverse impact on our business
 financial condition
 results of operations and liquidity. Any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anticorruption laws by U.S. or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business
Our business in Hong Kong and Singapore is subject to sensitive economic
 political
Entering the Asia Pacific markets of Hong Kong and Singapore is a key component of our global growth strategy. Our business in these countries is sensitive to economic
 political
Our program features pre-packaged food selections
 which we believe offer convenience and value to our clients. Our continued success depends
 to a large degree
 upon the continued popularity of our program versus various other weight loss
 weight management and fitness regimens
 such as low carbohydrate diets
 appetite suppressants and diets featured in the published media. Changes in consumer tastes and preferences away from our pre-packaged food and support and counseling services
 and any failure to provide innovative responses to these changes
 may have a materially adverse impact on our business
 financial condition
 operating results
 cash flows and prospects. Our success is also dependent on our food innovation including maintaining a robust array of food items and improving the quality of existing items. If we do not continually expand our food items or provide clients with items that are desirable in taste and quality
The weight loss industry is subject to adverse publicity
The weight loss industry receives adverse publicity from time to time
 and the occurrence of such publicity could harm us
 even if the adverse publicity is not directly related to us. Congressional hearings about practices in the weight loss industry have also resulted in adverse publicity and a consequent decline in the revenue of weight loss businesses. Future research or investigative reports or publicity that is perceived as unfavorable or that question certain weight loss programs
 products or methods could result in a decline in our revenue. Because of our dependence on consumer perceptions
 adverse publicity associated with illness or other undesirable effects resulting from the consumption of our products or similar products by competitors
 whether or not accurate
 could also damage customer confidence in our weight loss program and result in a decline in revenue. Adverse publicity could arise even if the unfavorable effects 
Our industry is subject to federal
 state and other governmental regulation. Certain federal and state agencies
 such as the FTC and the U.S. states&#8217; consumer protection agencies
 regulate and enforce laws relating to advertising
 disclosures to consumers
 privacy
 consumer pricing and billing arrangements and other consumer protection matters. A determination by a federal or state agency
 or a court
 that any of our practices do not meet existing or new laws or regulations could result in liability
 adverse publicity
 and restrictions of our business operations. Some advertising practices in the weight loss industry have led to investigations from time to time by the FTC and other governmental agencies. Many companies in the weight loss industry
 including our predecessor businesses
 have entered into consent decrees with the FTC relating to weight loss claims and other advertising practices. In 2009
 the FTC promulgated nonbinding Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising (&#8220;Endorsement Guides&#8221;) which explained what endorsement practices the FTC views as being unfair or deceptive acts or practices. In 2020
 the FTC sought public comments on whether the Endorsement Guides should be amended. The last time the FTC sought similar public comments led to a major revision of the Endorsement Guides. Consequently
 the FTC could bring an enforcement action based on practices that are inconsistent with the current Endorsement Guides as it considers revisions. Under the current Endorsement Guides
 advertisements that feature a consumer and convey his or her atypical experience with a product or service are required to clearly disclose the typical results that consumers can generally expect. We cannot be sure that the FTC will not challenge our advertising or other operations in the future
Other aspects of our industry are also subject to government regulation. For example
 the labeling and distribution of food products
 including dietary supplements
 are subject to strict USDA and FDA requirements and food manufacturers are subject to rigorous inspection and other requirements of the USDA and FDA
 and companies operating in foreign markets must comply with those countries&#8217; requirements for proper labeling
 controls on hygiene
 food preparation and other matters. If federal
 state
 local or foreign regulation of our industry increases for any reason
 then we may be required to incur significant expenses
 as well as modify our operations to comply with new regulatory requirements
 which could harm our operating results. Additionally
 remedies available in any potential administrative or regulatory actions may include product recalls and require us to refund amounts paid by all affected clients or pays other damages
Laws and regulations directly applicable to communications
 operations or commerce over the Internet such as those governing intellectual property
 privacy
 libel and taxation
 are more prevalent and remain unsettled. If we are required to comply with new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations
 or if we are unable to comply with these laws
 regulations or interpretations
Future laws or regulations
 including laws or regulations affecting our marketing and advertising practices
 relations with consumers
 employees
 service providers
 or our services and products
Like other manufacturers and distributors of products that are ingested
 we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of our products results in illness or injury. The foods and products that we manufacture and sell in the United States are subject to laws and regulations
 including those administered by the USDA and FDA that establish manufacturing practices and quality standards for food products. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business as existing insurance coverage may not be adequate. Distributors of weight loss food products
 including dietary supplements
 have been named as defendants in product liability lawsuits from time to time. The successful assertion or settlement of an uninsured claim
 a significant number of insured claims or a claim exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage would harm us by adding costs to the business and by diverting the attention of senior management from the operation of the business. We may also be subject to claims that our products contain contaminants
 are improperly labeled
 include inadequate instructions as to use or inadequate warnings covering 
interactions with other substances. Additionally
 the manufacture and sale of these products involves the risk of injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination. Product liability litigation
 even if not meritorious
 is very expensive and could also entail adverse publicity for us and reduce our revenue. Furthermore
 the products we manufacture and distribute
 or certain components of those products
 may be subject to product recalls or other deficiencies. Any negative publicity associated with these actions would adversely affect our brand and may result in decreased product sales and
 as a result
Actions of activist stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs
 divert management&#39;s attention and resources
We have been the target of activist stockholder activities in the past. If a new activist investor purchased our stock
 our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming
 disruptive to our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. In addition
 perceived uncertainties as to our future direction
 strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist stockholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities
 harm our ability to attract new investors

 suppliers and other strategic partners
The Company declared a dividend of $1.13 per share on December 10
 2020
 to stockholders of record as of December 22
 2020 that was paid on February 5
 2021.  We intend to continue paying a quarterly dividend to our stockholders for the foreseeable future
 subject to long term cash flow needs
 including capital spend needs and overall macroeconomic conditions. Our Board of Directors periodically reviews our quarterly dividend to ensure that it is in the best interest of our stockholders and is in compliance with all applicable laws and agreements. Future dividends may also be affected by
 among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions; legal risks; any stock repurchase programs; changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; changes to our business model; and interest and principal payments required by indebtedness that we may incur in the future. Our dividend payments may change from time to time
Provisions in our certificate of incorporation may deter or delay an acquisition of us or prevent a change in control
Provisions of our certificate of incorporation (as amended) may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a third-party from acquiring control of us
 even if our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market prices. In addition
Our certificate of incorporation (as amended) permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval upon such terms as the Board of Directors may determine. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be junior to
 and may be adversely affected by
 the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third-party to acquire
 or discourage a third-party from acquiring
 a majority of our outstanding common stock. The issuance of a substantial number of preferred shares could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
The global outbreak of COVID-19 may have a significant adverse impact on our business as well as on the business environment and the markets in which we operate. This global health crisis has also had a significant adverse effect on overall economic conditions and we expect consumer demand to continue to be negatively impacted due to changes in consumer behavior and confidence and health concerns. The situation remains dynamic and subject to rapid and possibly significant change
The widespread health crisis also could adversely affect the economies and financial markets in the countries in which we operate
 resulting in an economic downturn that could affect consumer demand for our products and services. Our customer purchasing patterns can be influenced by economic factors. The precise impact on our business from the disruption of financial markets and the weakening of overall economic conditions cannot be predicted with certainty. Uncertainties regarding the economic impact of COVID-19 have resulted in
 and are likely to continue to result in
 sustained impact on the economy. Our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending
 which may be adversely impacted by a recession or fears of a recession
 volatility and declines in the stock market and increasingly pessimistic consumer sentiment due to perceived or actual economic and/or health risks. Consumers may shift purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings during economic downturns. Prolonged unfavorable economic conditions
 including as a result of COVID-19
 and any resulting recession or slowed economic growth

 it may also have the effect of heightening the risks related to the other risk factors described in Part I
VIA Coaches.  A downturn in general economic conditions
 such as a recession or prolonged economic slowdown
 may reduce the demand for our products and otherwise adversely affect our sales. For example
 economic forces
 including changes in disposable consumer income and/or reductions in discretionary spending
 unemployment levels
 demographic trends
 and consumer confidence in the economy
 may cause consumers to defer or decrease purchases of our products and programs which could adversely affect our revenue
 gross profit
Our stock price fluctuates from time to time and may fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors
 and could subject us to litigation
The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors
 many of which are out of our control. These factors include: quarterly variations in operating results; changes in accounting treatments or principles; announcements by us or our competitors of new products and services offerings; significant contracts
 acquisitions
 or strategic relationships; additions or departures of key personnel; any future sales of our common stock or other securities; stock market price and volume fluctuations of publicly-traded companies; and general political
 economic and market conditions. In some future quarter our operating results may fall below the expectations of 
securities analysts and investors
 which could result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock. In the past
 securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may be the target of similar litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management&#39;s attention and resources
If we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting
Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. In the future
 if we identify a control deficiency that rises to the level of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting
 this material weakness may adversely affect our ability to record
 process
 summarize and report financial information timely and accurately and
 as a result
 our financial statements may contain material misstatements or omissions.  If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting
 we could be required to take costly and time-consuming corrective measures
 to remedy any number of deficiencies
 significant deficiencies or material weaknesses
 be required to restate the affected historical financial statements
 be subjected to investigations and/or sanctions by federal and state securities regulators
The Company owns a 49

The Company is
 from time to time
 subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings that arise out of the ordinary course of its business.  Based upon the Company&#8217;s experience
 current information and applicable law
 it does not believe that these proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations
 financial position or liquidity. However
 the results of legal actions cannot be predicted with certainty. Therefore
 it is possible that the Company&#8217;s results of operations
 financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more legal actions.

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
 the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management 
develops
 and changes periodically
 these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management considers the following accounting policies to be the most critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements. These critical accounting policies have been discussed with our Audit Committee

Our performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time. Revenue from products transferred to clients at a point in time accounted for substantially all of our revenue for the years ended December 31
 2020
 2019 and 2018. Revenue on these contracts is recognized when the obligations under the terms of the contract with our customer are satisfied. Generally
Our sales contracts may give clients the option to purchase additional products priced at a discount. Options to acquire additional products at a discount can come in many forms
 such as customer reward programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements
We reduce the transaction price for certain customer reward programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements
 promotions
 and incentives that represent variable consideration and separate performance obligations. The Company accounts for sales rewards that provide the customer with a material right as a separate performance obligation of the transactions
We expense sales commissions and credit card fees during the period in which the corresponding revenue is earned. These costs are deferred along with the revenues for goods that are in transit and not received by clients by period end. These costs are recorded in selling
 We continually assess the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors

We evaluated our tax positions and determined that we did not have any material uncertain tax positions. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense. For the&#160;years ended December&#160;31
 2020
 2019 and 2018
 no material estimated interest or penalties were recognized for the uncertainty of certain tax positions. We file income tax returns in the United States and various states and foreign jurisdictions. We are generally no longer subject to United States federal
 The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and categorizes leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. All the Company&#8217;s leases are operating leases. The right-of-use (&#8220;ROU&#8221;) assets represent the Company&#8217;s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term
 and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company&#8217;s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate
 the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset also consists of any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives received. The lease terms used to calculate the ROU asset and related lease liability include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
 assessing the risk that a material weakness exists
A company&#39;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#39;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions

The Company has issued non-qualified and incentive stock options to employees and nonemployee directors. The fair value of these options are estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
 which requires estimates of the expected term of the option
 the risk-free interest rate
 the expected volatility of the price of the Company&#8217;s common stock
 and dividend yield. Options outstanding as of December&#160;31
. Due to the Company&#8217;s lack of option exercise history on the date of grant
 the expected term is calculated using the simplified method defined as the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual term of each option. The risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant that most closely corresponds to the expected term of the option. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company&#8217;s common stock over the period of time equivalent to the expected term for each award. The dividend yield is computed as the annualized dividend rate at the grant date divided by the strike price of the stock option. For the years ended December 31

EPS is computed independently for each of the quarters presented; accordingly
There were no disagreements with the Company&#8217;s independent auditors
 regarding accounting and financial disclosures for the fiscal&#160;year ended December&#160;31
In accordance with Exchange Act Rule&#160;13a-15(e)
 we carried out an evaluation
 under the supervision and with the participation of management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule&#160;13a-15(b)&#160;as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation
 our management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December&#160;31
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions
 providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements
 providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of Company assets are made in accordance with management authorization
 and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of Company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or 
detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation
 our management concluded that the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December&#160;31
We rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results. We have completed the implementation of a new global ERP system in the second quarter of 2020
 which replaces our existing operating and financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company&#8217;s financial records
 enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to the Company&#8217;s management team related to the operation of the business. The transition resulted in changes to our internal control over financial reporting as it pertains largely to our application and user access control environments.&#160; We believe these changes
 which generally introduced additional automation
There have been no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules&#160;13a-15(f)&#160;and 15d-15(f)&#160;under the Exchange Act) during the last fiscal quarter ended December 31
 2020 that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
The effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December&#160;31
 2020
 was audited by RSM US LLP
 our independent registered public accounting firm
Our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system
 no matter how well designed and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance that the control system&#8217;s objectives will be met. Further
 the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
 and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
 within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty
 and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons
 by collusion of two or more people
 or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
 and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time
 controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system
 misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

As of December 31

 Medifast
 Inc. has one class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended
 our common stock
References in the following discussion to the &#8220;Company
&#8221; &#8220;we
&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; and similar references mean Medifast
 Inc. excluding
 unless the context otherwise requires or otherwise expressly stated
The following is a summary description of such securities
 and does not purport to be complete.&#160;For a complete description of the terms and provisions of such securities
 refer to our Restated and Amended Certificate of Incorporation (our &#8220;Charter&#8221;) and Amended and Restated Bylaws (our &#8220;Bylaws&#8221;).&#160;&#160;This summary description is qualified in its entirety by reference to these documents
 each of which is included as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this exhibit is a part
Pursuant to our Charter
 the total number of shares of all classes of capital stock which we are authorized to issue is 21
500
000 shares
 consisting of: (i) 20
000
000 shares of common stock and (ii) 1
500
000 shares of preferred stock
 par value $0.001 per share (&#8220;preferred stock&#8221;)
 of which 150
000 shares are designated as Series D Junior Participating Preferred Stock and 150
Holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by our stockholders
 including the election of directors
 and do not have cumulative voting rights.&#160;&#160;Shares representing a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on a matter
 represented in person or by proxy
 will constitute a quorum at all meetings of stockholders. Except as otherwise provided in our Charter
 our Bylaws
 a preferred stock designation or by law
 the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders by the holders of stock entitled to vote thereat will be the act of the stockholders
 provided that
 with respect to the election of directors
 if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected
Subject to the preferences that may be applicable to any then outstanding preferred stock
 the holders of our outstanding shares of common stock are entitled to receive ratably dividends
 if any
Liquidation
In the event of our liquidation
 dissolution or winding up
 holders of our common stock will be entitled to share ratably in the net assets legally available for distribution to stockholders after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities
 subject to the satisfaction of any liquidation preference granted to the holders of any outstanding shares of preferred stock.&#160;&#160;Holders of our common stock have no preemptive
 conversion or subscription rights
 and there is no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to our common stock.&#160;&#160;The rights
 preferences and privileges of the holders of our common stock are subject to
 and may be adversely affected by
Pursuant to our Charter
 our Board has the authority
 without further action by the stockholders to designate and issue up to 1
500
000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series
 to determine or alter the rights
 preferences
 privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued series of preferred stock and the number of shares constituting any such series and the designation thereof
 or any of them; and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series subsequent to the issuance of that series
The DGCL provides that the holders of preferred stock will have the right to vote separately as a class (or
 in some cases
 as a series) on an amendment to our Charter if the amendment would change the par value
 the number of authorized shares of the class or the powers
 preferences or special rights of the class or series so as to adversely affect the class or series
Our Board may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock.&#160;&#160;The issuance of preferred stock
 while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes
 could
 among other things
 have the effect of delaying
 deferring or preventing a change in our control and may adversely affect the market price of the common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock.&#160;&#160;Additionally
We are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL (&#8220;Section 203&#8221;). In general
 Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in &#8220;business combination&#8221; transactions with any &#8220;interested stockholder&#8221; for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder
prior to the time the stockholder became an interested stockholder
upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder
 the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced
at or subsequent to the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder
A &#8220;business combination&#8221; is defined to include
 among other things and in general and subject to exceptions
 a merger of the corporation with the interested stockholder; a sale of 10% or more of the market value of the corporation&#8217;s consolidated assets to the interested stockholder; certain transactions that result in the issuance of the corporation&#8217;s stock to the interested stockholder; a transaction that has the effect of increasing the proportionate share of the corporation&#8217;s stock owned by the interested stockholder; and any receipt by the interested stockholder of loans
 guarantees or other financial benefits provided by the corporation. An &#8220;interested stockholder&#8221; is defined to include
 in general and subject to exceptions
A Delaware corporation may opt out of Section 203 with an express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or by an amendment to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws expressly electing not to be governed by Section 203 and approved by a majority of its outstanding voting shares. We have not opted out of Section 203. As a result
 Section 203 could delay
 deter or prevent a merger
 change of control or other takeover of our company that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests
 including transactions that might result in a premium being paid over the market price of our common stock
Provisions of our Charter and our Bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in our control or change in our management
 including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests.&#160;&#160;Therefore
 these provisions could adversely affect the price of our common stock.&#160;&#160;Among other things
permit our Board to issue up to 1
500
000 shares of preferred stock
 with any rights
provide that any vacancies resulting from death
 resignation
 retirement
 disqualification
 removal from office or other cause
 as well as newly created directorships
 may
 except as otherwise required by law and subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock
 be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office
 even if less than a quorum
 or by a sole remaining director
provide that no action taken by our stockholders by written consent will be effective until independent inspectors engaged by the Company for the purpose of performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations have completed their review
 determined that the requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents delivered to the Company in accordance with our Bylaws and applicable law have been obtained to authorize or take the action specified in the consents
provide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of stockholders must provide notice in writing in a timely manner
 and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder&#8217;s notice; do not provide for cumulative voting rights (therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election
 if they should so choose); and provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by (1) our Chairman of the Board
 our President or our Secretary when directed to do so by resolution of the Board
Any of these provisions may be amended by a majority of our Board
 subject to certain limitations as set forth in our Charter
 Bylaws and any certificate of designation.

The cash and cash equivalents generally are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit
 and therefore bear minimal credit risk. Historically
 we have not experienced any losses due to such concentration of credit risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;&gt;&lt;b style=font-weight:bold;&gt;Fair Value of Financial Instruments&lt;/b&gt;&#160;- Our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents
 investment in available-for-sale securities
 and trade receivables. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The fair value of investments in available-for-sale securities are based on third-party pricing services provided by the Company&#x2019;s investment advisory firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;&gt;&lt;b style=font-weight:bold;&gt;Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts&lt;/b&gt;&#160;- Accounts receivable are recorded net of provisions for doubtful accounts. We estimate losses on account receivable based on expected losses
 including our historical experience of actual losses. Accounts receivable is considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts as of December&#160;31
 2020 and 2019 was $0.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;&gt;&lt;b style=font-weight:bold;&gt;Inventories&lt;/b&gt;&#160;- Inventories consist principally of raw materials and packaged meal replacements held in the Company&#x2019;s warehouses and outsourced distribution centers. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value
 utilizing the first-in
 first-out method. The cost of finished goods includes the cost of raw materials

Available-for-sale debt securities are stated at fair value and unrealized holding gains and losses
 net of the related deferred tax effect
 are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders&#x2019; equity. Interest and dividends on marketable debt securities are recognized in income when declared. Realized gains and losses

 allocated consideration to loyalty programs

 in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for transferring those products.  When determining whether the customer has obtained control of the products
 we consider any future performance obligations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;&gt;A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer
 and is the unit of account in &lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;ASC 606
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers&lt;/i&gt;. A contract&#x2019;s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when
 or as
 each performance obligation is satisfied. Our contracts have performance obligations to fulfill and deliver products from the point of sale transaction along with the related customer reward programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;&gt;&lt;span style=white-space:pre-wrap;&gt;Our performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time. Revenue from products transferred to clients at a point in time accounted for substantially all of our revenue for the years ended December 31
 2020
 2019 and 2018. Revenue on these contracts is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract with our customer are satisfied.  Generally

 such as customer reward programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements and promotions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;&gt;We reduce the transaction price for certain customer reward programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements
 promotions
 and incentives that represent variable consideration and separate performance obligations. The Company accounts for sales rewards that provide the customer with a material right as a separate performance obligation of the transactions

 general and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;&gt;&lt;b style=font-weight:bold;&gt;Leases&lt;/b&gt;&#160;- The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and categorizes leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. All the Company&#x2019;s leases are operating leases. The right-of-use (&#x201c;ROU&#x201d;) assets represent the Company&#x2019;s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term
 and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company&#x2019;s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate
 the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset also consists of any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives received. The lease terms used to calculate the ROU asset and related lease liability include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt;&gt;&lt;b style=font-weight:bold;&gt;Advertising Costs&lt;/b&gt;&#160;- Advertising costs are expensed as incurred
 except for the preparation
 layout
 design and production of advertising costs which are expensed when the advertisement is first used. They are recorded in selling
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;&gt;general
 and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Advertising expense
 excluding broker fees
 for the&#160;years ended December&#160;31
 2020
 2019 and 2018
 amounted to $4.4 million
 $5.3 million and $6.0 million
 respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;&gt;&lt;b style=font-weight:bold;&gt;Research and Development&lt;/b&gt;&#160;- The Company incurs research and development costs in connection with the development of new products and programs
 which are expensed as incurred. They are recorded in selling
 general
 and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company incurred $2.8 million
 $2.7 million and $2.2 million in research and development expense for the&#160;years ended December&#160;31
 2020
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;&gt;&lt;b style=font-weight:bold;&gt;Share-Based Compensation&lt;/b&gt;&#160;- Share-based compensation consists primarily of restricted stock awards
 market and performance-based share awards
 and stock options granted to employees and directors. Restricted stock awards are measured at the grant date
 based on the calculated fair value of the award
 and are recognized as an expense over the requisite service period. The fair value of the incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model as of the grant date and recognized over the service period. Market and performance-based share awards that are tied to the Company&#x2019;s total stockholder return and stock price are valued using the Monte Carlo method and are recognized as expense over the award&#x2019;s achievement period. The Company issues new shares upon the exercise of stock options and the granting of restricted stock awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;&gt;&lt;b style=font-weight:bold;&gt;Income Taxes&lt;/b&gt;&#160;- Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when
 in the opinion of management
 it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;&gt;The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period during which
 based on all available evidence
 management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination
 including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes
 if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;&gt;We evaluated our tax positions and determined that we did not have any material uncertain tax positions. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense. For the&#160;years ended December&#160;31
 2020
 2019 and 2018
 no material estimated interest or penalties were recognized for the uncertainty of certain tax positions. We file income tax returns in the United States and various states and foreign jurisdictions. We are generally no longer subject to United States federal

&#160;&lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes

 the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences related to changes in ownership of equity method investments and foreign subsidiaries. The standard also simplifies aspects of accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill and allocating consolidated income taxes to separate financial statements of entities not subject to income tax. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15

 management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination

Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.

 the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences related to changes in ownership of equity method investments and foreign subsidiaries. The standard also simplifies aspects of accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill and allocating consolidated income taxes to separate financial statements of entities not subject to income tax. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15

 which requires estimates of the expected term of the option
 the risk-free interest rate
 the expected volatility of the price of the Company&#x2019;s common stock
 and dividend yield. Options outstanding as of December&#160;31
 2020 generally vest over a period of three years and expire ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price of these options ranges from $26.52 to $171.68. Due to the Company&#x2019;s lack of option exercise history on the date of grant
 the expected term is calculated using the simplified method defined as the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual term of each option. The risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant that most closely corresponds to the expected term of the option. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company&#x2019;s common stock over the period of time equivalent to the expected term for each award. The dividend yield is computed as the annualized dividend rate at the grant date divided by the strike price of the stock option. For the years ended December 31
 2020 and 2019
 the Company did not grant stock options. The weighted average input assumptions used for the&#160;year ended December&#160;31


 2020
 the weighted-average remaining contractual life was 5.7 years with an aggregate intrinsic value of $9.2 million for outstanding stock options and the weighted-average remaining contractual life was 5.2&#160;years with an aggregate intrinsic value of $6.9 million for exercisable options. The unrecognized compensation expense calculated under the fair value method for shares expected to vest as of December&#160;31
 2020 was $0.2 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.1&#160;years. The Company received $1.6 million
 $0.3 million and $0.5 million in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options during the&#160;years ended December&#160;31

&#160;- Share-based compensation consists primarily of restricted stock awards
 market and performance-based share awards
 and stock options granted to employees and directors. Restricted stock awards are measured at the grant date
 based on the calculated fair value of the award
&#160;- Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when
 in the opinion of management
The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period during which
 based on all available evidence
 management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination
 including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes
We evaluated our tax positions and determined that we did not have any material uncertain tax positions. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense. For the&#160;years ended December&#160;31
 2020
 2019 and 2018
 no material estimated interest or penalties were recognized for the uncertainty of certain tax positions. We file income tax returns in the United States and various states and foreign jurisdictions. We are generally no longer subject to United States federal
&#160;- Other comprehensive income refers to revenues
 expenses
 and gains and losses that are not included in net income but rather are recorded directly in stockholders&#8217; equity. Comprehensive income consists of net income
 unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities
In August 2018
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2018-15

On January 1
 2020
 the Company adopted ASU 2018-15. The Company capitalized&#160;$2.9&#160;million in total for the year ended December 31
 2020
 principally related to the configuration and development of the Company&#8217;s new hosted enterprise resource planning tool (&#8220;ERP&#8221;). The amortization expense associated with the capitalized costs was&#160;$0.2&#160;million for the year ended December 31
In June 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-13
&#160;
 which institutes a new model for recognizing credit losses on financial instruments that are not measured at fair value. On January 1
 2020
We have considered all new accounting pronouncements and have concluded that there are no new pronouncements that have the potential for a material impact on our results of operations
 financial condition
 or cash flows
 based on current information
In December 2019
 the FASB issued ASU 2019-12

&#160;
 the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences related to changes in ownership of equity method investments and foreign subsidiaries. The standard also simplifies aspects of accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill and allocating consolidated income taxes to separate financial statements of entities not subject to income tax. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2020
 with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption
 the Company must apply certain aspects of this standard retrospectively for all periods presented while other aspects are applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. Management has determined the effect that the provisions of ASU 2019-12 will have on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements is immaterial.&#160;

The Company has issued non-qualified and incentive stock options to employees and nonemployee directors. The fair value of these options are estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
 which requires estimates of the expected term of the option
 the risk-free interest rate
 the expected volatility of the price of the Company&#8217;s common stock
 and dividend yield. Options outstanding as of December&#160;31
 2020 generally vest over a period of three years and expire ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price of these options ranges from $26.52 to $171.68. Due to the Company&#8217;s lack of option exercise history on the date of grant
 the expected term is calculated using the simplified method defined as the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual term of each option. The risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant that most closely corresponds to the expected term of the option. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company&#8217;s common stock over the period of time equivalent to the expected term for each award. The dividend yield is computed as the annualized dividend rate at the grant date divided by the strike price of the stock option. For the years ended December 31
 2020 and 2019
 the Company did not grant stock options. The weighted average input assumptions used for the&#160;year ended December&#160;31
The number of stock options and weighted-average exercise prices as of December&#160;31
As of December&#160;31
 2020
 the weighted-average remaining contractual life was 5.7 years with an aggregate intrinsic value of $9.2 million for outstanding stock options and the weighted-average remaining contractual life was 5.2&#160;years with an aggregate intrinsic value of $6.9 million for exercisable options. The unrecognized compensation expense calculated under the fair value method for shares expected to vest as of December&#160;31
 2020 was $0.2 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.1&#160;years. The Company received $1.6 million
 $0.3 million and $0.5 million in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options during the&#160;years ended December&#160;31
 2020
 2019 and 2018
 respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the&#160;years ended December&#160;31
 2020
 2019 and 2018 was $1.5 million
 $1.0 million and $4.1 million
 after the date of grant.  The fair value of the restricted stock is equal to the market price of the Company&#8217;s common stock on the date of grant. Expense for restricted stock is amortized ratably over the vesting period.  A summary of outstanding restricted stock activity as of December&#160;31
The Company withheld&#160;0.0&#160;million

&#160;- Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit in financial institutions
 institutional money funds and other short-term investments with a maturity of 90&#160;days or less at the time of purchase.




&#160;- Our cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities are maintained at several financial institutions and the balances with these financial institutions often exceed the amount of insurance provided on such accounts by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The cash and cash equivalents generally are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit
 and therefore bear minimal credit risk. Historically
 we have not experienced any losses due to such concentration of credit risk.




&#160;- Our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents
 investment in available-for-sale securities
 and trade receivables. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The fair value of investments in available-for-sale securities are based on third-party pricing services provided by the Company&#8217;s investment advisory firm.




&#160;- Accounts receivable are recorded net of provisions for doubtful accounts. We estimate losses on account receivable based on expected losses
 including our historical experience of actual losses. Accounts receivable is considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts as of December&#160;31
 2020 and 2019 was $0.2 million.




&#160;- Inventories consist principally of raw materials and packaged meal replacements held in the Company&#8217;s warehouses and outsourced distribution centers. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value
 utilizing the first-in
 first-out method. The cost of finished goods includes the cost of raw materials
 packaging supplies
 direct and indirect labor
 and other indirect manufacturing costs. On a quarterly basis
 management reviews inventories for unsalable or obsolete inventories.




&#160;- The Company&#8217;s investments consist of debt securities classified as available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale debt securities are stated at fair value and unrealized holding gains and losses
 net of the related deferred tax effect
 are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders&#8217; equity. Interest and dividends on marketable debt securities are recognized in income when declared. Realized gains and losses
 if any
 are included in income.



Property
 Plant
 and Equipment
Property
 Plant
 and Equipment
 plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Company computes depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets acquired as follows:




&#160;- Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows
 an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.




- Our revenue is derived primarily from point of sale transactions executed over an ecommerce platform for weight loss
 weight management
 and other consumable health and nutritional products.  Revenue is recognized upon receipt by customer and net of discounts
 rebates
 promotional adjustments
 price adjustments
 allocated consideration to loyalty programs
Revenue is recognized when control of the promised products is transferred to our clients
 in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for transferring those products.  When determining whether the customer has obtained control of the products
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer

 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 or as
Our performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time. Revenue from products transferred to clients at a point in time accounted for substantially all of our revenue for the years ended December 31
 2020
 2019 and 2018. Revenue on these contracts is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract with our customer are satisfied.  Generally
Our sales contracts may give clients the option to purchase additional products priced at a discount.  Options to acquire additional products at a discount can come in many forms
We reduce the transaction price for certain customer reward programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements
 promotions
 and incentives that represent variable consideration and separate performance obligations. The Company accounts for sales rewards that provide the customer with a material right as a separate performance obligation of the transactions
We expense sales commissions and credit card fees during the period in which the corresponding revenue is earned.  These costs are deferred along with the revenues for goods that are in transit and not received by clients by period end.  These costs are recorded in selling
 general and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.




&#160;- The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and categorizes leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. All the Company&#8217;s leases are operating leases. The right-of-use (&#8220;ROU&#8221;) assets represent the Company&#8217;s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term
 and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company&#8217;s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate
 the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset also consists of any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives received. The lease terms used to calculate the ROU asset and related lease liability include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense. 




&#160;- Advertising costs are expensed as incurred
 except for the preparation
 layout
 design and production of advertising costs which are expensed when the advertisement is first used. They are recorded in selling
general
 and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Advertising expense
 excluding broker fees
 for the&#160;years ended December&#160;31
 2020
 2019 and 2018
 amounted to $4.4 million
 $5.3 million and $6.0 million
 respectively. 




&#160;- The Company incurs research and development costs in connection with the development of new products and programs
 which are expensed as incurred. They are recorded in selling
 general
 and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company incurred $2.8 million
 $2.7 million and $2.2 million in research and development expense for the&#160;years ended December&#160;31
 2020
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.




&#160;- Share-based compensation consists primarily of restricted stock awards
 market and performance-based share awards
 and stock options granted to employees and directors. Restricted stock awards are measured at the grant date
 based on the calculated fair value of the award
 and are recognized as an expense over the requisite service period. The fair value of the incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model as of the grant date and recognized over the service period. Market and performance-based share awards that are tied to the Company&#8217;s total stockholder return and stock price are valued using the Monte Carlo method and are recognized as expense over the award&#8217;s achievement period. The Company issues new shares upon the exercise of stock options and the granting of restricted stock awards.




&#160;- Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when
 in the opinion of management
The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period during which
 based on all available evidence
 management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination
 including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes
We evaluated our tax positions and determined that we did not have any material uncertain tax positions. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense. For the&#160;years ended December&#160;31
 2020
 2019 and 2018
 no material estimated interest or penalties were recognized for the uncertainty of certain tax positions. We file income tax returns in the United States and various states and foreign jurisdictions. We are generally no longer subject to United States federal
 state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for the&#160;years before 2017.









&#160;- Other comprehensive income refers to revenues
 expenses
 and gains and losses that are not included in net income but rather are recorded directly in stockholders&#8217; equity. Comprehensive income consists of net income
 unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities
 and foreign currency translation adjustments.




In August 2018
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2018-15

On January 1
 2020
 the Company adopted ASU 2018-15. The Company capitalized&#160;$2.9&#160;million in total for the year ended December 31
 2020
 principally related to the configuration and development of the Company&#8217;s new hosted enterprise resource planning tool (&#8220;ERP&#8221;). The amortization expense associated with the capitalized costs was&#160;$0.2&#160;million for the year ended December 31
In June 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-13
&#160;
 which institutes a new model for recognizing credit losses on financial instruments that are not measured at fair value. On January 1
 2020
We have considered all new accounting pronouncements and have concluded that there are no new pronouncements that have the potential for a material impact on our results of operations
 financial condition
 or cash flows
 based on current information
In December 2019
 the FASB issued ASU 2019-12

&#160;
 the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences related to changes in ownership of equity method investments and foreign subsidiaries. The standard also simplifies aspects of accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill and allocating consolidated income taxes to separate financial statements of entities not subject to income tax. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2020
 with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption
 the Company must apply certain aspects of this standard retrospectively for all periods presented while other aspects are applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. Management has determined the effect that the provisions of ASU 2019-12 will have on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements is immaterial.&#160;

The estimated measure of the percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.
