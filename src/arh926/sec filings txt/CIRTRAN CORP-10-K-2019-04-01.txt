PART
I

ITEM
1. BUSINESS



From
2007 until October 2016
 we manufactured
 marketed
 and distributed internationally an energy drink under a license with Playboy
through our subsidiary
 CirTran Beverage Corporation (&ldquo;CirTran Beverage&rdquo;). CirTran Beverage conducted its activities
under an agreement with Play Beverages
 LLC (&ldquo;PlayBev&rdquo;)
 which held the Playboy license. During this time
 PlayBev
was considered a variable interest entity. On October 21
 2016
 we deconsolidated PlayBev from our consolidated financial statements.

In
October 2016
 Playboy obtained a judgment against CirTran Beverage and PlayBev holding that the license is no longer valid
 that
PlayBev is no longer authorized to market the Playboy-branded energy drink
 and awarding money damages to Playboy. CirTran Corporation
was not a party to the lawsuit. CirTran Beverage and PlayBev filed a motion for a retrial
 which was denied by the court in October
2018. 

After
the Playboy litigation was initiated
 our activities declined
rapidly
 as management sought to obtain the forbearance of our principal secured and judgment creditors
 seeking
to resolve disputes respecting the PlayBev license to market Playboy-licensed energy drinks
 defending the numerous lawsuits to
which we were a party
 and obtaining additional capital. Disputes respecting the status of the PlayBev license to market Playboy-licensed
energy drinks impaired our ability to establish new distributors
 damaged some of our relationships with existing distributors
and considerably depressed revenues.

We
are now without significant operations. Reflecting our severely limited operations
 we had minimal revenue of $12
500 during the
year ended December 31
 2017
 and $0 during the year ended December 31
 2018.

References
to &ldquo;us
&rdquo; &ldquo;we
&rdquo; &ldquo;our
&rdquo; and correlative terms refer to CirTran Corporation and the subsidiaries
and divisions through which we conduct our activities.

Consumer
Product Commercialization&mdash;Contract Marketing

We
are now seeking to commercialize one or more consumer products. Through these efforts
 we will identify what we believe
to be a product or other demand and then seek a product that may be distributed to address that demand. We pursue contract marketing
relationships principally in the domestic consumer products markets
 including products in areas such as home and garden
 kitchen
health and beauty
 toys
 licensed merchandise
 and apparel for film
 television
 sports
 and other entertainment properties. If
we deem it suitable
 we may obtain rights from the product owner to manufacture and market a particular product
 generally in
consideration of the payment of a royalty
 sometimes accompanied with an initial fee. Frequently
 owners of undeveloped products
or product concepts are seeking branding
 marketing
 manufacturing
 order fulfillment
 and distribution assistance. Where we identify
a need but find no suitable available product
 we may design our own product for commercialization.

Our
commercialization effort includes developing product packaging
 branding the product
 arranging third-party manufacturing
 establishing
distribution channels
 and arranging order fulfillment. We anticipate that these activities will generally be undertaken by third
parties under contract. In some cases
 we may brand a product under a license to use a third-party&rsquo;s recognized name
 as
we did in the case of the Playboy-branded energy drink
 seek an endorsement from a publicly recognized celebrity
 sports figure
or other person
 or obtain the rights to use the image
 likeness
 or logo of a product or a person
 such as a well-known celebrity.
Licensed merchandise and apparel are then sold and marketed in the entertainment and sports franchise industries. We anticipate
that these products will be introduced into the market under either one uniform brand name or separate trademarked names that
we originate and own or acquire by license.

Although
we are now investigating some commercialization opportunities
 we are in the early stages of our efforts and cannot assure that
we will be successful in completing commercialization of any product
 generating revenues
 or realizing a profit.

The
contract-manufacturing industry specializes in providing the program management
 technical and administrative support
 and manufacturing
expertise required to take products from the early design and prototype stages through volume production and distribution
 providing
the customer with a quality product
 delivered on time and at a competitive cost. This full range of services gives the customer
an opportunity to avoid large capital investments in plant
 inventory
 equipment
 and staffing
 so that instead
 it can concentrate
on innovation
 design
 and marketing. By using our contract-manufacturing services
 customers will have the ability to improve
the return on their investment with greater flexibility in responding to market demands and exploiting new market opportunities.
Our efforts will be led by our current chief executive officer and others that we may hire as employees or engage as independent
contractors.

In
previous years
 we found that customers increasingly required contract manufacturers to provide complete turn-key manufacturing
and material handling services
 rather than working on a consignment basis in which the customer supplies all materials and the
contract manufacturer supplies only labor. Turn-key contracts involve design
 manufacturing and engineering support
 procurement
of all materials
 and sophisticated in-circuit and functional testing and distribution. The manufacturing partnership between
customers and contract manufacturers involves an increased use of &ldquo;just-in-time&rdquo; inventory management techniques that
minimize the customer&rsquo;s investment in component inventories
 personnel
 and related facilities
 thereby reducing its costs.


    
    


Based
on the trends we have observed in the contract-manufacturing industry
 we believe we will benefit from the increased market acceptance
of
 and reliance upon
 the use of manufacturing specialists by many original equipment manufacturers
 or OEMs
 marketing firms
distributors
 and national retailers. We believe the trend towards outsourcing manufacturing will continue. OEMs use manufacturing
specialists for many reasons
 including reducing the time it takes to bring new products to market
 reducing the initial investment
required
 accessing leading manufacturing technology
 gaining the ability to better focus resources in other value-added areas
and improving inventory management and purchasing power. An important element of our strategy is to establish partnerships with
major and emerging OEM leaders in diverse segments across our target industries. Due to the costs inherent in supporting customer
relationships
 we focus on customers with which the opportunity exists to develop long-term business partnerships. Our goal is
to provide our customers with total manufacturing solutions through third-party providers for both new and more mature products
as well as across product generations&mdash;an idea we call &ldquo;Concept to Consumer.&rdquo;

We
have also designed
 engineered
 manufactured
 and supplied products in the international electronics
 consumer products
 and general
merchandise industries for various marketers
 distributors
 and retailers selling overseas. We have provided manufacturing services
to the direct-response and retail consumer markets. Our experience and expertise enables us to enter a project at various phases:
engineering and design; product development and prototyping; tooling; and high-volume manufacturing. Our contacts with Asian suppliers
have helped us to maintain our status as an international contract manufacturer for multiple products in a wide variety of industries
which will allow us to target larger-scale contracts.

We
intend to pursue manufacturing relationships beyond printed circuit board assemblies
 cables
 harnesses
 and injection-molding
systems by establishing complete &ldquo;box-build&rdquo; or &ldquo;turn-key&rdquo; relationships in the electronics
 retail
 and
direct consumer markets.


We
have developed markets for several fitness and exercise products
 household and kitchen products and appliances
 and health and
beauty aids that are manufactured in China. We anticipate that offshore contract manufacturing will play an increased role moving
forward as resources become available to us.


Beverage
Distribution


We
are no longer authorized to manufacture or market the Playboy-branded energy drink but we may seek to rebrand and remarket an
energy drink based on our own brand and product formula
 relying at least in part on the beverage distribution network
that we previously developed.&nbsp;

Sales
and Marketing

We
review opportunities to identify products that we may market through current sales channels. We also seek new paths to
deliver products and services directly to end users and are pursuing strategic and reciprocal relationships with retail distribution
firms whereby they would act as our retail distribution arm and we would act as their manufacturing arm
 with each party giving
the other priority and first opportunity to work on the other&rsquo;s products.

Our
contacts in China may allow us to increase our manufacturing capacity and output with minimal capital investment required. By
using various subcontractors
 we may leverage our upfront payments for inventories and tooling to control costs and receive
benefits from economies of scale in Asian manufacturing facilities.

Typically
and depending on the contract
 we may be required to prepay a portion of the purchase orders for materials. In exchange for financial
commitments
 we may receive dedicated manufacturing responsiveness and eliminate the costly expense associated with capitalizing
completely proprietary facilities. For example
 we previously expanded our manufacturing capabilities for our beverage division
outside the United States to accommodate international customers by contracting with manufacturers in Hungary and India.

During
a typical contract manufacturing sales process
 a customer provides us with specifications for the product it wants
 and we develop
a bid price for manufacturing a minimum quantity that includes manufacture engineering
 parts
 labor
 testing
 and shipping. If
the bid is accepted
 the customer is required to purchase the minimum quantity
 and additional product is sold through purchase
orders issued under the original contract. Special engineering services are provided at either an hourly rate or a fixed contract
price for a specified task.


    
    




Competition
in our targeted markets is comprised of manufacturing technology
 merchandise quality
 responsiveness
 the provision of value-added
services
 and price. To be competitive
 we must provide technologically advanced manufacturing services
 maintain quality levels
offer flexible delivery schedules
 and deliver finished products on a reliable basis and for a favorable price.

The
manufacturing services industry is large and diverse and serviced by many companies
 including several that have achieved significant
market share. We will compete with different companies depending on the type of service or geographic area. Certain of our competitors
may have greater manufacturing
 financial
 research and development
 and marketing resources than we have.

We
will also face competition from current and prospective customers that evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing
products internally.



We
are subject to typical federal
 state
 and local regulations and laws governing the operations of manufacturing concerns
 including
environmental disposal
 storage
 and discharge regulations and laws; employee safety laws and regulations; and labor practices
laws and regulations. We are not required under current laws and regulations to obtain or maintain any specialized or agency-specific
licenses
 permits
 or authorizations to conduct our manufacturing services. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all
relevant regulations applicable to our business and operations. All international sales permits are the responsibility of the
local distributors
 and they are required to obtain all local licenses and permits.



At
December 31
 2018
 we had three part-time employees
 including our chief executive officer.

Corporate
Background and History

In
1987
 CirTran Corporation was incorporated in Nevada under the name Vermillion Ventures
 Inc.
 for the purpose of acquiring other
operating corporate entities. We were largely inactive until July 1
 2000
 when we acquired substantially all of the assets and
certain liabilities of Circuit Technology
 Inc.
 through a wholly owned subsidiary
 CirTran Corporation (Utah)
 that we created
for the purpose of completing the acquisition.&nbsp;

Our
predecessor business in Circuit Technology
 Inc. was commenced in 1993 by our president
 Iehab Hawatmeh. In 2001
 we effected
a 15-for-1 forward-split of our shares and a stock distribution
 which increased the number of our issued and outstanding shares
of common stock. We also increased our authorized capital from 500
000
000 to 750
000
000 shares. In 2007
 our stockholders approved
a 1.2-for-1 forward-split of our shares and an amendment to our articles of incorporation that increased our authorized capital
to 1
500
000
000 shares of common stock. In August 2011
 we increased our authorized capitalization to 4
500
000
000 shares of
common stock
 par value $0.001.

In
May 2015
 our stockholders and board of directors approved an amendment to our articles of incorporation to complete a 1
000-to-1
reverse split
 or consolidation
 of our common stock
 decrease our authorized common stock to 100
000
000 shares
 par value
$0.001
 and authorize a class of 5
000
000 shares of preferred stock having such terms as the board of directors may determine
prior to issuance (the &ldquo;Amendment&rdquo;). However
 FINRA refused to approve the Amendment until such time as we became
current in our periodic reports and received approval for our common stock to resume trading. While we have become current in
our periodic reports
 we are continuing to work with FINRA to allow trading of our common stock.


    
    


ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS


In
addition to the negative implications of all information and financial data included in or referred to directly in this report
you should consider the following risk factors. This report contains forward-looking statements and information concerning us
our plans
 and other future events. Those statements should be read together with the discussion of risk factors set forth below
because those risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.

We
may be deemed to be insolvent and may face liquidation.

We
may be deemed to be insolvent. We are unable to meet all of our obligations as they accrue
 and the aggregate amount of our liabilities
exceeds the value of our assets. Creditors may have the right to initiate involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against us
to seek our liquidation. We cannot assure that we would be successful in avoiding liquidation by converting such liquidation
proceedings to a Chapter 11 reorganization
 which would permit us to develop and propose
 for creditor and court approval
a reorganization plan that would enable us to proceed. Even if we were to propose a reorganization plan
 any reorganization plan
would likely require that we obtain new post-petition funding
 which may be unavailable. Further
 in the event of bankruptcy
our secured creditors that have encumbrances on all of our assets would likely execute and take all of our assets
 which may leave
nothing for other creditors or our stockholders.

The
auditors&rsquo; report for our most recent fiscal year
 like previous years
 contains an explanatory paragraph about our ability
to continue as a going concern.

We
had a net loss of $1.1 million during the year ended December 31
 2018
 and $2.0 million during the year ended December 31
 2017
which includes $0.2 million and $0.3 million in losses from discontinued operations. We had an accumulated deficit of $77.7 million
as of December 31
 2018. During the year ended December 31
 2018
 net cash used in operations was $0.2 million. We had current
liabilities of $36.7 million and a $36.7 million working capital deficit as of December 31
 2018. The reports from our auditors
on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 as for several previous years
 contain
explanatory paragraphs about our ability to continue as a going concern.

We
may not be able to establish new operations based on the commercialization of new products or concepts.

Following
the judicial termination of our rights to distribute a Playboy-branded energy drink and in the absence of a successful motion
for a new trial and a favorable decision in a new trial in 2018
 we are seeking to establish new operations based on the
commercialization of new products or product concepts. We cannot assure that we will be able to identify
 acquire
 or originate
new products
 complete branding
 arrange third-party manufacturing
 establish order fulfillment relationships
 or establish distribution
channels in order to generate new revenues.

All
of our assets are encumbered to secure the payment of approximately $2.6 million of indebtedness
 plus $1.3 million of accrued
interest
 on secured convertible debentures that require payments if not previously converted to common stock.


We
have encumbered all of our assets to secure the payment of approximately $2.6 million in indebtedness
 plus $1.3 million of accrued
interest
 due on secured convertible debentures
 of which $0.2 million was required to be repaid by October 2018 and $2.4 million
is required to be repaid by April 2027
 if not previously converted. Because we are in default in payment
 our secured creditor
could exercise its remedies
 including the execution on all of our assets
 which would result in the termination of our activities.
We cannot assure that the secured creditor will continue to refrain from aggressive collection efforts. The existence of these
secured obligations will likely significantly impair our ability to obtain capital from external sources.



We
are a party to numerous lawsuits that require significant management attention and funds for attorney&rsquo;s fees and
subject us to risks of damages or other adverse judgments.

We
are a party to numerous lawsuits
 some of which remain active
requiring that we incur attorney&rsquo;s fees and other costs and devote management&rsquo;s time and attention. Successful suits
by creditors for the collection of debts may require that we pay judgment amounts
 subject to the priority encumbrances in favor
of secured creditors. We may incur significant costs to pursue litigation in which we are the plaintiff without any recovery or
other favorable outcome. Any judgments we may obtain against third parties may not be collectible.


    
    


We
will require substantial amounts of additional capital from external sources.

We
may seek required funds through the sale of equity or other securities. Our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms will
depend on many factors
 including the condition of the securities markets generally and for companies like us at the time of the
offering; our business
 financial condition
 and prospects at the time of the proposed offering; our ability to identify and reach
a satisfactory arrangement with prospective securities sales and investment groups; and various other factors. We cannot assure
that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us or at all. The issuance of additional equity securities may
dilute the interest of our existing stockholders or may subordinate their rights to the superior rights of new investors.

We
may also seek additional capital through strategic alliances
 joint ventures
 or other collaborative arrangements. Any such relationships
may dilute our interest in any specific project and decrease the amount of revenue that we may receive from the project. We cannot
assure that we will be able to negotiate any strategic investment or obtain required additional funds on acceptable terms
 if
at all. In addition
 our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of the results of future marketing
and manufacturing agreements; results of product testing; potential relationships with our strategic or collaborative partners;
changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs; competition and technological advances; issues related
to patent or other protection for proprietary technologies; and other factors.

If
adequate funds are not available
 we may be required to delay
 reduce the scope of
 or eliminate our planned efforts; obtain funds
through arrangements with strategic or collaborative partners that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies
product candidates
 or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves; or sublicense our rights to
such products on terms that are less favorable to us than might otherwise be available.

Any
substantial increase in business activities will require skilled management of growth.

If
we have the opportunity to commercialize new products
 our success will depend on our ability to manage continued growth
 including
integrating new employees and independent contractors into an effective management and technical team; formulating strategic alliances
joint ventures
 or other collaborative arrangements with third parties; commercializing and marketing proposed products and services;
and monitoring and managing these relationships on a long-term basis. If our management is unable to integrate these resources
and manage growth effectively
 the quality of our products and services
 our ability to retain key personnel
 and the results
of our operations would be materially and adversely affected.


Our
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December&nbsp;31
 2018. Compliance
with public company regulatory requirements
 including those relating to our internal control over financial reporting
 have and
will likely continue to result in significant expenses and
 if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting in the future
 investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market
price of our common stock may be negatively affected.

As
a public reporting company
 we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as well as to the information and reporting requirements
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended
 and other federal securities laws. As a result
 we incur significant legal
accounting
 and other expenses
 including costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and corporate governance
requirements. As an example of public reporting company requirements
 we evaluate the effectiveness of disclosure controls and
procedures and of our internal control over financing reporting in order to allow management to report on such controls.

Our
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31
 2018
 due to a failure
to maintain an effective control environment
 failure of segregation of duties
 failure of entity-level controls
 and our sole
executive&rsquo;s access to cash.

If
significant deficiencies or other material weaknesses are identified in our internal control over financial reporting that we
cannot remediate in a timely manner
 investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.
This would likely have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock and our ability to secure any necessary additional
equity or debt financing.


We
have issued nearly all of the shares of stock we are authorized to issue
 which may limit our ability to obtain necessary financing.

We
have authorized 4
500
000
000 shares of common stock
 nearly all of which has been issued. Being unable to issue additional shares
of common stock limits our ability to obtain the financing we need. Although our stockholders voted to decrease the number of
shares issued and outstanding via a 1 for 1
000 reverse stock split
 we are unable to proceed with recapitalization because we
could not obtain necessary approval from FINRA. We cannot assure that completing the registration of our common stock under the
Securities Exchange Act or replacing the holder of our secured convertible debentures will enable us to obtain FINRA approval
for our Amendment in order to increase our capitalization.

We
do not have enough authorized shares available to allow the conversion and exercise of outstanding convertible debentures and
options
 which may subject us to liability.

We
have approximately $2.6 million in principal
 plus $1.3 million of accrued interest
 for outstanding convertible debentures. We
do not have adequate authorized and unissued shares of common stock to permit the conversion and exercise of those securities.
If those holders of our convertible debentures and options attempted to convert and exercise those securities
 they would be unable
to do so
 which might place us in default of our obligation to increase our capitalization.


    
    


Penny
stock regulations will impose certain restrictions on resales of our securities
 which may cause an investor to lose some or all
of its investment.

The
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations that generally define a &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; to be any equity
security that has a market price (as defined) of less than $5.00 per share that is not traded on a national securities exchange
or that has an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share
 subject to certain exceptions. As a result
 our common stock is subject
to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell these securities to persons other than
established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of $1
000
000 or annual income exceeding
$200
000
 or $300
000 together with their spouse). For transactions covered by these rules
 the broker-dealer must make a special
suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and have received the purchaser&rsquo;s written consent to the transaction
before the purchase. Further
 if the price of the stock is below $5.00 per share and the issuer does not have $2.0 million or
more net tangible assets or is not listed on a registered national securities exchange
 sales of that stock in the secondary trading
market are subject to certain additional rules promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These rules generally
require
 among other things
 that brokers engaged in secondary trading of penny stocks provide customers with written disclosure
documents
 monthly statements of the market value of penny stocks
 disclosure of the bid and asked prices
 and disclosure of the
compensation to the broker-dealer and the salesperson working for the broker-dealer in connection with the transaction. These
rules and regulations may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock
 thereby effectively limiting the liquidity
of our common stock. These rules may also adversely affect the ability of persons that acquire our common stock to resell their
securities in any trading market that may exist at the time of such intended sale.

We
are an &ldquo;emerging growth company
&rdquo; and any decision on our part to comply with certain reduced disclosure requirements
applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.

We
are an &ldquo;emerging growth company
&rdquo; as defined in the JOBS Act and
 for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth
company
 we may choose to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public
companies
 including: not being required to have our internal control over financial reporting audited by our independent registered
public accounting firm pursuant to Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive
compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and exemptions from the requirements to hold a nonbinding advisory
vote on executive compensation and to obtain stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We
may take advantage of these provisions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an &ldquo;emerging growth
company.&rdquo; We will remain an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; for up to five years
 although
 we would cease to be an
&ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; upon the earliest of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion
of a public offering of its securities;&nbsp;the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenue is $1&nbsp;billion or more;
the date on which we have
 during the previous three-year period
 issued more than $1&nbsp;billion in non-convertible debt securities;
or the date on which we are deemed to be a &ldquo;large accelerated filer&rdquo; as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of
1934
 or the Exchange Act. To the extent we take advantage of any of these reduced reporting burdens in this prospectus or in
future filings
 the information that we provide our security holders may be different than you might get from other public companies
in which you hold equity interests. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely
on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result
 there may be a less active trading market
for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.

Under
Section&nbsp;107(b) of the JOBS Act
 emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such
time as those standards apply to private companies. We are choosing to &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; of such extended transition period
however
 and
 as a result
 we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of
such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section&nbsp;107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt
out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.

2. PROPERTIES

We
rent on a month-to-month basis our existing approximately 40
000-square-foot headquarters and manufacturing facility
 located
at 4125 South 6000 West in West Valley City
 Utah. Monthly payments are $3
500. The premises include about 10
000 square feet
of office space to support administration
 sales
 and engineering staff and independent contractors and 30
000 square feet of
manufacturing space
 which includes a secured inventory area
 shipping and receiving areas
 and manufacturing and assembly space.

We
believe that the facilities and equipment described above are generally in good condition
 well maintained
 and suitable and adequate
for our current and projected operating needs.

ITEM
3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

From
time to time
 we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business.
However
 litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties
 and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time
to time that may harm our business. See Note 7 to the financial statements.


Play
Beverages
 LLC
 and CirTran Beverage Corp. v. Playboy Enterprises
 Inc.

 Cook County
 Illinois
 Case No. 2012L012181.
In October 2016
 the court entered an order
 following a jury trial
 against plaintiffs dismissing their claims against Playboy
and awarding Playboy $1.6 million in damages for breach of a license agreement and $5.0 million damages for trademark infringement
and counterfeiting. Plaintiffs filed a motion for a new trial
 which was denied in late 2018. Playboy has initiated collection
efforts against Play Beverages

December 31
 2018 and 2017
 related to this judgment.

In
addition to the foregoing
 we are parties to ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business that

ITEM
5. MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY
 RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND SMALL BUSINESS ISSUER PURCHASE OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Market
Information

Our
common stock is not quoted or traded in any public market. Without an active public trading market
 a stockholder may not
be able to liquidate their shares. If a market does develop
 the price for our securities may be highly volatile and may bear
no relationship to our actual financial condition or results of operations. Factors we discuss in this report
 including the many
risks associated with an investment in our securities
 may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock.

The
ability of individual stockholders to trade their shares in a particular state may be subject to various rules and regulations
of that state. A number of states require that an issuer&rsquo;s securities be registered in their state or appropriately exempted
from registration before the securities are permitted to trade in that state. Presently
 we have no plans to register our securities
in any particular state.

Holders
of Common Stock

As
of December 31
 2018
 we had 489 stockholders of record of the 4
499
918
984 common shares outstanding.



If
we were to have earnings
 payment of dividends is subject
to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend
 among other things
 upon our earnings
 our capital
requirements
 our financial condition
 and other relevant factors. We have not paid or declared any dividends upon our common
stock since our inception and
 by reason of our present financial status and our contemplated financial requirements
 do not anticipate
paying any dividends upon our common stock in the foreseeable future.

We
have never declared or paid any cash dividends. We currently have no earnings and do not intend to pay cash dividends in
the foreseeable future on the shares of common stock. We intend to reinvest any earnings we might achieve in the development
and expansion of our business. Any cash dividends in the future to common stockholders will be payable when
 as and if declared
by our board of directors
 based upon the Board&rsquo;s assessment of:



    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
prior claims of preferred
    stock to the extent issued and outstanding; and

    
    
other factors
 including
    any applicable laws.


It
is very unlikely that we will declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.


Securities
Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans

We
currently accrue stock options for certain employees under our stock option plan. However
 there are not adequate shares available
under the plan to issue the options and as a result have not been issued. See Note 6 to the financial statements.

Recent
Sales of Unregistered Securities

We
have no recent sales of unregistered securities.

7. MANAGEMENT&rsquo;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Except
for the historical information
 the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
We caution you not to put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements
 which speak only as of the date of this report. Our
actual results or actions may differ materially from these forward-looking statements for many reasons
 including the risks described
in &ldquo;Risk Factors&rdquo; and elsewhere in this annual report. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and with the understanding
that our actual future results may be materially different from what we currently expect.

Going
Concern

The
future of our company is dependent upon its ability to identify and commence a business opportunity
 obtain financing and
achieve future profitable operations. Management intends to seek additional capital through a private placement
or public offering of its common stock
 if necessary. Our auditors have expressed a going concern opinion which raises
substantial doubts about the Issuers ability to continue as a going concern.

MANAGEMENTS&rsquo;
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



Until
October 2016
 we manufactured
 marketed
 and distributed internationally an energy drink under a license with Playboy Enterprises
Inc. (&ldquo;Playboy&rdquo;)
 through our subsidiary
 CirTran Beverage Corporation (&ldquo;CirTran Beverage&rdquo;). CirTran Beverage
manufactured
 marketed
 and distributed Playboy-branded energy drinks in accordance with its agreement with Play Beverages
 LLC
(&ldquo;PlayBev&rdquo;)
 which held the Playboy license. An Illinois court determined in October 2016 that PlayBev no longer had
the right to distribute the Playboy-branded beverage. Following the adverse court ruling
 we filed a motion for a retrial
 which
was denied in late 2018. PlayBev was previously consolidated as a variable interest entity. However
 at October 21
 2016
we deconsolidated PlayBev from our consolidated financial statements.

Since
October 2016
 we have had minimal revenue from consulting services we provided to third parties.

During
2018 and 2017
 our activities declined rapidly
 restrained by the necessity to prioritize obtaining the forbearance of our principal
secured and judgment creditors
 seeking to resolve disputes respecting the PlayBev license to market Playboy-licensed energy drinks
defending the numerous lawsuits to which we were a party
 and obtaining additional capital. Further
 disputes respecting
the status of the PlayBev license to market energy drinks impaired our ability to establish new distributors
 damaged our relationships
with existing distributors
 and considerably depressed revenues.

We
are seeking to commercialize consumer products and provide a mix of high- and medium-volume turnkey manufacturing services and
products using various high-tech applications for leading electronics OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) in the communications
networking
 peripherals
 gaming
 law enforcement
 consumer products
 telecommunications
 automotive
 medical
 and semiconductor
industries. We expect our business activities may include pre-manufacturing
 manufacturing
 and post-manufacturing
services. Our goal is to provide potential customers with total manufacturing solutions through third-party providers for
both new and more mature products
 as well as across product generations.

Comparison
of Years Ended December 31
 2018 and 2017

Sales
and Cost of Sales

Revenues
for the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017 were $0 and $12
500
 respectively. Revenues generated during the year ended December
31
 2017 were limited to one time consulting engagements that did not recur during the year ended December 31
 2018.


    
    


Operating
Expenses

During
the year ended December 31
 2018
 selling
 general
 and administrative expenses decreased by 44%
 as compared to the preceding
year
 as a result of the termination of salary accruals.

Other
Income and Expense

Other
expenses during the year ended December 31
 2018
 consisted solely of approximately $500
000 of interest expense. Other expenses
during the year ended December 31
 2017
 included approximately $490
000 for interest expense and $500
000 for losses recognized
on the settlement of debt. Interest expense was approximately equal for each year because the principal amount of indebtedness
and applicable interest rate were approximately the same.

As
a result of the foregoing
 we had a loss from continuing operations of $0.9 million during the year ended December 31
 2018
 as
compared to $1.8 million during the year ended December 31
 2017.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

We
have had a history of losses from operations
 as our expenses have been greater than our declining revenues
 which have now ceased
entirely. Our accumulated deficit was $77.7 million at December 31
 2018. For the year ended December 31
 2018
 we used negligible
net cash of $5
610 from operating and financing activities
 compared to net positive cash flow of $5
551 for the prior year
 from
operating and financing activities.

During
the year ended December 31
 2018
 we used $208
990 of net cash in operations
 comprised of a net loss from continuing operations
of $946
166
 non cash losses of $244
026
 changes in working capital of $498
025
 and net cash used in discontinued operations
of $4
875. The net change in working capital was primarily driven by an increase in accrued interest of $494
254.

During
the year ended December 31
 2017
 we used $206
894 of net cash in operations
 comprised of a net loss from continuing operations
of $1
790
708
 non cash losses of $695
055
 changes in working capital of $921
825
 and net cash used in discontinued operations
of $33
066. The net change in working capital was primarily driven by an increase in accounts payable for $361
042 and an increase
in accrued interest of $489
057.

During
the year ended December 31
 2018
 we generated $203
380 of net cash from financing activities comprised solely of proceeds from
related party loans.

During
the year ended December 31
 2017
 we generated $212
445 of net cash from financing activities comprised of a repayment of bank
overdrafts of $2
620
 proceeds from related-party loans of $457
758
 repayments of related-party loans totaling $442
693
 and
proceeds from convertible loans payable of $200
000.

Our
Capital Resources and Anticipated Requirements

Our
monthly operating costs and interest expense average approximately $80
000 per month
 excluding capital expenditures. We continue
to focus on generating revenue and reducing our monthly business expenses through cost reductions and operational streamlining.
Currently
 we do not have enough cash on hand to sustain our business operations
 and we expect to access external capital resources
in the near future.

In
conjunction with our efforts to commercialize new products
 we are actively seeking infusions of capital from investors. In our
current financial condition
 it is unlikely that we will be able to obtain additional debt financing. Even if we did acquire additional
debt
 we would be required to devote additional cash flow to servicing the debt and securing the debt with assets.

Accordingly
we are looking to obtain equity financing to meet our anticipated capital needs. We cannot assure that we will be successful in
obtaining such capital. If we were to issue additional shares for debt and/or equity
 this would dilute the value of our common
stock and existing stockholders&rsquo; positions. We also have no authorized but unissued capital available
 and we are dependent
on the Amendment becoming effective in order to obtain any new equity financing.


    
    


Convertible
Debentures

We
currently have an amended
 restated
 and consolidated secured convertible debenture with Tekfine
 LLC
 an unrelated entity
 with
a maturity date of April 30
 2027
 to the extent not previously converted. The amended debenture had a total outstanding principal
balance of $2.4 million
 with accrued interest of $1.2 million as of December 31
 2018. In addition
 we have a $200
000 convertible
debenture with Tekfine
 with a maturity date of October 20
 2018
 unless earlier converted. The convertible debentures and accrued
interest are convertible into shares of our common stock at the lower of $0.10 or the lowest bid price for the 20 trading days
prior to conversion. As of the date of this report
 we are unable to convert this debenture because we have insufficient authorized
but unissued shares to issue upon conversion.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Recently
issued accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that require adoption
and that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements upon
adoption.

Off-balance
Sheet Arrangements

The
Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements and does not anticipate entering into any such arrangements in the foreseeable future.

Critical
Accounting Policies

The
methods
 estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report
in our financial statements
 which we discuss under the heading &ldquo;Results of Operations&rdquo; following this section of
our MD&amp;A. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments
 often as a result of the
need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.

We
set forth below those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor&rsquo;s understanding
of our financial results and condition and that require complex management judgment.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of the Company&rsquo;s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company&rsquo;s periodic filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission include
 where applicable
 disclosures of estimates
 assumptions
 uncertainties and markets that could
affect the financial statements and future operations of the Company.

Fair
value of financial instruments

The
carrying amounts reflected in the balance sheets for cash
 accounts payable and related party payables approximate the respective
fair values due to the short maturities of these items. The Company does not hold any investments that are available-for-sale.

As
required by the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC
 fair value is measured based on a three-tier fair
value hierarchy
 which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted
prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs
 other than the quoted prices in active markets
 that are observable either directly
or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data
 which require the reporting entity
to develop its own assumptions.


    
    


The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:

Level
1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical
 unrestricted assets or
liabilities;

Level
2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active
 or inputs that are observable
 either directly or indirectly
 for substantially
the full term of the asset or liability;

Level
3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable
(supported by little or no market activity).

The
Company does not currently have any financial instruments that it measures at fair value.

Report
of Independent Registered PUBLIC Accounting Firm

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of CirTran Corporation:

Opinion
on the Financial Statements

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CirTran Corporation (&ldquo;the Company&rdquo;) as of December 31
2018 and 2017
 the related consolidated statements of operations
 stockholders&rsquo; deficit
 and cash flows for each of the
years in the two-year period ended December 31
 2018 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;financial statements&rdquo;).
In our opinion
 the financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of
the Company as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the
two-year period ended December 31
 2018
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Explanatory
Paragraph Regarding Going Concern

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 3 to the financial statements
 the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency
that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are
also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Basis
for Opinion

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company&rsquo;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error
or fraud. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits
 we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
 but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly
 we express no such opinion.

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to
error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining on a test basis
 evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

CIRTRAN
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER
31
 2018 AND 2017

NOTE
1 - ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS

CirTran
Corporation (&ldquo;Cirtran
&rdquo; &ldquo;the Company&rdquo; or &ldquo;we&rdquo;) now without significant operations due to shortages
of working capital
 through our different subsidiaries
 has provided a mix of high- and medium-volume turnkey manufacturing
services and products using various high-tech applications for leading electronics original equipment manufacturers in the communications
networking
 peripherals
 gaming
 law enforcement
 consumer products
 telecommunications
 automotive
 medical
 semiconductor and
beverage industries. Our service capabilities include pre-manufacturing
 manufacturing
 and post-manufacturing services.
Our goal is to offer customers the significant competitive advantages that can be obtained from manufacture outsourcing.

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles
of Consolidation

We
consolidate all of our majority-owned subsidiaries
 companies over which we exercise control through majority voting rights
 and
companies in which we have a variable interest and we are the primary beneficiary. We account for our investments in common stock
of other companies that we do not control
 but over which we can exert significant influence using the cost method.

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CirTran Corporation and our wholly owned subsidiaries: CirTran Beverage
Corp.
 CirTran Products Corp.
 CirTran Online Corp.
 CirTran Media Corp.
 CirTran Corporation (Utah)
 CirTran - Asia
 Inc.
 and
Racore Network
 Inc. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Use
of Estimates

In
preparing the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
 the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue
Recognition

We
follow Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) 606

from Contracts with Customers
 the for revenue recognition. Adoption of ASC 606 did not have a significant impact on our financial
statements. We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those products or services. Revenue is recognized net of allowances
for returns and any taxes collected from customers
 which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.


    
    


Cash
and Cash Equivalents

We
consider all highly liquid
 short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We
did not hold any cash equivalents as of December 31
 2018 or 2017.

Investment
in Securities

Our
cost-method investment consists of an investment in a private digital multi-media technology company that totaled $300
000 at
December 31
 2018 and 2017. As we owned less than 20% of that company&rsquo;s stock as of each date
 and no significant influence
or control exists
 the investment is accounted for using the cost method. We evaluated the investment for impairment and determined
there was none during the periods presented.

Property
and Equipment

We
incur certain costs associated with the design and development of molds and dies for our contract-manufacturing segment. These
costs are held as deposits on the balance sheet until the molds or dies are finished and ready for use. At that point
 the costs
are included as part of production equipment in property and equipment and are amortized over their useful lives. We hold title
to all molds and dies used in the manufacture of products. The capitalized cost
 net of accumulated depreciation
 associated with
molds and dies included in property and equipment at December 31
 2018 and 2017
 was$12
065 and $14
357
 respectively.

Depreciation
expense is recognized in amounts equal to the cost of depreciable assets over estimated service lives. Leasehold improvements
are amortized over the shorter of the life of the lease or the service life of the improvements. The straight-line method of depreciation
and amortization is followed for financial reporting purposes. Maintenance
 repairs
 and renewals
 which neither materially add
to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred. Gains or losses on dispositions
of property and equipment are included in operating results.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets

We
review our long-lived assets
 including intangibles
 for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. At each balance sheet date
 we evaluate whether events and circumstances have
occurred that indicate possible impairment. We use an estimate of future undiscounted net cash flows from the related asset or
group of assets over their remaining life in measuring whether the assets are recoverable. We did not record expenses for the
impairment of long-lived assets during the year ended December 31
 2018 or 2017.

Financial
Instruments with Derivative Features

We
do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. However
 we have financial instruments that are considered derivatives
or contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting. Embedded derivatives are valued separately from the host instrument
and are recognized as derivative liabilities in our balance sheet. We measure these instruments at their estimated fair value
and recognize changes in their estimated fair value in results of operations during the period of change. We have estimated the
fair value of these embedded derivatives using a Multi-NomialLattis model. The fair values of the derivative instruments are measured
each reporting period.

During
the year ended December 31
 2017
 our common stock was suspended from trading. Because of this
 the convertible note no longer
met the criteria to bifurcate the instrument under Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) Accounting Standard
Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) 815
. As such
 we determined the underlying common stock of the
instruments being accounted for as derivative liabilities had no value. As a result
 the fair value of the derivative liabilities
as of the date our common stock was no longer available to trade was written off to additional paid-in capital in accordance with
ASC 815-15-35-4. During the year ended December 31
 2018
 we became current with its filing requirements with the SEC. However
we have not yet received clearance from FINRA for our stock to resume trading. As such
 we determined the underlying common stock
of the debt instruments had no value as of December 31
 2018.


    
    


Stock-Based
Compensation

We
outstanding stock options to directors and employees
. We account for our stock
options in accordance with ASC 718-10
 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
 which requires the recognition of the cost of
employee services received in exchanged for an award of equity instruments in the financial statements and is measured based on
the grant date fair value of the award. ASC 718-10 also requires the stock option compensation expense to be recognized over the
period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (typically the vesting period).

Stock-based
employee compensation was $480 and $1
340 for the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.

Income
Taxes

We
the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under
the liability method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and
the tax basis of assets
 liabilities
 the carry forward of operating losses and tax credits
 and are measured using the enacted
tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. An allowance against deferred tax assets
is recorded when it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will not be realized. Research tax credits are recognized as
used.

Concentrations
of Risk

During
the year ended December 31
 2017
 we generated revenues totaling $12
500 which were from one customer. There were no revenues
during the year ended December 31
 2018.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The
carrying amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for cash
 notes payable
 and accounts payable
approximate fair values because of the immediate or short-term maturities of these financial instruments. The carrying amounts
of our debt obligations approximate fair value.

ASC
820-10-15
 
 defines fair value
 thereby eliminating inconsistencies
in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements
 and increases disclosures surrounding fair value calculations. ASC
820-10-15 establishes a three-tiered fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used in fair value calculations.
The three levels of inputs are defined as follows:

Level
1&mdash;Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level
2&mdash;Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
asset or liability
 such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets
or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations
in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from
 or corroborated by
 observable market data.

Level
3&mdash;Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are
significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

Accounts
payable and related-party payables have fair values that approximate the carrying value due to the short-term nature of these
instruments.


    
    


Loss
Per Share

Basic
loss per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding during each period. Diluted EPS is similarly calculated
 except that the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding would include common shares that may be issued subject to existing rights with dilutive potential when applicable.
We did not have any potentially issuable common shares at December 31
 2018 and 2017.

Short-term
Advances

We
have short-term advances with various individuals. These advances are due upon demand
 carry no interest
 and are not collateralized.
These advances are classified as short-term liabilities.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Recently
issued accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that require adoption
and that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements upon
adoption.

NOTE
3&mdash;GOING CONCERN AND REALIZATION OF ASSETS

In
October 2016
 we lost our ability to continue energy drink distribution
 our principal source of revenue
 after receiving an unfavorable
ruling in our suit against Playboy Enterprises
 Inc.

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America
 which contemplate our continuation as a going concern. We had a working capital deficiency of
$36
653
372 and $35
750
688 as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively
 and a net loss of $1
111
221 and $2
049
862 during
the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively. As of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 we had an accumulated deficit of $77
710
520
and $76
599
299
 respectively. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

Our
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully accomplish our business plan described in
the following paragraphs and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any
adjustments that may be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.

In
the coming year
 our foreseeable cash requirements will relate to development of business operations and associated expenses.
We may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital.

Historically
we have mostly relied upon shareholder loans and advances to finance operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital
by retaining net earnings
 if any
 or through future public or private offerings of our stock or loans from private investors
although we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain such financing. Our failure to do so could have a material and adverse
effect upon us and our shareholders.

NOTE
5 &ndash; RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Transactions
involving Officers
 Directors
 and Stockholders

In
2007
 we issued a 10% promissory note to a family member of our president in exchange for $300
000. The note was due on demand
after May 2008. There were no repayments made during the periods presented. At December 31
 2018 and 2017
 the principal amount
owing on the note was $151
833 and $151
833
 respectively.

On
March 31
 2008
 we issued to this same family member
 along with two other Company shareholders
 promissory notes totaling $315
000
($105
000 each). Under the terms of these three $105
000 notes
 we received total proceeds of $300
000 and agreed to repay the
amount received plus a 5% borrowing fee. The notes were due April 30
 2008
 after which they were due on demand
 with interest
accruing at 12% per annum. We made no payments towards the outstanding notes during the periods presented. The principal balance
owing on the notes as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 totaled $72
466 and $72
466
 respectively
 and are presented in liabilities
from discontinued operations.

During
the year ended December 31
 2018
 we received cash advances from related parties of $203
380. Additionally
 a related party
forgave outstanding payables of $92
000 and related parties paid expenses totaling $241
734 directly to vendors on our
behalf. There was $873
721 and $520
608 of short-term advances due to related parties as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.
The advances are due on demand and as such included in current liabilities.

We
have agreed to issue options to Iehab Hawatmeh
 our president
 as compensation for services provided as our chief executive officer.
The terms of this employment agreement require us to grant options to purchase 6
000
000 shares of our stock each year
 with an
exercise price equal to the fair market price of our common stock as of the grant date. During the year ended December 31
 2018
we accrued for 6
000
000 stock options relating to this employee agreement
 resulting in 66.0 million and 60.0 million accrued
stock options as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
Note

NOTE
7 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation
and Claims

Various
vendors
 service providers
 and others have asserted legal claims in previous years. These creditors generally are not actively
seeking collection of amounts due them
 and we have determined that the probability of realizing any loss on these claims is remote
and will seek to compromise and settle at a deep discount any of such claims that are asserted for collection. These amounts are
included in our current liabilities. We have not accrued any liability for claims or judgments that we have determined to be barred
by the applicable statute of limitations
 which generally is eight years for judgments in Utah.




    
    


Noble
Gate

In
September 2015
 we obtained a judgment in the amount of $287
000 against Noble Gate Industrial
 a former authorized distributor
of the Playboy-branded energy drink. We believe the judgment is uncollectible and have not undertaken collection efforts in view
of our analysis of the costs of collection as compared to any likely recovery. No gain has been recorded for the periods presented.

Playboy
Enterprises
 Inc.

Our
affiliate
 Play Beverages
 LLC
 filed suit against Playboy Enterprises
 Inc.
 in Cook County
 Illinois
 Circuit Court in
October 2012 asserting numerous claims
 including breach of contract and tortious interference. Playboy responded with a counterclaim
of breach of contract and trademark infringement. After proceedings in October 2016
 the court awarded a judgment to Playboy of
$6.6 million against Play Beverages and us. The court denied our motion for a new trial and awarded Playboy treble patent infringement
damages and attorney&rsquo;s fees. We filed a notice of appeal in July 2017 and again in March 2018. Playboy has initiated collection
efforts but has recovered no funds. We have accrued $17
205
599 as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 related to this judgment
 which
). In September 2018
the appellate court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.

Redi
FZE

During
the year ended December 31
 2011
 Redi FZE sued us claiming alleged breach of contract
 and we counterclaimed against it. On November
2
 2011
 the court issued an injunction against Redi FZE prohibiting it from selling and distributing Playboy-branded products
in conjunction with its distribution agreement with us. On August 16
 2012
 Redi FZE withdrew the suit
 and on October 30
 2012
we were awarded a default judgment against Redi in the amount of $1
225
155. We have not collected on this judgment and are weighing
the cost of collection against the likelihood of success. No gain or receivable has been recorded in the financial statements
for the periods presented in connection with this case.

Old
Dominion Freight Line

In
December 2009
 Old Dominion Freight Line filed suit against us for unpaid freight services in the amount of $30
464 and was awarded
a default judgment of $33
187 in March 2010. The amount due is included in accounts payable as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
respectively.

RDS
Touring

In
September 2011
 RDS Touring and Promotions
 Inc. was awarded a default judgment of $118
426 against us. In September 2012
 RDS
domesticated the default judgment in the state of Utah and sought to enforce the judgment against us. We have and will continue
to resist the collection efforts by RDS. We had recorded a loss equal to the judgment of $118
426
 of which $18
491 was previously
paid leaving $99
935 included in liabilities from discontinued operations as of December 31
 2018 and 2017.



In
July 2010
 Jimmy Esebag was awarded a judgment against us for breach of contract. A judgment debtor examination of an affiliate
took place in October 2013
 and there have been no further recovery efforts to date. We will continue to resist the collection
efforts from this judgment. We had recorded a loss equal to the judgment of $100
000
 of which $40
881 was previously paid leaving
$59
119 included in liabilities from discontinued operations as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.

General
Distributors
 Inc.

In
February 2012
 General Distributors
 Inc. (&ldquo;General&rdquo;) and was awarded a default judgment of $93
856 against us. In
January 2013
 General domesticated the default judgment in the state of Utah and sought to enforce the judgment against us.
We have and will continue to resist the collection efforts by General. We had recorded a loss equal to the judgment of $93
856
which is included in liabilities from discontinued operations as of December 31
 2018 and 2017.


    
    


Advanced
Beauty Solutions

In
connection with prior litigation with Advanced Beauty Solutions (&ldquo;ABS&rdquo;)
 it claimed nonperformance by us and filed
an adversary proceeding in its bankruptcy case in the United States Bankruptcy Court. On March 17
 2009
 the bankruptcy court
entered judgment in favor of ABS and against us in the amount of $1
811
667
 plus interest. On September 11
 2009
 the bankruptcy
court denied our motion to set aside the judgment.

On
September 8
 2010
 we executed an Assignment of Copyrights
 thereby assigning our Copyright Registration No. TX-6-064-955
 Copyright
Registration No. TX-6-064-956
 and Copyright to the True Ceramic Pro-Live Ops (TCPS) infomercial and related master tapes (collectively
the &ldquo;Copyrights&rdquo;) to ABS
 without reservation or exclusion
 making ABS the owner of the Copyrights.

Despite
motions
 hearings
 appeals
 and mediation in 2011
 both parties were unable to resolve their outstanding issues.

On
March 22
 2012
 we entered into a formal forbearance agreement with ABS
 dated as of March 1
 2012 (the &ldquo;ABS Forbearance
Agreement&rdquo;)
 whereby ABS agreed to take no further judgment enforcement actions in consideration of our payment of $25
000
upon execution
 satisfaction of applicable conditions precedent
 return of the trademarks and intellectual property previously
conveyed by ABS to us
 and our obligation to pay $1
835
000 secured by an encumbrance on all of our assets
 subject and subordinate
to the prior lien and encumbrance in favor of YA Global. In addition
 we stipulated to an additional judgment for attorney&rsquo;s
fees incurred in negotiating the ABS Forbearance Agreement and related post-judgment collection efforts. The ABS Forbearance Agreement
also provided that our obligation would be reduced by the greater of the amount of credit granted in the bankruptcy proceedings
for the value of the intellectual property we previously conveyed to ABS and the amount received by ABS from the sale of such
intellectual property to a third party during the term of the ABS Forbearance Agreement
 plus the amount of any distribution to
which we are entitled as a creditor of ABS
 subject to other limitations.

In
May 2013
 ABS sent us a notice of default under the ABS Forbearance Agreement. Although there were some negotiations between us
and ABS following the notice of default
 this matter has not been resolved.

Our
appeal of the approximately $1.8 million judgment that had been remanded in the ABS bankruptcy proceedings to conclusively determine
the amount of credit due us for the conveyance of the intellectual property has been dismissed. All litigation and disputes between
ABS and its affiliates
 on the one hand
 and us and our affiliates
 on the other hand
 have been dismissed.

We
have assigned to ABS our creditor claim against the estate of ABS
 to the extent of the balance due under the ABS Forbearance
Agreement. Any distribution from the ABS estate in excess of the adjusted amounts due under the ABS Forbearance Agreement will
be paid to us.

Because
ABS&rsquo;s lien is subordinate to liens on all of our assets in favor of Y.A. Global and/or Tekfine
 LLC
 ABS is unable to presently
take any steps to enforce its judgment. If that changes
 we would potentially face collection actions on the judgment
 subject
to our offset claims for the intellectual property and creditor claim.

We
had accrued the minimum liability of $90
000
 of which $45
000 has been paid leaving $45
000 due
 which is included in accrued
liabilities as of December 31
 2018 and 2017. Because the remaining liability is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated
 no
additional amounts have been accrued.

Delinquent
Payroll Taxes
 Interest
 and Penalties

In
November 2004
 the IRS accepted our amended offer in compromise (the &ldquo;Offer&rdquo;) to settle delinquent payroll taxes
interest
 and penalties
 which requires us to pay $500
000
 remain current in our payment of taxes for five years
 and forego
claiming any net operating losses for the years 2001 through 2015 or until we pay taxes on future profits in an amount equal to
the taxes of $1
455
767 waived by the Offer. In June 2013
 we entered into a partial installment agreement to pay $768
526 in
unpaid 2009 payroll taxes
 which requires us to pay the IRS 5% of cash deposits. The monthly payments are to continue until the
account balances are paid in full or until the collection statute of limitation expires on October 6
 2020. There was $424
158
and $367
617 due as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 of which $122
222 and $108
754 is included in liabilities from discontinued
operations.


    
    


Employment
Agreements

We
engage Iehab Hawatmeh
 our president and chief executive officer
 through an employment agreement entered in August 2009 and amended
in September 2017
 with a salary in an amount and commencement date to be determined. In July 2017
 Mr. Hawatmeh resigned all
positions with us to pursue other business activities
 thereby effectively terminating the agreement. However
 in September 2017
we reinstated Mr. Hawatmeh to his previous positions and reinstated his employment agreement. Among other things
 the reinstated
employment agreement: (a) grants options to purchase a minimum of 6
000
000 shares of our stock each year
 with an exercise price
equal to the market price of our common stock as of the grant date
 for the maximum term allowed under our stock option plan;
(b) provides for health insurance coverage
 cell phone
 car allowance
 life insurance
 and director and officer liability insurance
as well as any other bonus approved by our board; and (c) includes additional incentive compensation as follows: (i) a quarterly
bonus equal to 5% of our earnings before interest
 taxes
 depreciation and amortization for the applicable quarter; (ii) bonuses
equal to 1% of the net purchase price of any acquisitions we complete that are directly generated and arranged by Mr. Hawatmeh;
and (iii) an annual bonus (payable quarterly) equal to 1% of our gross sales of all products
 net of returns and allowances.

In
addition to the employment agreement above
 we have verbal contracts with our employees that require payment of noncash compensation
in a fixed number of shares. During the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 we did not grant options to purchase shares of
common stock to employees due to the insufficient common shares available. We recorded expenses totaling $480 and $1
340 during
the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively
 for employee options relating to the employment contracts of these employees.

NOTE
10 &ndash; LEASES


In
an effort to operate more efficiently and focus resources on higher margin areas of our business
 on March 5
 2010
 we entered
into certain agreements (collectively
 the &ldquo;Agreements&rdquo;) to reduce our costs with Katana Electronics
 LLC
 a Utah
limited liability company (&ldquo;Katana&rdquo;). The Agreements include an Assignment and Assumption Agreement
 an Equipment
Lease
 and a Sublease Agreement relating to our property. Pursuant to the terms of the Sublease
 we agreed to sublease a certain
portion of our premises to Katana
 consisting of the warehouse and office space used as of the close of business on March 4
 2010.
The term of the Sublease was for two months with automatic renewal periods of one month each. The base rent under the Sublease
is $8
500 per month. The Sublease contains normal and customary use restrictions
 indemnification rights and obligations
 default
provisions
 and termination rights. Under the Agreements signed
 we continue to have rights to operate as a contract manufacturer
in the future in the U.S. and offshore. On July 1
 2011
 Katana had assumed the full lease payment
 and we agreed to pay Katana
$5
000 per month on a month to month basis for the use of office space and utilities. We had no sublease income for the years
ended December 31
 2018 or 2017. We recorded rent expense of $42
000 and $57
000 for the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
respectively.

NOTE
11- INCOME TAXES

We
did not provide any current or deferred U.S. federal income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because
we have experienced operating losses since inception. When it is more likely than not that a tax asset cannot be realized through
future income the company must allow for this future tax benefit. We provided a full valuation allowance on the net deferred
tax asset
 consisting of net operating loss carry forwards
 because management has determined that it is more likely than not
that we will not earn income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets during the carry forward period.

We
 not taken a tax position that
 if challenged
 would have
a material effect on the financial statements for the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017 applicable under FASB ASC 740. We
did not recognize any adjustment to the liability for uncertain tax position and therefore did not record any adjustment to the
beginning balance of accumulated deficit on the balance sheet. All of our tax returns remain open.

As
of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 we had net operating loss carryforwards for tax reporting purposes of approximately $41.5
and $41.2 million. These net operating loss carryforwards
 if unused
 begin to expire in 2020. Utilization of approximately $1.2
million of the total net operating loss is dependent on the future profitable operation of Racore Network
 Inc.
 a wholly owned
subsidiary
 under the separate return limitation rules and restrictions on utilizing net operating loss carryforwards after a
change in ownership. In addition
 the realization of tax benefits relating to net operating loss carryforwards is limited due
to the settlement related to amounts previously due to the IRS
 as discussed in 


    
    


The
provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before
provision for income taxes. The sources and tax effects of the differences for the periods presented are as follows:

ITEM
9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

We
have had no disagreements with our independent auditors on accounting or financial disclosures.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

As
of December 31
 2018
 we carried out an evaluation
 under the supervision and with the participation of management
 including
our chief executive and financial officer
 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
Based upon that evaluation
 management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December
31
 2018
 to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized
 and reported within the periods prescribed by U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management
 including our chief executive and financial
officer
 as appropriate
 to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

In
designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures
 management recognizes that any controls and procedures
 no matter
how well designed and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Also
the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
 have been detected. These inherent limitations
include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or
mistake. The design of any system of controls is based
 in part
 upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.


    
    


Management&rsquo;s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
 as is defined in the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. These internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the reported financial information is presented
fairly
 that disclosures are adequate and that the judgments inherent in the preparation of financial statements are reasonable.
There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal controls
 including the possibility of human error
and overriding of controls. Consequently
 an effective internal control system can only provide reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance
with respect to reporting financial information.

Our
internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to maintaining records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
for preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the receipts and expenditures
of company assets are made and in accordance with our management and directors authorization; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of assets that could have a material
effect on our financial statements.

Management
has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and
criteria established in the Internal Control &ndash; Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (&ldquo;COSO&rdquo;). Based upon this evaluation
 management concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was not effective as of December 31
 2018.

Based
on that evaluation
 management concluded that
 during the period covered by this report
 such internal controls and procedures
were not effective due to the following material weakness identified:




    
    
Lack
    of appropriate segregation of duties


    
    
    

    
    
Lack
    of control procedures that include multiple levels of supervision and review
 

    
    
    

    
    
Lack
    of financial resources to engage adequate external expertise; and

    
    
    

    
    
Overreliance
upon independent financial reporting consultants for review
    of critical accounting areas and disclosures and material
 nonstandard transactions.


This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management&rsquo;s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting
firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only the management&rsquo;s report in this annual report.

Implemented
or Planned Remedial Actions in Response to the Material Weaknesses

We
will continue to strive to correct the above noted weakness in internal control once we have adequate funds to do so. We believe
appointing a director who qualifies as a financial expert will improve the overall performance of our control over our financial
reporting.

Because
of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31
 2018 that materially
affect
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.


    
    



Our
management
 including our chief executive and financial officer
 does not expect that our disclosure controls
or internal controls will prevent all errors or all fraud. A control system
 no matter how well conceived and operated
 can provide
only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition
 the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
 and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to
their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
 within a company have been detected. These inherent limitations include
the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty
 and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.

 and chief executive officer since July
2000
 except for a brief absence during 2017. Mr. Hawatmeh oversees all daily operations
 including our technical and sales functions.

 Salt Lake City
 Utah
 overseeing that company&rsquo;s contract
manufacturing printed circuit board assembly division. In addition

Family
Relationships

There
are no family relationships among any of our officers or directors.


    
    


Indemnification
of Directors and Officers

Our
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws both provide for the indemnification of our officers and directors to the fullest extent
permitted by Washington

Limitation
of Liability of Directors

Pursuant
to the Nevada law under which we are organized
 our Articles of Incorporation exclude personal liability for our Directors
for monetary damages based upon any violation of their fiduciary duties as Directors
 except as to liability for any breach of
the duty of loyalty
 acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law
or any transaction from which a Director receives an improper personal benefit. This exclusion of liability does not limit any
right which a Director may have to be indemnified and does not affect any Director&rsquo;s liability under federal or applicable
state securities laws. We have agreed to indemnify our directors against expenses
 judgments
 and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim against a Director if he acted in good faith and in a manner he believed to be in our best interests.

Election
of Directors and Officers

Directors
are elected to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors have been elected and qualified.
Officers are appointed to serve until the meeting of the board of directors following the next annual meeting of
stockholders and until their successors have been elected and qualified.

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings

No
Executive Officer or Director of the Corporation has been the subject of any Order
 Judgment
 or Decree of any Court of competent
jurisdiction
 or any regulatory agency permanently or temporarily enjoining
 barring suspending or otherwise limiting him/her
from acting as an investment advisor
 underwriter
 broker or dealer in the securities industry
 or as an affiliated person
 director
or employee of an investment company
 bank
 savings and loan association
 or insurance company or from engaging in or continuing
any conduct or practice in connection with any such activity or in connection with the purchase or sale of any securities.

No
Executive Officer or Director of the Corporation has been convicted in any criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations)
or is the subject of a criminal proceeding which is currently pending.

No
Executive Officer or Director of the Corporation is the subject of any pending legal proceedings.

Audit
Committee and Financial Expert

We
do not have an Audit Committee. Our directors perform some of the same functions of an Audit Committee
 such as: recommending
a firm of independent certified public accountants to audit the annual financial statements; reviewing the independent auditor&rsquo;s
independence
 the financial statements and their audit report; and reviewing management&rsquo;s administration of the system of
internal accounting controls. We do not currently have a written audit committee charter or similar document.

We
have no financial expert. We believe the cost related to retaining a financial expert at this time is prohibitive. Further
 because
of our start-up operations
 we believe the services of a financial expert are not warranted.

Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance


Section
16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;)
 requires our executive officers and
directors
 and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of an issuer&rsquo;s common stock
 which has been registered
under Section 12 of the Exchange Act
 to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the SEC. Our
executive officers and directors have not filed any of the required reports.


Corporate
Governance

Nominating
Committee

We
do not have a Nominating Committee or Nominating Committee Charter. Our board of directors performs some of the
functions associated with a Nominating Committee. We have elected not to have a Nominating Committee in that we are an initial-stages
operating company with limited operations and resources.

Employment
Agreements&mdash;Change in Control

On
August 1
 2009
 we entered into an Employment Agreement with Iehab Hawatmeh
 our president
 that amends and restates in their
entirety the previous employment agreement and amendment with Mr. Hawatmeh. The employment term continues and extends automatically
from each August for successive one-year periods
 with an annual base salary of $345
000. The employment agreement
 among other
things: (a) grants options to purchase a minimum of 6
000
000 shares of our stock each year
 with the exercise price of the options
being the market price of our common stock as of the grant date
 for the maximum term allowed under our stock option plan; (b)
provides for health insurance coverage
 cell phone
 car allowance
 life insurance
 and director and officer liability insurance
as well as any other bonus approved by our board; (c) includes additional incentive compensation as follows: (i) a quarterly bonus
equal to 5% of our earnings before interest
 taxes
 depreciation and amortization for the applicable quarter; (ii) bonuses equal
to 1% of the net purchase price of any acquisitions we complete that are directly generated and arranged by Mr. Hawatmeh; and
(iii) an annual bonus (payable quarterly) equal to 1% of our gross sales of all beverage products
 net of returns and allowances.

Pursuant
to the Employment Agreement
 Mr. Hawatmeh&rsquo;s employment may be terminated for cause
 or upon death or disability
 in which
event we are required to pay him any unpaid base salary and unpaid earned bonuses. In the event that Mr. Hawatmeh is terminated
without cause
 we are required to pay to him: (i) within 30 days following such termination
 any benefit
 incentive
 or equity
plan
 program
 or practice (the &ldquo;Accrued Obligations&rdquo;) paid when such would have been paid to him if employed; (ii)
within 30 days following such termination (or on the earliest later date as may be required by Internal Revenue Code Section 409A
to the extent applicable)
 a lump sum equal to 30 months&rsquo; annual base salary; (iii) bonuses owing under the Employment Agreement
for the two-year period after the date of termination (net of any bonus amounts paid as Accrued Obligations) based on actual results
for the applicable quarters and fiscal years; and (iv) within 12 months following such termination (or on the earliest later date
as may be required by Internal Revenue Code Section 409A to the extent applicable)
 a lump sum equal to 30 months&rsquo; annual
 that if Mr. Hawatmeh is terminated without cause in contemplation of
 or within one year
 after a
change in control
 then two times such annual base salary and bonus payment amounts.

Under
a previous agreement with the holder of an outstanding secured convertible debenture
 all cash amounts payable to Mr. Hawatmeh
in excess of an aggregate of $120
000 per year are accrued and will not be paid until the secured convertible debenture is paid
or converted to common stock.


    
    


During
the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 we accrued for 6
000
000 stock options relating to this employment agreement. The
fair market value of the options issued during the year ended December 31
 2018 was $600
 using the following assumptions: estimated
seven-year term
 estimated volatility of 567%
 and a risk-free rate between 2.38%. The fair market value of the options was $600
using the following assumptions: estimated seven-year term
 estimated volatility of 567%
 and a risk-free rate of 2.46%. Mr. Hawatmeh

During
    the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 we did not issue stock options to the named executive officer due to the limited
    number of available shares under the employee incentive plan. These options have been earned by our named executive officer
    and we have accrued the stock option expense in the respective periods. These stock options can be issued upon the discretion
    of the board of directors based upon the number of available shares of the 2012 Stock Option Plan.


Director
Compensation

Except
for Iehab Hawatmeh
 who is also our chief executive officer
 we pay our directors $5

Board
Committees

We
do not currently have any committees of the board of directors. Additionally
 due to the nature of our intended
business
 the board of directors does not foresee a need for any committees in the foreseeable future.

Exchange (&ldquo;NYSE&rdquo;) and American Stock Exchange (&ldquo;Amex&rdquo;).

 we evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible&#13;impairment.

 we determined the underlying common stock of the instruments being accounted for&#13;as derivative liabilities had no value. As a result
 the fair value of the derivative liabilities as of the date our common stock&#13;was no longer available to trade was written off to additional paid-in capital in accordance with ASC 815-15-35-4. During the year&#13;ended December 31

 service providers
 and others&#13;have asserted legal claims in previous years. These creditors generally are not actively seeking collection of amounts due them
&#13;and we have determined that the probability of realizing any loss on these claims is remote and will seek to compromise and settle&#13;at a deep discount any of such claims that are asserted for collection. These amounts are included in our current liabilities.&#13;We have not accrued any liability for claims or judgments that we have determined to be barred by the applicable statute of limitations

 we obtained a judgment in&#13;the amount of $287

 Play Beverages
 LLC
 filed suit&#13;against Playboy Enterprises
 Inc.
 in Cook County
 Illinois
 Circuit Court in October 2012 asserting numerous claims
 including&#13;breach of contract and tortious interference. Playboy responded with a counterclaim of breach of contract and trademark infringement.&#13;After proceedings in October 2016
 the court awarded a judgment to Playboy of $6.6 million against Play Beverages and us. The court&#13;denied our motion for a new trial and awarded Playboy treble patent infringement damages and attorney&amp;#8217;s fees. We filed a&#13;notice of appeal in July 2017 and again in March 2018. Playboy has initiated collection efforts but has recovered no funds. We&#13;have accrued $17

599 as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 related to this judgment
 which is included in liabilities from discontinued&#13;operations (see &lt;i&gt;Note 14 &amp;#8211; Discontinued Operations&lt;/i&gt;). In September 2018

 and we counterclaimed against it. On November 2
 2011
 the court issued an injunction&#13;against Redi FZE prohibiting it from selling and distributing Playboy-branded products in conjunction with its distribution agreement&#13;with us. On August 16
 2012
 Redi FZE withdrew the suit

 RDS Touring and Promotions
&#13;Inc. was awarded a default judgment of $118

935 included in liabilities&#13;from discontinued operations as of December 31

 Jimmy Esebag was awarded a judgment&#13;against us for breach of contract. A judgment debtor examination of an affiliate took place in October 2013

&#13;we entered into a formal forbearance agreement with ABS
 dated as of March 1

&#13;whereby ABS agreed to take no further judgment enforcement actions in consideration of our payment of $25

 satisfaction&#13;of applicable conditions precedent
 return of the trademarks and intellectual property previously conveyed by ABS to us
 and our&#13;obligation to pay $1
835
000 secured by an encumbrance on all of our assets
 subject and subordinate to the prior lien and encumbrance&#13;in favor of YA Global. In addition
 we stipulated to an additional judgment for attorney&amp;#8217;s fees incurred in negotiating the&#13;ABS Forbearance Agreement and related post-judgment collection efforts. The ABS Forbearance Agreement also provided that our obligation&#13;would be reduced by the greater of the amount of credit granted in the bankruptcy proceedings for the value of the intellectual&#13;property we previously conveyed to ABS and the amount received by ABS from the sale of such intellectual property to a third party&#13;during the term of the ABS Forbearance Agreement
 plus the amount of any distribution to which we are entitled as a creditor of&#13;ABS

 ABS sent&#13;us a notice of default under the ABS Forbearance Agreement. Although there were some negotiations between us and ABS following&#13;the notice of default

 and us and our affiliates

 ABS is unable to presently take&#13;any steps to enforce its judgment. If that changes

 Interest

&#13;the IRS accepted our amended offer in compromise (the &amp;#8220;Offer&amp;#8221;) to settle delinquent payroll taxes
 interest
 and penalties
&#13;which requires us to pay $500
000
 remain current in our payment of taxes for five years
 and forego claiming any net operating&#13;losses for the years 2001 through 2015 or until we pay taxes on future profits in an amount equal to the taxes of $1
455
767 waived&#13;by the Offer. In June 2013
 we entered into a partial installment agreement to pay $768
526 in unpaid 2009 payroll taxes
 which&#13;requires us to pay the IRS 5% of cash deposits. The monthly payments are to continue until the account balances are paid in full&#13;or until the collection statute of limitation expires on October 6
 2020. There was $424
158 and $367
617 due as of December 31
&#13;2018 and 2017
 of which $122
222 and $108

&#13;our president and chief executive officer
 through an employment agreement entered in August 2009 and amended in September 2017
&#13;with a salary in an amount and commencement date to be determined. In July 2017
 Mr. Hawatmeh resigned all positions with us to&#13;pursue other business activities
 thereby effectively terminating the agreement. However
 in September 2017
 we reinstated Mr.&#13;Hawatmeh to his previous positions and reinstated his employment agreement. Among other things
 the reinstated employment agreement:&#13;(a) grants options to purchase a minimum of 6
000
000 shares of our stock each year
 with an exercise price equal to the market&#13;price of our common stock as of the grant date
 for the maximum term allowed under our stock option plan; (b) provides for health&#13;insurance coverage
 cell phone
 car allowance
 life insurance
 and director and officer liability insurance
 as well as any other&#13;bonus approved by our board; and (c) includes additional incentive compensation as follows: (i) a quarterly bonus equal to 5% of&#13;our earnings before interest
 taxes
 depreciation and amortization for the applicable quarter; (ii) bonuses equal to 1% of the&#13;net purchase price of any acquisitions we complete that are directly generated and arranged by Mr. Hawatmeh; and (iii) an annual&#13;bonus (payable quarterly) equal to 1% of our gross sales of all products

 we have verbal contracts with our employees that require payment of noncash compensation in a fixed&#13;number of shares. During the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 we did not grant options to purchase shares of common stock&#13;to employees due to the insufficient common shares available. We recorded expenses totaling $480 and $1
340 during the years ended&#13;December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively

 we entered into certain agreements&#13;(collectively
 the &amp;#8220;Agreements&amp;#8221;) to reduce our costs with Katana Electronics
 LLC
 a Utah limited liability company&#13;(&amp;#8220;Katana&amp;#8221;). The Agreements include an Assignment and Assumption Agreement
 an Equipment Lease
 and a Sublease Agreement&#13;relating to our property. Pursuant to the terms of the Sublease
 we agreed to sublease a certain portion of our premises to Katana
&#13;consisting of the warehouse and office space used as of the close of business on March 4
 2010. The term of the Sublease was for&#13;two months with automatic renewal periods of one month each. The base rent under the Sublease is $8
500 per month. The Sublease&#13;contains normal and customary use restrictions
 indemnification rights and obligations
 default provisions
 and termination rights.&#13;Under the Agreements signed
 we continue to have rights to operate as a contract manufacturer in the future in the U.S. and offshore.&#13;On July 1
 2011
 Katana had assumed the full lease payment
 and we agreed to pay Katana $5
000 per month on a month to month basis&#13;for the use of office space and utilities. We had no sublease income for the years ended December 31
 2018 or 2017. We recorded&#13;rent expense of $42
000 and $57
000 for the years ended December 31

 would have a material effect on the financial statements for the years ended December 31

 2018 and 2017
&amp;#160;we&amp;#160;had net operating loss carryforwards for tax reporting purposes of approximately $41.5 and $41.2&#13;million. These net operating loss carryforwards
 if unused
 begin to expire in 2020. Utilization of approximately $1.2 million&#13;of the total net operating loss is dependent on the future profitable operation of Racore Network
 Inc.
 a wholly owned subsidiary
&#13;under the separate return limitation rules and restrictions on utilizing net operating loss carryforwards after a change in ownership.&#13;In addition
 the realization of tax benefits relating to net operating loss carryforwards is limited due to the settlement related&#13;to amounts previously due to the IRS

we are the primary beneficiary. We account for our investments in common stock of other companies that we do not control

which we can exert significant influence using the cost method.

statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
 management is required
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
 the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported
periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 the
for revenue recognition. Adoption of ASC 606 did not have a significant impact on our financial statements. We recognize revenue
upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to
be received in exchange for those products or services. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected
from customers
 which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.

consists of an investment in a private digital multi-media technology company that totaled $300
000 at December 31
 2018 and 2017.
As we owned less than 20% of that company&#8217;s stock as of each date
 and no significant influence or control exists
 the investment
is accounted for using the cost method. We evaluated the investment for impairment and determined there was none during the periods
presented.




associated with the design and development of molds and dies for our contract-manufacturing segment. These costs are held as deposits
on the balance sheet until the molds or dies are finished and ready for use. At that point
 the costs are included as part of production
equipment in property and equipment and are amortized over their useful lives. We hold title to all molds and dies used in the
manufacture of products. The capitalized cost

 associated with molds and dies included in property
and equipment at December 31
 2018 and 2017
 was$12

 respectively.


is recognized in amounts equal to the cost of depreciable assets over estimated service lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized
over the shorter of the life of the lease or the service life of the improvements. The straight-line method of depreciation and
amortization is followed for financial reporting purposes. Maintenance
 repairs
 and renewals
 which neither materially add to
the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred. Gains or losses on dispositions
of property and equipment are included in operating results.

Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets


assets
 including intangibles
 for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset
may not be recoverable. At each balance sheet date
 we evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible
impairment. We use an estimate of future undiscounted net cash flows from the related asset or group of assets over their remaining
life in measuring whether the assets are recoverable. We did not record expenses for the impairment of long-lived assets during
the year ended December 31
 2018 or 2017.

Financial Instruments
with Derivative Features


issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. However
 we have financial instruments that are considered derivatives or contain
embedded features subject to derivative accounting. Embedded derivatives are valued separately from the host instrument and are
recognized as derivative liabilities in our balance sheet. We measure these instruments at their estimated fair value and recognize
changes in their estimated fair value in results of operations during the period of change. We have estimated the fair value of
these embedded derivatives using a Multi-NomialLattis model. The fair values of the derivative instruments are measured each reporting
period.


December 31
 2017
 our common stock was suspended from trading. Because of this
 the convertible note no longer met the criteria
to bifurcate the instrument under Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standard Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;)
815
. As such
 we determined the underlying common stock of the instruments being accounted for
as derivative liabilities had no value. As a result
 the fair value of the derivative liabilities as of the date our common stock
was no longer available to trade was written off to additional paid-in capital in accordance with ASC 815-15-35-4. During the year
ended December 31
 2018
 we became current with its filing requirements with the SEC. However
 we have not yet received clearance
from FINRA for our stock to resume trading. As such
 we determined the underlying common stock of the debt instruments had no value
as of December 31
 2018.




stock options to directors and employees
.
We account for our stock options in accordance with ASC 718-10
 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
 which requires the recognition
of the cost of employee services received in exchanged for an award of equity instruments in the financial statements and is measured
based on the grant date fair value of the award. ASC 718-10 also requires the stock option compensation expense to be recognized
over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (typically the vesting period).


compensation was $480 and $1
340 for the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.




method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets
 liabilities
 the carry forward of operating losses and tax
credits
 and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
An allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will not be realized.
Research tax credits are recognized as used.

Concentrations
of Risk


December 31
 2017
 we generated revenues totaling $12
500 which were from one customer. There were no revenues during the year
ended December 31
 2018.

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments


reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for cash
 notes payable
 and accounts payable approximate fair values
because of the immediate or short-term maturities of these financial instruments. The carrying amounts of our debt obligations
approximate fair value.



and Scope Exceptions
 defines fair value
 thereby eliminating inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting
pronouncements
 and increases disclosures surrounding fair value calculations. ASC 820-10-15 establishes a three-tiered fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used in fair value calculations. The three levels of inputs are defined
as follows:


assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.


assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
 such
as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets
with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs
are observable or can be derived principally from
 or corroborated by
 observable market data.


assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement
of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.


have fair values that approximate the carrying value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.




(EPS) is calculated by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
during each period. Diluted EPS is similarly calculated
 except that the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding would
include common shares that may be issued subject to existing rights with dilutive potential when applicable. We did not have any
potentially issuable common shares at December 31
 2018 and 2017.




advances with various individuals. These advances are due upon demand
 carry no interest
 and are not collateralized. These advances
are classified as short-term liabilities.

until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.

Litigation and
Claims


 service providers
 and others
have asserted legal claims in previous years. These creditors generally are not actively seeking collection of amounts due them
and we have determined that the probability of realizing any loss on these claims is remote and will seek to compromise and settle
at a deep discount any of such claims that are asserted for collection. These amounts are included in our current liabilities.
We have not accrued any liability for claims or judgments that we have determined to be barred by the applicable statute of limitations
which generally is eight years for judgments in Utah.




 we obtained a judgment in
the amount of $287
000 against Noble Gate Industrial
 a former authorized distributor of the Playboy-branded energy drink. We believe
the judgment is uncollectible and have not undertaken collection efforts in view of our analysis of the costs of collection as
compared to any likely recovery. No gain has been recorded for the periods presented.

Playboy Enterprises
Inc.


 Play Beverages
 LLC
 filed suit
against Playboy Enterprises
 Inc.
 in Cook County
 Illinois
 Circuit Court in October 2012 asserting numerous claims
 including
breach of contract and tortious interference. Playboy responded with a counterclaim of breach of contract and trademark infringement.
After proceedings in October 2016
 the court awarded a judgment to Playboy of $6.6 million against Play Beverages and us. The court
denied our motion for a new trial and awarded Playboy treble patent infringement damages and attorney&#8217;s fees. We filed a
notice of appeal in July 2017 and again in March 2018. Playboy has initiated collection efforts but has recovered no funds. We
have accrued $17

 the appellate court affirmed the judgment of
the circuit court.




 2011
 Redi
FZE sued us claiming alleged breach of contract
 and we counterclaimed against it. On November 2
 2011
 the court issued an injunction
against Redi FZE prohibiting it from selling and distributing Playboy-branded products in conjunction with its distribution agreement
with us. On August 16
 2012
 Redi FZE withdrew the suit
 and on October 30
 2012
 we were awarded a default judgment against Redi
in the amount of $1
225
155. We have not collected on this judgment and are weighing the cost of collection against the likelihood
of success. No gain or receivable has been recorded in the financial statements for the periods presented in connection with this
case.




 Old Dominion Freight Line
filed suit against us for unpaid freight services in the amount of $30
464 and was awarded a default judgment of $33
187 in March
2010. The amount due is included in accounts payable as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.




 RDS Touring and Promotions
Inc. was awarded a default judgment of $118
426 against us. In September 2012
 RDS domesticated the default judgment in the state
of Utah and sought to enforce the judgment against us. We have and will continue to resist the collection efforts by RDS. We had
recorded a loss equal to the judgment of $118
426
 of which $18
491 was previously paid leaving $99
935 included in liabilities
from discontinued operations as of December 31
 2018 and 2017.




 Jimmy Esebag was awarded a judgment
against us for breach of contract. A judgment debtor examination of an affiliate took place in October 2013
 and there have been
no further recovery efforts to date. We will continue to resist the collection efforts from this judgment. We had recorded a loss

in its bankruptcy case in the United States Bankruptcy Court. On March 17
 2009
 the bankruptcy court entered judgment in favor
of ABS and against us in the amount of $1

667
 plus interest. On September 11
 2009
 the bankruptcy court denied our motion
to set aside the judgment.

 hearings
appeals
 and mediation in 2011
 both parties were unable to resolve their outstanding issues.


 2012
we entered into a formal forbearance agreement with ABS
 dated as of March 1
 2012 (the &#8220;ABS Forbearance Agreement&#8221;)
whereby ABS agreed to take no further judgment enforcement actions in consideration of our payment of $25
000 upon execution
 satisfaction
of applicable conditions precedent
 return of the trademarks and intellectual property previously conveyed by ABS to us
 and our
obligation to pay $1
835
000 secured by an encumbrance on all of our assets
 subject and subordinate to the prior lien and encumbrance
in favor of YA Global. In addition
 we stipulated to an additional judgment for attorney&#8217;s fees incurred in negotiating the
ABS Forbearance Agreement and related post-judgment collection efforts. The ABS Forbearance Agreement also provided that our obligation
would be reduced by the greater of the amount of credit granted in the bankruptcy proceedings for the value of the intellectual
property we previously conveyed to ABS and the amount received by ABS from the sale of such intellectual property to a third party
during the term of the ABS Forbearance Agreement
 plus the amount of any distribution to which we are entitled as a creditor of
ABS
 subject to other limitations.


 ABS sent
us a notice of default under the ABS Forbearance Agreement. Although there were some negotiations between us and ABS following
the notice of default
 this matter has not been resolved.


judgment that had been remanded in the ABS bankruptcy proceedings to conclusively determine the amount of credit due us for the
conveyance of the intellectual property has been dismissed. All litigation and disputes between ABS and its affiliates
 on the
one hand
 and us and our affiliates
 on the other hand
 have been dismissed.


ABS our creditor claim against the estate of ABS
 to the extent of the balance due under the ABS Forbearance Agreement. Any distribution
from the ABS estate in excess of the adjusted amounts due under the ABS Forbearance Agreement will be paid to us.


lien is subordinate to liens on all of our assets in favor of Y.A. Global and/or Tekfine
 LLC
 ABS is unable to presently take
any steps to enforce its judgment. If that changes
 we would potentially face collection actions on the judgment
 subject to our
offset claims for the intellectual property and creditor claim.

 of which $45
000 has been paid leaving $45

 no additional amounts
have been accrued.

Delinquent Payroll

by the Offer. In June 2013
 we entered into a partial installment agreement to pay $768

our president and chief executive officer
 through an employment agreement entered in August 2009 and amended in September 2017
with a salary in an amount and commencement date to be determined. In July 2017
 Mr. Hawatmeh resigned all positions with us to
pursue other business activities
 thereby effectively terminating the agreement. However
 in September 2017
 we reinstated Mr.
Hawatmeh to his previous positions and reinstated his employment agreement. Among other things
 the reinstated employment agreement:
(a) grants options to purchase a minimum of 6
000
000 shares of our stock each year
 with an exercise price equal to the market
price of our common stock as of the grant date
 for the maximum term allowed under our stock option plan; (b) provides for health
insurance coverage
 cell phone
 car allowance
 life insurance
 and director and officer liability insurance
 as well as any other
bonus approved by our board; and (c) includes additional incentive compensation as follows: (i) a quarterly bonus equal to 5% of
our earnings before interest
 taxes
 depreciation and amortization for the applicable quarter; (ii) bonuses equal to 1% of the
net purchase price of any acquisitions we complete that are directly generated and arranged by Mr. Hawatmeh; and (iii) an annual
bonus (payable quarterly) equal to 1% of our gross sales of all products
 net of returns and allowances.


employment agreement above
 we have verbal contracts with our employees that require payment of noncash compensation in a fixed
number of shares. During the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 we did not grant options to purchase shares of common stock
to employees due to the insufficient common shares available. We recorded expenses totaling $480 and $1
340 during the years ended
December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively

11- INCOME TAXES


U.S. federal income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because we have experienced operating losses since
inception. When it is more likely than not that a tax asset cannot be realized through future income the&#160;company&#160;must
allow for this future tax benefit. We provided a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset
 consisting of net operating
loss carry forwards

to realize the deferred tax assets during the carry forward period.

 if challenged
 would have a material effect on the financial statements for the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017 applicable
under FASB ASC 740. We did not recognize any adjustment to the liability for uncertain tax position and therefore did not record
any adjustment to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit on the balance sheet. All&#160;of our&#160;tax returns remain open.

In addition

financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
 management is
required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
 the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported
periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.








(&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 606
 
the for revenue recognition. Adoption of ASC 606 did not have a significant impact on our financial statements. We recognize revenue
upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to
be received in exchange for those products or services. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected
from customers
 which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.








liquid
 short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We did not hold any cash
equivalents as of December 31
 2018 or 2017.








consists of an investment in a private digital multi-media technology company that totaled $300
000 at December 31
 2018 and 2017.
As we owned less than 20% of that company&#8217;s stock as of each date
 and no significant influence or control exists
 the investment
is accounted for using the cost method. We evaluated the investment for impairment and determined there was none during the periods
presented.








associated with the design and development of molds and dies for our contract-manufacturing segment. These costs are held as deposits
on the balance sheet until the molds or dies are finished and ready for use. At that point
 the costs are included as part of production
equipment in property and equipment and are amortized over their useful lives. We hold title to all molds and dies used in the
manufacture of products. The capitalized cost
 net of accumulated depreciation
 associated with molds and dies included in property
and equipment at December 31
 2018 and 2017
 was$12

 respectively.


is recognized in amounts equal to the cost of depreciable assets over estimated service lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized
over the shorter of the life of the lease or the service life of the improvements. The straight-line method of depreciation and
amortization is followed for financial reporting purposes. Maintenance
 repairs
 and renewals
 which neither materially add to
the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred. Gains or losses on dispositions
of property and equipment are included in operating results.





Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets


assets
 including intangibles
 for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset
may not be recoverable. At each balance sheet date
 we evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible
impairment. We use an estimate of future undiscounted net cash flows from the related asset or group of assets over their remaining
life in measuring whether the assets are recoverable. We did not record expenses for the impairment of long-lived assets during
the year ended December 31
 2018 or 2017.





Financial Instruments
with Derivative Features


issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. However
 we have financial instruments that are considered derivatives or contain
embedded features subject to derivative accounting. Embedded derivatives are valued separately from the host instrument and are
recognized as derivative liabilities in our balance sheet. We measure these instruments at their estimated fair value and recognize
changes in their estimated fair value in results of operations during the period of change. We have estimated the fair value of
these embedded derivatives using a Multi-NomialLattis model. The fair values of the derivative instruments are measured each reporting
period.


December 31
 2017
 our common stock was suspended from trading. Because of this
 the convertible note no longer met the criteria
to bifurcate the instrument under Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standard Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;)
815
. As such
 we determined the underlying common stock of the instruments being accounted for
as derivative liabilities had no value. As a result
 the fair value of the derivative liabilities as of the date our common stock
was no longer available to trade was written off to additional paid-in capital in accordance with ASC 815-15-35-4. During the
year ended December 31
 2018
 we became current with its filing requirements with the SEC. However
 we have not yet received clearance
from FINRA for our stock to resume trading. As such
 we determined the underlying common stock of the debt instruments had no
value as of December 31
 2018.








stock options to directors and employees
.
We account for our stock options in accordance with ASC 718-10
 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
 which requires the recognition
of the cost of employee services received in exchanged for an award of equity instruments in the financial statements and is measured
based on the grant date fair value of the award. ASC 718-10 also requires the stock option compensation expense to be recognized
over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (typically the vesting period).


compensation was $480 and $1
340 for the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.








method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets
 liabilities
 the carry forward of operating losses and tax
credits
 and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
An allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will not be realized.
Research tax credits are recognized as used.





Concentrations
of Risk


December 31
 2017
 we generated revenues totaling $12
500 which were from one customer. There were no revenues during the year
ended December 31
 2018.





Fair Value of Financial
Instruments


reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for cash
 notes payable
 and accounts payable approximate fair values
because of the immediate or short-term maturities of these financial instruments. The carrying amounts of our debt obligations
approximate fair value.



and Scope Exceptions
 defines fair value
 thereby eliminating inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting
pronouncements
 and increases disclosures surrounding fair value calculations. ASC 820-10-15 establishes a three-tiered fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used in fair value calculations. The three levels of inputs are defined
as follows:


assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.


assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
 such
as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets
with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs
are observable or can be derived principally from
 or corroborated by
 observable market data.


assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement
of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.


have fair values that approximate the carrying value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.








(EPS) is calculated by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
during each period. Diluted EPS is similarly calculated
 except that the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
would include common shares that may be issued subject to existing rights with dilutive potential when applicable. We did not
have any potentially issuable common shares at December 31
 2018 and 2017.








advances with various individuals. These advances are due upon demand
 carry no interest
 and are not collateralized. These advances
are classified as short-term liabilities.
