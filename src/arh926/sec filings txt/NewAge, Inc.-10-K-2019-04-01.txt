Business Overview




are a Colorado and Utah-based healthy beverages and lifestyles
company engaged in the development and commercialization of a
portfolio of organic
 natural and other better-for-you healthy
beverages
 liquid dietary supplements
 and other healthy lifestyle
products. We compete in the growth segments of the beverage
industry as a leading one-stop shop supplier for major retailers
and distributors. We also are one of few competitors that
commercializes its business across multiple channels including
traditional retail
 e-commerce
 direct to consumer
 and the medical
channel. We market a full portfolio of Ready-to-Drink
(&#x201C;RTD&#x201D;) better-for-you beverages including competitive
offerings in the kombucha
 tea
 coffee
 functional waters
relaxation drinks
 energy drinks
 rehydrating beverages
 and
functional medical beverage segments. We also offer liquid dietary
supplement products
 including Tahitian Noni&#xAE; Juice
 through a
direct-to-consumer model using independent distributors called
independent product consultants (&#x201C;IPCs&#x201D;). We
differentiate our brands through functional performance
characteristics and ingredients and offer products that are 100%
organic and natural
 with no high-fructose corn syrup
(&#x201C;HFCS&#x201D;)
 no genetically modified organisms
(&#x201C;GMOs&#x201D;)
 no preservatives
 and only natural flavors
fruits
 and ingredients. We rank as one of largest healthy beverage
companies in the world as well as one of the fastest growing
beverage companies according to Beverage Industry Magazine annual
rankings and Markets and Markets. Our goal is to become the
world&#x2019;s leading healthy beverage company
 with leading brands
for consumers
 leading growth for retailers and distributors
 and
leading return on investment for shareholders. Our target market is
health conscious consumers
 who are becoming more interested and
better educated on what is included in their diets
 causing them to
shift away from less healthy options such as carbonated soft drinks
or other high caloric beverages and towards alternative beverage
choices. We believe consumer awareness of the benefits of healthier
lifestyles and the availability of heathier beverages is rapidly
accelerating worldwide
 and we are capitalizing on that
shift.




Corporate History




Beverages Corporation was formed under the laws of the State of
Washington on April 26
 2010
 under the name American Brewing
Company
 Inc. (&#x201C;American Brewing&#x201D;).


&#xA0;


April 1
 2015
 American Brewing acquired the assets of B&amp;R
Liquid Adventure
 which included the brand
 Live Kombucha. Prior to acquiring
 Live
Kombucha brand and business
 we were a craft brewery operation. In
April 2016
 new management assumed daily operation of the business
and began the implementation of a new vision for the Company. In
May 2016 we changed our name to B&#xFA;cha


June 30
 2016
 we acquired the combined assets of
&#x201C;Xing&#x201D; including Xing Beverage
 LLC
 New Age Beverages
LLC
 Aspen Pure
 LLC
 and New Age Properties. We then shut down all
California operations where B&#xFA;cha was based
 relocated the
Company&#x2019;s operational headquarters to Denver
 Colorado and
changed our name to New Age Beverages Corporation.




October 2015
 we sold American Brewing
 including their brewery and
related assets
 to focus exclusively on healthy beverages. In
February 2017
 we uplisted onto The NASDAQ Capital Market. In March
2017
 we acquired the assets of Maverick Brands
 including their
brand Coco-Libre. In June 2017
 we acquired the assets of Premier
Micronutrient Corporation (&#x201C;PMC&#x201D;)
 and also completed
the acquisition of Marley Beverage Company (&#x201C;Marley&#x201D;)
including the brand licensing rights to all Marley brand ready to
drink beverages.




















December 21
 2018
 we completed a business combination with
Morinda
 whereby Morinda became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the

healthy lifestyles and beverage company founded in 1996 with
operations in more than 60 countries around the world
 and
manufacturing operations in Tahiti
 the U.S.
 China
 Japan
 and
Germany. Morinda was the first company to produce and sell products
derived from the noni plant
 an antioxidant-rich
 natural resource
found in French Polynesia that we believe sustains the well-being
of those who consume or use it. Morinda is primarily a
direct-to-consumer and e-commerce business and works with over
300
000 independent contractor IPCs worldwide. More than 70% of its
business is generated in the key Asia Pacific markets of Japan
China
 Korea
 Taiwan

Morinda provides a portfolio of healthy beverages
 with
multi-channel penetration spanning traditional retail
 e-commerce
and in-home
 and hybrid route-to-market spanning
direct-store-delivery (DSD)
 wholesale
 and
direct-to-consumer.

divisions. NABC Properties administers the New Age buildings
physical properties

additional direct-to-consumer sales channel and access to key
international markets.




Principal Products


&#xA0;

Our core business is to develop
 market
 sell
 and
distribute healthy liquid dietary supplements and ready-to-drink
beverages. The beverage industry comprises $1 trillion in annual


to four major multibillion-dollar multinationals that dominate the

Tahitian Noni Juice and MAX

original superfruit liquid dietary supplement. Sourced from the
noni fruit grown in French Polynesia
 we believe TNJ supports the
immune system

and allows for greater physical performance levels. Ancient
tradition and modern research both support the benefits of
noni.




Tahitian Noni Juice

healthy functioning of the body's systems.




Company is currently developing Noni +
cannabinoids&#xA0;(&#x201C;CBD&#x201D;) products with the intent to

B&#xFA;cha Live Kombucha




Live Kombucha (&#x201C;B&#xFA;cha&#x201D;) is a USDA-certified
organic
 natural
 non-GMO
 non-HFCS
 fermented Kombucha tea with
more than two billion colony forming units (&#x201C;CFUs&#x201D;) at
batching. B&#xFA;cha is produced with a unique and proprietary
manufacturing process that eliminates the common vinegary
aftertaste associated with many other Kombuchas and gives the
product a 12-month shelf life as compared to the typical 90-day
shelf life of our competitors&#x2019; products. The production
process makes B&#xFA;cha one of the world&#x2019;s first
shelf-stable (no refrigeration needed) kombuchas without
compromising efficacy
 and leads to consistency and stability with
no risk of secondary fermentation
 secondary alcohol production
incremental sugar production or over-carbonation.

New Age Health Sciences Division




Health Sciences Division owns 11 patents
 on which significant
cooperative research studies with human and animal trials have been
completed
 making New Age a beverage company with substantive
intellectual property. The patents and human need-states that are
addressed by the patent portfolio were all developed in partnership
with and funded by the U.S. government
 who invested more than $30
million behind them. Our intention is to convert the patents into
products
 with direct functionality in protection
 treatment
 or
improvement of different consumer need-states.




will pursue four main areas of focus where we believe we have the
most robust science and patent protection for the commercialization
of products including Rehydration/Recovery
 Radiation protection
Neural Protection/Improvement
 and Cardiovascular health. We also
intend to either license or outsource any patent we do not intend
to commercialize. The Company believes that the intellectual
property portfolio is of substantial value to either pharmaceutical
or beverage companies
 given the quality and uniqueness of the
patents
 and the science and evidence on the efficacy of the
technologies.

the United States
 whose compensation is variable and
performance-based. Each sales team member has individual targets
for increasing&#xA0;&#x201C;base&#x201D;&#xA0;volume through
distribution expansion
and&#xA0;&#x201C;incremental&#x201D;&#xA0;volume through promotions
and other in-store merchandising and display activity. As
distribution to new major customers
 new major channels
 or new
major markets increases
 we will expand the sales and marketing
team on a variable basis.




use a direct selling model to market our Tahitian Noni and TeMana
products through 300
000 IPCs in over 60 countries around the
world. Morinda associates in the United States and 25 other
countries motivate
 educate
 and assist IPCs in their
efforts.




Distribution&#xA0;


&#xA0;


products are currently distributed in over 60 countries
internationally
 and in 50 states domestically through a hybrid of
four routes to market including our own DSD system that reaches
more than 6
000 outlets
 and to more than 35
000 outlets throughout
the United States directly through customer&#x2019;s warehouses
through our network of DSD partners and through our network of
brokers and distributors. Our products are sold through multiple
channels including major grocery retail
 natural food retail
specialty outlets
 hypermarkets
 club stores
 pharmacies
convenience stores and gas stations&#x2014;and also direct to
consumers through individual independent distributor IPCs and
E-commerce.


&#xA0;


sales strategy is to distribute our products worldwide to consumers
in the most cost-effective manner possible. We sell our products
direct to consumers through our own E-commerce system and other
E-commerce systems
 through retail customers across grocery
 gas
convenience
 pharmacy
 mass
 club and other channels
 to major
foodservice customers
 to alternative channel customers including
juice/smoothie shops
 military
 office
 and health club
 and
through hospitals
 outpatient doctor offices
 and other
channels.




diversification of our channels and distributors
 similar to the
diversification of our retail customer base
 is expected to
minimize distributor and channel concentration and risk
 but is
also expected to have a very positive margin mix effect
 and a very
positive incremental volume impact.





Tahitian Noni
 TruAge
 TeMana
 and Other
Products




Independent Product Consultants (&#x201C;IPCs&#x201D;)




wish to sell Morinda&#x2019;s Tahitian Noni
 TruAge
 and
TeMana-branded products through our person-to-person sales model
must enroll in our independent sales force as an IPC. New IPCs are
sponsored by an existing IPC
 and the new IPC becomes a member of
the sponsoring IPC&#x2019;s sales organization. The newly enrolled
IPCs must sign a written agreement or accept the terms and
conditions of the agreement online at the Company&#x2019;s website.
The agreement includes that IPCs will comply with the
Company&#x2019;s policies and procedures
 which include that IPCs
will (i) safeguard and protect the reputation of the Company and
its products; (ii) refrain from any deceptive
 false
 unethical
 or
unlawful consumer or recruiting practices; (iii) refrain from any
deceptive
 false
 unethical
 or unlawful claims about the
Company&#x2019;s products or compensation plan; and (iv) refrain
from promoting or selling products that are competitive to the
Company&#x2019;s flagship product
 or promoting other network
marketing opportunities to IPCs whom they did not personally
sponsor with the Company. The Company may take disciplinary action
up to and including termination of the IPC&#x2019;s purchase and
sales organization rights
 against any IPC who violates its
policies and procedures. In most markets
 IPCs are required to
purchase a starter kit which includes sales and educational
materials. No commissions are paid on the purchase of a starter
kit. Our policies and procedures manual is available to IPCs in
this kit or is available online at the Company&#x2019;s website. We
sell these kits at a nominal price averaging $35. No other
investment is required to become an IPC.




enrolling as an IPC
 the IPC may purchase products directly from us
at wholesale (member) pricing for personal use and for resale to
customers. IPCs may build sales organizations by recruiting and
enrolling new IPCs. As new IPCs sponsor new IPCs
 levels are
created in the IPC&#x2019;s organizational structure called a
down-line. As these new IPCs continue to sponsor
 they create their
own sales organization which also forms a part of the sales
organization of the original sponsoring IPC. We have no
requirements for IPCs to recruit or sponsor new IPCs
 and IPCs are
not compensated for recruiting or sponsoring IPCs. IPC compensation
is based on product sales. Subject to payment of a nominal annual
renewal fee (which can be substituted by the sale of Morinda
product through the IPC&#x2019;s account at the time of renewal)
IPCs may continue to purchase our products at member pricing and
recruit a sales organization provided they comply with our policies
and procedures.



















Company&#x2019;s business and compensation plan for China is
executed in a modified form due to Chinese law and regulations.
Individuals who are residents of China and are eligible to work in
China may enroll as IPCs or as Customers in China. The same
policies and procedures described above
 as modified for China
apply to IPCs in China. According to Chinese regulations
 non-China
resident IPCs are not permitted to sponsor in China or otherwise
participate in the compensation plan for China.




IPC Training and Motivation




IPC&#x2019;s sponsor provides the initial training about our
products and compensation plan. Other IPCs in the sponsor&#x2019;s
sales organization typically assist with this training. The
Company&#x2019;s policies require that a sponsor must maintain an
ongoing professional leadership association with IPCs in their
sales organization. We develop training materials and sales tools
to assist IPCs with this training and in building their sales
organizations. We also conduct online trainings and webinars
regional
 national
 and international IPC events
 as well as
intensive leadership training events. Attendance at these events is
voluntary
 and IPCs may attend the events that they feel will most
benefit them and their sales organization. We have found that the
most successful and productive IPCs tend to be those who take
advantage of these events. While Morinda associates work to support
the IPCs and to provide them with training materials and sales
tools
 we rely on our IPCs to operate as the sales force for
Morinda
 and to sell our products
 recruit new IPCs and Customers
to purchase our products
 and to train new IPCs regarding our
products and compensation plan.




IPC Compensation




compensation plan has several attractive features and provides
several opportunities for IPCs to earn compensation. IPCs
understand that success comes from the effort
 dedication
resources
 and time they commit to their business. The compensation
opportunities require that IPCs consistently work at building
training
 and retaining their sales organizations to sell Morinda
products to consumers. Each compensation opportunity is designed to
reward dedicated IPCs for directly and indirectly generating
product sales through their sales organization and to consumers.
All compensation is conditioned on the IPC&#x2019;s good standing
and compliance with the Company&#x2019;s policies and procedures and
the laws of the country where the IPC does business




may build their sales organization by sponsoring new IPCs and
Customers in any market where the Company has registered and sells
its products. Additionally
 the integration of our compensation
plan across all markets (except China) allows IPCs to earn
commissions from global product sales along with local product
sales. We believe our compensation plan is one of the most
attractive and lucrative offered by any direct selling
company&#x2014;and is thus a significant aspect of our ability to
expand internationally.




Customers




also has a Customer program. Individuals may enroll as Customers
and purchase products for their personal use only. Customers are
not permitted to resell or distribute our products. The Customer
program allows us to include individuals who wish to use
Morinda&#x2019;s products but who do not wish to participate in the
business. Customers are not eligible to earn commissions. Customers
may upgrade their account at any time to become an IPC and may then
participate in the business and compensation plan and be eligible
to earn commissions.




Manufacturing and Distribution of Noni-Based Products




manufacturing and bottling facilities are in Rongchang
 China;
Tokyo
 Japan; 
 Germany;
Ho Chi Minh City
 Vietnam; Alamosa
 Colorado; American Fork
 Utah
and in 10 other contract manufacturing facilities throughout the
US. Each of our products are produced to exacting specifications
and standards
 and subject to strict quality control
procedures.




Coco-libre brand of coconut water is sourced from young coconuts on
the southeastern coast of the country
 which we believe produces
the sweetest and most complex flavored coconut water of any major
competitor. Xing
 B&#xFA;cha
 and Marley products are produced
using our proprietary blends and production processes.




noni fruit is harvested from noni trees on 18 islands of French
Polynesia by approximately 2
000 harvesters
 who are independent
contractors
 and who work with Company representatives on each
island. All fruit is checked at the time of harvest for quality
maturity
 and purity. To date
 we have maintained good relations
with our suppliers and have not experienced any significant
difficulties in obtaining adequate supplies of the noni
fruit.





















noni fruit is then shipped to our&#xA0;&#xA0; 85
000 square foot
processing plant in Mataiea
 Tahiti
 where the fruit is again
checked before being processed. This facility
 as well as all
facilities that produce products for us
 adheres to the Good
Manufacturing Practices as established by the FDA. The Tahiti
facility is well-maintained
 and the buildings and equipment are
kept clean and in good repair. Technology is up-to-date. The
facility is regularly inspected by the French Polynesian
authorities and by the United States FDA.




processing facility
 the seeds are separated from the fruit. The
seeds are later prepared for oil extraction. The fruit is
extensively inspected
 pasteurized
 and turned into puree
 which is
the key component of our Tahitian Noni Juice. The pasteurized puree
is checked for quality and placed into tote bins
&#xA0; which are
shipped by sea to a West Coast port of the United States
 Japan
China or Germany for use in manufacturing our products. Each day
the equipment used at this facility is automatically cleaned by a
three step&#xA0; Clean-in-Place (CIP) system. This system ensures
the cleanliness of the equipment
 tanks
 and pipes used in the
processing of the puree.




Reliance on Third-Party Suppliers and Distributors




as noted in the previous section
 we rely on various suppliers for
the raw and packaging materials
 production
 sale
 and distribution
of our products. Our third-party distribution providers are for
certain areas of the country that are outside of our owned DSD
distribution network. The material terms of these relationships are
typically negotiated annually and include pricing
 quality
standards
 delivery times and conditions
 purchase orders
 and
payment terms. Payment terms are typically net 30
 meaning that the
total invoiced amount is expected to be paid in full within 30 days
from the date the products or services are provided. We believe
that we have sufficient options for each of our raw and packaging
material needs
 as well as our third-party distribution needs and
also have long-term relationships with each of our suppliers and
distributors
 resulting in consistency in quality and supply. We
also believe that we have sufficient breadth of retail
relationships with distribution in both large and small retailers
and independents and across multiple channels (mass
 club
pharmacies
 convenience
 and small and large format retailers)
throughout the United States.




contractual arrangements with all third parties
 including
suppliers
 manufacturers
 distributors
 and retailers are typical
of the beverage industry with standard terms. We have no long-term
obligations with any of the third parties nor do any of them have
long-term obligations with us. The third-party supplier
manufacturing and distribution agreements were entered into in the
normal course of business within the guidelines of industry
practices and are not deemed material and definite.




Competition




beverage industry
 specifically the healthy beverage industry
 and
the direct selling industries are multi-billion dollar industries
which are highly competitive. We face intense competition from very
large
 international corporations
 as well as from local and
national companies. In addition
 we face competition from
well-known companies that have large market share. We also face
stiff competition for the services of our IPCs that sell our
direct-to-consumer products.


&#xA0;


intensity of competition in the future is expected to increase
 and
no assurance can be provided that we can sustain our market
position or expand our business.


&#xA0;


of our current and potential competitors are well established and
have longer operating histories
 significantly greater financial
and operational resources
 and name recognition than we have.
However
 we believe that
 with our diverse product line
 consisting
of noni juice
 kombucha tea
 green tea
 water
 energy beverages
and new CBD-infused beverages
 we will have the ability to obtain a
large market share
 and continue to generate sales and compete in
the industry.




Competitive Strengths




has five components of differentiation that distinguishes it from
other companies:







New Age has a full
brand portfolio of healthy beverage and lifestyle products. The
company&#x2019;s beverages compete in only the growth segments of
the industry
 and as such is the only one-stop-shop supplier of
healthy beverages for retailers and distributors. These entities
are reticent to work with smaller
 individual brand companies
without the resources and infrastructure to support
them.





















Age&#x2019;s portfolio of healthy brands fills a long-felt unmet
need for consumers
 retailers and distributors created by the
legacy leaders in the industry. The Company enjoys the growth rate
benefits of the segments in which it competes by focusing
exclusively on healthy alternatives
 and unlike major competitors
has limited distractions like those required investments to
maintain businesses in declining segments like carbonated soft
drinks for example.






New Age has a
unique
 omni-channel distribution and sales model
 with its own
direct-to consumer selling system
 its own direct-to-store
distribution system
 an e-commerce business and dedicated
e-commerce fulfillment system
 and a medical channel and other
alternative channel distribution system as part of its go to market
strategy. New Age&#x2019;s
 direct-to consumer system reaches over
300
000 independent distributors in more than 60
countries






Age&#x2019;s direct-to-store distribution platform includes almost
40 unique routes
 with an almost 100-person strong sales and
merchandising team
 covering more than 6
000 outlets for more than
60 partner brands and more than 600 SKU&#x2019;s. Beyond New Age own
direct-to-store system
 the company has strong distribution in
major key accounts across the U.S covering more than 300
000 points
of distribution. New Age has a robust national hybrid distribution
network with other major DSD operators
 natural channel
distributors
 and direct to store wholesale distribution. The
Company&#x2019;s national network represents a significant
competitive advantage and barrier to entry vs. many other smaller
beverage companies.




Age&#x2019;s e-commerce and pick-pack-ship fulfillment centers
fulfills auto shipments monthly to more than 120
000 customers and
exceeds $150 million in annual revenue. We believe it is one of the
largest beverage e-commerce systems in existence and provides for a
high-margin way to directly market to its consumers and build its
database of insights and purchase behavior.




believe that each of our distribution and channel execution models
are highly leverageable and under-developed
 with significant
growth to be obtained utilizing our infrastructure across 60
international markets
 significant growth to be gained from
expanding our subscribers and breadth of portfolio in our
e-commerce system
 significant growth from expanding our core
brands in traditional national retail within the US
 and
significant growth in expanding our Health Sciences and other
products to the Medical and other alternative
channels.






New Age has a
portfolio of patents and intellectual property that we believe will
be the future of the beverage industry. Beyond the patent
protection
 the company also has the cooperative research studies
and human trials on many of its unique products. The science and
products
 many of which were developed either by or in conduction
with the US government and US military
 cover many fundamental
human need states including cardiovascular health
 neural
protection
 and radiation and environmental protection. We believe
that as we commercialize this portfolio and convert these patents
into products
 that the functional benefit and differentiation of
these products will create a significant new market for the Company
and bridge the gap between pharma-grade medicine
 nutraceuticals
and the beverage industry.






of its Health Sciences Division
 the company has developed a
portfolio of cannabis-infused beverages. These cannabis-infused
beverages have undergone significant consumer testing to optimize
flavor
 profile
 dosage and efficacy. Through its strategic
partnership with Privateer
 we believe we have the regulatory
legal
 and production insights together with the relationships and
the Marley brand
 that position the company to be the leader in
this fast-emerging segment. New Age has been working closely with
major retailers in the US and in key international markets to
launch its portfolio as soon as the regulatory and legal landscape
in respective geographies permit.






We believe the
Company has financial flexibility with a strong balance sheet and
access to the capital markets unlike many other smaller beverage
entities. The company&#x2019;s low relative debt
 profitability
facilitated by its unique omni-channel structure
 and positioning
in the public markets enable the company to access growth capital
at a lower relative cost
 and access growth capital to take
advantage of major opportunities it uncovers across its core
businesses.







We have the
organizational capabilities and systems unlike many other beverage
companies
 with the people
 processes
 systems
 information
 and
culture/environment to drive superior
 sustainable
 profitable
growth.





















Age&#x2019;s senior leadership team and board of directors
collectively have depth of industry experience and insight in
leading highly successful. multi-billion-dollar multinational
companies. The Company&#x2019;s Board of Directors brings global
strategic leadership experience gleaned from running highly
successful major multinational companies in the beverage
 retail
and other industries. From a process standpoint
 New Age has
dedicated daily
 weekly
 monthly and annual routines
 by and
through which it runs the operation.




Company has an internal target setting system whereby associate in
the firm have specific metrics cascaded from the Company&#x2019;s
annual business plan. New Age has also developed its own
proprietary dashboards to augment its access to syndicated data and
industry information
 and has employed a culture of ownership and
environment of accountability throughout the company.




result of the Company&#x2019;s strengths
 we believe these
competitive advantages position New Age to drive superior growth
and profitability versus other competitors in its
industry.&#xA0;




Our Growth Strategy




long-term objective is to become the leading healthy beverages and
lifestyles company. We believe that we have all of the necessary
components and capabilities to accomplish that mission. We intend
to achieve our goal by driving organic growth behind our existing
portfolio of healthy functional beverages and lifestyle products
in all relevant packages and product formats
 across all major
retail
 direct-to-consumer
 and other channels
 in all major
markets
 through an aligned network of retailer and distributor
partners.




strategies include the following:






Expand core brands
in focus markets of US
 China
 and Japan






Develop
omni-channel distribution system (Retail
 Direct
 E-Commerce
Medical) worldwide






Gain-first
mover advantage -globally with cannabinoid-infused
products






Expand New Age
brands and Health Sciences products in new markets
globally






Drive
brand awareness with expanded consumer marketing across all
mediums






Deliver
superior profitability and return on investment through capture of
synergies and leverage of its global infrastructure and operating
capabilities






Research and Development Activities


&#xA0;


research and development efforts are focused on two primary paths.
The first is to continually review our existing formulas and
production processes and structure to evaluate opportunities for
cost of goods sold improvements
 without degrading the quality or
fundamentally changing the consumer appeal taste profile of our
existing products. The second major research and development effort
is in the development of fundamentally new and differentiated
products
 based on consumer insights and trends and competitive
intensity in those segments. The Company&#x2019;s mission to only
provide healthy functional beverages governs our development
efforts.


&#xA0;


Company&#x2019;s new products and R&amp;D efforts in its Health
Sciences Division are science-backed by the patents
 cooperative
research studies
 and human and animal trials acquired from the
Premier Micronutrient Corporation. They are targeted toward
fundamental human needs-states
 segments that do not yet exist in
beverages
 but do exist in the pharmaceutical arena
 and
opportunities where New Age can gain first mover advantage. The
Company&#x2019;s mission is to only provide healthy functional
beverages with real efficacy for consumers. That guiding principle
of&#xA0;&#x201C;no compromise&#x201D;&#xA0;governs all our
development efforts.




has an R&amp;D group that is closely aligned with and seamlessly
supports the goals and plans of the Company. In addition to
developing new healthy and scientifically sound products and
reviewing and improving existing formulas and processes for cost
reductions
 Morinda R&amp;D continues to conduct and publish new
cutting edge benefits research on noni and other new products in
order to maintain a distinct advantage in the healthy beverage and
skin care categories. Morinda R&amp;D is an integral part of the
global corporate structure providing timely technical
 regulatory
quality
 processing and scientific standards
 data
 and expertise
as needed and requested. Morinda R&amp;D
 in partnership with many
of its departments
 maintains an extensive intellectual property
database of patents
 publications
 formulations and ideas that help
protect and keep the Company in the forefront of healthy beverage
offerings and product development. Morinda R&amp;D administers
laboratories that provide analytical
 chemical
 microbiological
nutritional
 and biochemical capabilities that are both
standardized
 as well as
 on the cutting edge of knowledge. We own
the only lab in the world dedicated to the study of the noni plant
and pioneering new innovative applications for noni.




Working Capital Practices




maintain sufficient amounts of inventory in stock to provide a high
level of service to our customers with our key products.
Substantial inventories are required to fulfill our dual role as
manufacturer and distributor of some of our products. We also watch
seasonal markets and may purchase ahead of normal demand to hedge
against cost increases and supply risks.



















Employees




December 31
 2018
 we had 889 employees globally. We also engage
temporary employees and consultants as needed. We have not
experienced any work stoppages
 and we consider our relations with
our employees to be very good.

 including the
unauthorized use of our brand name

the use of a similar name by a competing company or a lawsuit
initiated either by us or against us for infringement upon
proprietary information or improper use of a trademark or patent
may affect our ability to create brand name recognition
 cause
customer confusion and/or have a detrimental effect on our business
due to the cost of defending any potential litigation related to

International Patent and Trademark Offices may be necessary in the
future to enforce our intellectual property rights
 to protect our
trade secrets and/or to determine the validity and scope of the

Government and Industry Regulation


&#xA0;


are subject to a variety of federal
 state and local laws and
regulations in the U.S. These laws and regulations apply to many
aspects of our business including the manufacture
 safety
labeling
 transportation
 advertising and sale of our products. The
U.S. FDA and FTC regulate the advertising and sale of our healthy
beverage products and skin care products. Violations of these laws
or regulations in the manufacture
 safety
 labeling
transportation
 and advertising of our products could damage our
reputation and/or result in regulatory actions with substantial
penalties. For example
 changes in recycling and bottle deposit
laws or special taxes on our beverages and our ingredients could
increase our costs. Regulatory focus on the health
 safety and
marketing of beverage products is increasing. Certain federal or
state regulations or laws affecting the labeling of our products
such as California&#x2019;s&#xA0;&#x201C;Prop 65
&#x201D;&#xA0;which
requires warnings on any product with substances that the state
lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects
 are or could
become applicable to our products. At this time
 our products do
not require government approval
 but as federal or state laws
change
 the manufacture or quality of our products may become
subject to additional regulation. CBD products will require
registration in certain states. Additionally
 existing and new
functional health products sold by Morinda can require registration
in some foreign markets.

 the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934
 as amended (the&#xA0;&#x201C;Exchange Act&#x201D;)

 and Utah Corporation Law. We will
also be subject to common business and tax rules and regulations
pertaining to the operation of our business
 such as the United
States Internal Revenue Tax Code and the Washington
 Colorado
 and
Utah State Tax Codes
 as well as international tax codes and
shipping tariffs. We will also be subject to proprietary
regulations such as United States Trademark and Patent Law as it
applies to the intellectual property of third parties. We believe
that the effects of existing or probable governmental regulations
will be additional responsibilities of management to ensure that we
are in compliance with securities regulations as they apply to our
products as well as ensuring that we do not infringe on any
proprietary rights of others with respect to our products. We will
also need to maintain accurate financial records in order to remain
compliant with securities regulations as well as any corporate tax
liability we incur.


&#xA0;


Seasonality


&#xA0;


experience some seasonality whereby the peak summer months show a
higher level of sales and consumption. However
 we believe that the
structure of our business and range of products in our portfolio
mitigate any major fluctuations. Our revenue during the second and
third quarters of the year have historically been approximately 60%
of annual revenue
 and this seasonality is expected to continue for
the foreseeable future.

Item 1A - Risk Factors




Our business
 financial condition
 results of operations and cash
flows are subject to a number of risk factors that may adversely
affect our business
 financial condition
 results of operations or
cash flows. If any significant adverse developments resulting from
these risk factors should occur
 the trading price of our
securities could decline
 and moreover
 investors in our securities
could lose all or part of their investment in our
securities.




You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and
limitations on forward-looking statements under &#x201C;Special Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.&#x201D; All forward-looking
statements made by us are qualified by the risk factors described
below.




Risks Related to our Business
 Operations
 and
Industry&#xA0;




We have incurred losses to date and may continue to incur
losses.


&#xA0;


incurred net losses since we commenced operations. For the years
ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 our net losses were $12.1 million
and $3.5 million
 respectively.&#xA0;




an accumulated deficit of $22.6 million as of December 31
 2018.
These losses have had
 and likely will continue to have
 an adverse
effect on our working capital
 assets
 and stockholders&#x2019;
equity. In order to achieve and sustain such revenue growth in the
future
 we must significantly expand our market presence and
revenues from existing and new customers. We may continue to incur
losses in the future and may never generate revenues sufficient to
become profitable or to sustain profitability. Continuing losses
may impair our ability to raise the additional capital required to
continue and expand our operations.




In connection with our combination with Morinda
 we potentially owe
the former Morinda shareholders up to $15 million in cash or
registered stock (plus interest) based on Morinda standalone 2019
results.




connection with the Morinda combination
 the Company issued 43
804
shares of Series D Preferred Stock providing for the potential
payment of up to $15 million to the former Morinda shareholders
contingent upon Morinda achieving certain post-closing milestones.
The holders of the preferred stock will be entitled to receive a
dividend of up to an aggregate of $15 million (the &#x201C;Milestone
Dividend&#x201D;) if the Adjusted EBITDA of Morinda standalone is at
least $20 million for the year ended December 31
 2019. The
Milestone Dividend is payable on April 15
 2020 (the
&#x201C;Dividend Payment Date&#x201D;). If the Adjusted EBITDA of
Morinda standalone is less than $20 million
 the Milestone Dividend
will be adjusted downward based on applying a five-times multiple
to the difference between the Adjusted EBITDA of $20 million and
actual Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31
 2019.
Additionally
 the Company is required to pay an annual dividend to
the holders of the Preferred Stock equal to an aggregate of 1.5% of
the Milestone Dividend amount
 payable on a pro rata basis. The
Company may pay the Milestone Dividend and/or the annual dividend
in cash or in kind
 provided that if the Company chooses to pay in
kind
 the shares of common stock issued as payment therefore must
be registered under the Securities Act of 1933
 as amended (the
&#x201C;Securities Act&#x201D;). The Preferred Stock will terminate
on the Dividend Payment Date.




We are an &#x201C;emerging growth company
&#x201D; and the reduced
disclosure requirements applicable to &#x201C;emerging growth
companies&#x201D; could make our common stock less attractive to
investors.


&#xA0;


an &#x201C;emerging growth company
&#x201D; as defined in the JOBS
Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company
 we may take
advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements
that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging
growth companies
 including
 but not limited to
 not being required
to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section
404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 reduced disclosure obligations
regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy
statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory
&#x201C;say-on-pay&#x201D; votes on executive compensation and
shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute
compensation.




addition
 Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an
emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An
emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain
accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to
private companies.




















remain an &#x201C;emerging growth company&#x201D; until the earliest
of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total
annual gross revenues of $1
000
000
000 or more; (ii) the last date
of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of
the first sale of common stock under this registration statement;
(iii) the date on which we have
 during the previous three-year
period
 issued more than $1
000
000
000 in non-convertible debt;
and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a &#x201C;large
accelerated filer&#x201D; under the Exchange Act. We will be deemed
a large accelerated filer on the first day of the fiscal year after
the market value of our common equity held by non-affiliates
exceeds $700
000
000
 measured on January 1.


&#xA0;


cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less
attractive to the extent we rely on the exemptions available to
emerging growth companies. If some investors find our common stock
less attractive as a result
 there may be a less active trading
market for our common stock and our stock price may be more
volatile.




Growth of operations will depend on the acceptance of our products
and consumer discretionary spending.


&#xA0;


acceptance of our healthy beverage products by both retailers to
gain distribution and by consumers to include in the beverage
consumption repertoire is critically important to our success.
Shifts in retailer priorities and shifts in user preferences away
from our products
 our inability to develop effective healthy
beverage products that appeal to both retailers and consumers
 or
changes in our products that eliminate items popular with some
consumers could harm our business. Also
 our success depends toa
significant extent on discretionary user spending
 which is
influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of
discretionary income. Accordingly
 we may experience an inability
to generate revenue during economic downturns or during periods of
uncertainty
 where users may decide to purchase beverage products
that are cheaper or to forego purchasing any type of healthy
beverage products
 due to a lack of available capital. Any material
decline in the amount of discretionary spending could have a
material adverse effect on our sales
 results of operations
business and financial condition.




We cannot be certain that the products that we offer will become
or continue to be
 appealing and as a result there may not be any
demand for these products and our sales could decrease
 which would
result in a loss of revenue. Additionally
 there is no guarantee
that interest in our products will continue
 which could adversely
affect our business and revenues.




for products which we sell depends on many factors
 including the
number of customers we are able to attract and retain over time
the competitive environment in the healthy beverage industry
 as
well as the beverage industry as a whole
 may force us to reduce
prices below our desired pricing level or increase promotional
spending
 and ability to anticipate changes in user preferences and
to meet consumer&#x2019;s needs in a timely cost effective manner
all could result in immediate and longer term declines in the
demand for the products we plan to offer
 which could adversely
affect our sales
 cash flows and overall financial condition. An
investor could lose his or her entire investment as a
result.


&#xA0;


We have limited management resources and are dependent on key
executives.


&#xA0;


currently relying on key individuals to continue our business and
operations and
 in particular
 the professional expertise and
services of Mr. Brent Willis
 Chief Executive Officer
 as well as
key members of our executive management team and others in key
management positions. In addition
 our future success depends in
large part on the continued service of Mr. Willis. We have entered
into an employment agreement with Mr. Willis
 but the existence of
an employment agreement does not guarantee retention ofMr. Willis
and we may not be able to retain Mr. Willis for the duration of or
beyond the end of his term. If our officers and directors chose not
to serve or if they are unable to perform their duties
 and we are
unable to retain a replacement qualified individual or individuals
this could have an adverse effect on our business operations
financial condition and operating results if we are unable to
replace the current officers and directors with other qualified
individuals.




The healthy beverage and lifestyle industry requires the attraction
and retention of talented employees.




in the beverage industry
 specifically as it relates to our healthy
functional beverage products
 does and will continue to require the
acquisition and retention of highly talented and experienced
individuals. Due to the growth in the market segment targeted
 such
individuals and the talent and experience they possess is in high
demand. There is no guarantee that we will be able to attract and
maintain access to such individuals. If we fail to attract
 train
motivate
 and retain talented personnel
 our business
 financial
condition
 and operating results may be materially and adversely
impacted
 which could result in the loss of your entire
investment.




















Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could
have a material adverse effect on our business.


&#xA0;


cannot provide reliable financial reports
 our operating results
could be harmed. All internal control systems
 no matter how well
designed
 have inherent limitations. Therefore
 even those systems
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance
with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Based on our evaluations
 our management concluded that there were
no material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting for the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
respectively. A material weakness is a deficiency
 or a combination
of control deficiencies
 in internal control over financial
reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a
material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Any failure to
implement required new or improved controls
 or difficulties
encountered in their implementation
 could harm our operating
results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.
Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control
environment could cause investors to lose confidence in our
reported financial information
 which could have a material adverse
effect on our stock price. Failure to comply with Section 404(a)
could also potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by
the SEC or other regulatory authorities.


&#xA0;


Competition that we face is varied and strong.




products and industry as a whole are subject to competition. There
is no guarantee that we can develop or sustain a market position or
expand our business. We anticipate that the intensity of
competition in the future will increase.




compete with a number of entities in providing products to our
customers. Such competitor entities include: (1) a variety of large
multinational corporations engaged in the beverage and healthy
beverage industries
 including but not limited to companies that
have established loyal customer bases over several decades; (2)
healthy beverage companies that have an established customer base
and have the same or a similar business plan as we do and may be
looking to expand nationwide; (3) a variety of other local and
national healthy beverage companies with which we either currently
or may
 in the future
 compete; and (4) multinational corporations
in the direct selling business that have a large
 loyal independent
distributor bases.




our current and potential competitors are well established and have
longer operating histories
 significantly greater financial and
operational resources
 and greater name and brand recognition than
we have. As a result
 these competitors may have greater
credibility with both existing and potential customers. They also
may be able to offer more products and more aggressively promote
and sell their products. Our competitors may also be able to
support more aggressive pricing than we will be able to
 which
could adversely affect sales
 cause us to decrease our prices to
remain competitive
 or otherwise reduce the overall gross profit
earned on our products.




In our direct-to-consumer business
 we sell our products to a
network of active IPCs and Customers. If we are unable to attract
and retain active IPCs and Customers
 our business may be
harmed.




distribute our Tahitian Noni
TruAge
 and TeMana products through
approximately 300
000 independent contractor IPCs
 and we depend
upon them directly for a substantial amount of our sales. To
increase our revenue
 we must increase the number of
 and the
productivity of
 our IPCs. Thus
 our success in this segment
depends in part upon our ability to attract
 retain
 and motivate a
large base of IPCs. We cannot accurately predict how the number and
productivity of our IPCs may fluctuate
 because we are relying
primarily on our IPC leaders to recruit
 train
 and motivate new
IPCs. Several related factors affect retention and motivation
including general business and economic conditions
 adverse
publicity
 investigations or legal proceedings
 government
regulations or actions
 public perceptions about dietary supplement
products
 and other competing direct-to-consumer companies that are
larger than us and compete fiercely for a limited number of persons
who desire to become independent distributors.




In our direct-to-consumer business
 Tahitian Noni Juice and MAX
constitute a significant portion of our sales.




and MAX constitute a significant portion of our Morinda business
unit sales
 accounting for 85%
 85%
 and 87% in 2018
 2017
 and
2016
 respectively. We face a high degree of competition from other
companies producing noni and other superfruit products. If consumer
demand for these products declines significantly or our competition
is more successful in the markets in which we do business
 then our
financial condition and operating results would be
harmed.



















We depend on a limited number of suppliers of raw and packaging
materials.




upon a limited number of suppliers for raw and packaging materials
used to make and package our products. Our success will depend in
part upon our ability to successfully secure such materials from
suppliers that are delivered with consistency and at a quality that
meets our requirements. The price and availability of these
materials are subject to market conditions. Increases in the price
of our products due to the increase in the cost of raw materials
could have a negative effect on our business.




are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of raw and packaging
materials
 delays or reductions in product shipments could occur
which would have a material adverse effect on our business
financial condition
 and results of operations. The supply and
price of raw materials used to produce our products can be affected
by a number of factors beyond our control
 such as frosts
droughts
 other weather conditions
 economic factors affecting
growing decisions
 various plant diseases and pests
 transportation
interruption and foreign imposed restrictions. If any of the
foregoing were to occur
 no assurance can be given that such
condition would not have a material adverse effect on our business
financial condition
 and results of operations. In addition
 our
results of operations are dependent upon our ability to accurately
forecast our requirements of raw materials. Any failure by us to
accurately forecast our demand for raw materials could result in an
inability to meet higher than anticipated demand for products or
producing excess inventory
 either of which may adversely affect
our results of operations.




direct-to-consumer business
 all the noni we use is grown and
harvested exclusively in French Polynesia. Noni fruit is the most
important raw material used in our Tahitian Noni and TeMana
products
 and it is important to the success of our Company. If the
government of French Polynesia were to prohibit the exportation or
use of noni
 or
 if we were unable to source noni fruit in French
Polynesia in sufficient quantities to meet demand for our products
due to adverse weather
 natural disasters
 soil overuse
 labor
shortages
 or any other reason
 our financial condition and results
would be harmed. Any adverse publicity regarding the quality of
noni grown in French Polynesia would also have an adverse impact on
our results and financial condition.




We depend heavily on our processing plant in Mataiea
Tahiti.




processing plant in Mataiea
 Tahiti produces all the noni puree
used in our Tahitian Noni Juice
 MAX
 and many other noni-based
products. Noni puree is sent to our Company-owned and contracted
manufacturing facilities in American Fork
 Utah
 Japan
 Germany
and China. As a result
 we are dependent upon the uninterrupted and
efficient operation of our processing plant in Mataiea
 Tahiti. The
Tahiti operation is subject to power failures
 the breakdown
failure
&#xA0; or substandard performance of equipment
 the
improper installation or operation of equipment
 natural or other
disasters
 labor strikes
 and the need to comply with the
requirements or directives of government agencies
 including the
FDA. The occurrence of these or any other operational problems at
our facility may have a material adverse effect on our business
financial condition
&#xA0; and results of operations.



We depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant
portion of our sales.




and beverage retailers across all channels in the U.S. and other
markets have been consolidating
 increasing margin demands of brand
suppliers
 and increasing their own private brand offerings
resulting in large
 sophisticated retailers with increased buying
power. They are in a better position to resist our price increases
and demand lower prices. They also have leverage to require us to
provide larger
 more tailored promotional and product delivery
programs. If we and our distributor partners do not successfully
provide appropriate marketing
 product
 packaging
 pricing and
service to these retailers
 our product availability
 sales and
margins could suffer. Certain retailers make up an important
percentage of our products&#x2019; retail volume
 including volume
sold by our distributor partners. Some retailers also offer their
own private label products that compete with some of our brands.
The loss of sales of any of our products by a major retailer could
have a material adverse effect on our business and financial
performance.


&#xA0;


We depend on third party manufacturers for a portion of our
business.




we own or control manufacturing facilities in French Polynesia
Utah
 and China
 a portion of our sales revenue is dependent on
third party manufacturers that we do not control. The majority of
these manufacturers&#x2019; business comes from producing and/or
selling either their own products or our competitors&#x2019;
products. As independent companies
 these manufacturers make their
own business decisions. They may have the right to determine
whether
 and to what extent
 they manufacture our products
 our
competitors&#x2019; products and their own products. They may devote
more resources to other products or take other actions detrimental
to our brands. In most cases
 they are able to terminate their
manufacturing arrangements with us without cause. We may need to
increase support for our brands in their territories and may not be
able to pass on price increases to them. Their financial condition
could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond our control
and our business could suffer as a result. Deteriorating economic
conditions could negatively impact the financial viability of
third-party manufacturers. Any of these factors could negatively
affect our business and financial performance.



















Failure of third-party distributors upon which we rely could
adversely affect our business.




heavily on third party distributors for the sale of our RTD
products to retailers. The loss of a significant distributor could
have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial
condition
 and results of operations. Our distributors may also
provide distribution services to competing brands
 as well as
larger
 national or international brands
 and may be to varying
degrees influenced by their continued business relationships with
other larger beverage
 and specifically
 healthy beverage
companies. Our independent distributors may be influenced by a
large competitor if they rely on that competitor for a significant
portion of their sales. There can be no assurance that our
distributors will continue to effectively market and distribute our
products. The loss of any distributor or the inability to replace a
poorly performing distributor in a timely fashion could have a
material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and
results of operations. Furthermore
 no assurance can be given that
we will successfully attract new distributors as they increase
their presence in their existing markets or expand into new
markets.


&#xA0;


We may fail to comply with applicable government laws and
regulations.




subject to a variety of federal
 state
 and local laws and
regulations in the U.S. and foreign countries
 some of which are
rapidly changing or at times conflicting. These laws and
regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the
manufacture
 safety
 labeling
 transportation
 advertising and sale
of our products. Violations of these laws or regulations in the
manufacture
 safety
 labeling
 transportation and advertising of
our products could damage our reputation and/or result in
regulatory actions with substantial penalties. In addition
 any
significant change in such laws or regulations or their
interpretation
 or the introduction of higher standards or more
stringent laws or regulations
 could result in increased compliance
costs or capital expenditures. For example
 changes in recycling
and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on our beverages and our
ingredients could increase our costs. Regulatory focus on the
health
 safety and marketing of beverage products is increasing.
Certain federal or state regulations or laws affecting the labeling
of our products
 such as California&#x2019;s &#x201C;Prop 65
&#x201D;
which requires warnings on any product with substances that the
state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects
 are or
could become applicable to our products.




Our IPCs could violate marketing or advertising laws or
regulations.




direct-to-consumer business
 we sell through IPCs. Each IPC signs
an agreement with Morinda
 agreeing to comply with all our policies
and procedures
 including without limitation our Policy Manual. Our
policies prohibit false and misleading advertising and the making
of improper health and income claims. We require IPCs to clear all
promotional materials in advance with our Compliance Department.
However
 despite our efforts
 from time to time
 IPCs violate our
policies and publish inappropriate marketing materials describing
our products or programs. It is impossible to monitor all social
media outlets and all IPC communications. Our Compliance Department
takes commercially reasonable means
 including a computer program
that actively searches for improper advertising
 to find improper
IPC advertising&#x2014;and when we find such advertising
 we require
the IPC to correct it. Some such promotional communications have
lingered for years in obscure places on the internet and
 by the
time we find them
 the IPC is no longer affiliated with us and is
not cooperative in removing the offending advertising. These
violations by IPCs could lead to actions against us by regulatory
agencies
 states&#x2019; attorney generals
 and private parties and
could have an adverse impact on our business
 financial condition
and operational results.

Cannabidiol
CBD)
product line is subject to varying
 and rapidly changing laws
regulations
 administrative practices
 enforcement approaches
judicial interpretations
 and consumer
perceptions



announced the launch of a new product line consisting of
CBD-infused beverages. Our intention is to commercialize the new
line as soon as regulations and laws permit in different
jurisdictions in markets worldwide. The cannabis industry is
evolving and subject to varying
 and rapidly changing laws
regulations
 administrative practices
 enforcement approaches
judicial interpretations
 and consumer perceptions. For example
the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 removes hemp from the
Controlled Substances Act and permits the production and marketing
of hemp and derivatives of cannabis with less than 0.3 percent
concentrations of THC. However
 in&#xA0; a statement from Scott
Gottlieb
 FDA Commissioner
 the Commissioner reemphasized its
agency 's authority to regulate products containing cannabis or
cannabis derived compounds under the&#xA0; Federal Food
 Drug and
Cosmetic Act and Section 351 of the Public Health Service
Act.




















Company does not intend to distribute and commercialize its CBD
product line in the U.S. until it believes it can do so in
conformity with applicable laws. Although the demand for our
products may be negatively impacted depending on how laws
regulations
 administrative practices
 enforcement approaches
judicial interpretations
 and consumer perceptions develop
&#xA0;
we cannot reasonably predict the nature of such developments or the
effect
 if any
 that such developments could have on our
business.




There is no guarantee that we will be able to commercialize our CBD
Infused beverages.




CBD-infused beverages are to be subject to an extended approval
process to comply with the FD&amp;C Act
 we may not be able to
commercialize our CBD-infused beverages or may have to delay
commercialization for an extended period of time. CBD products will
also be subject to registration and/or approval in foreign
jurisdictions in which the Company does business. It is uncertain
how a delay in commercializing our CBD products would impact our
Company.




Our ongoing investment in new product lines and products and
technologies is inherently risky and could disrupt our ongoing
businesses.




invested and expect to continue to invest in new product lines
products
 and technologies. Such endeavors may involve significant
risks and uncertainties
 including distraction of management from
current operations
 insufficient revenues to offset liabilities
assumed and expenses associated with these new investments
inadequate return of capital on our investments and unidentified
issues not discovered in our due diligence of such strategies and
offerings. Because these new ventures are inherently risky
 no
assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be
successful and will not adversely affect our reputation
 financial
condition
 and operating results.



We face various operating hazards that could result in the
reduction of our operations.




operations are subject to certain hazards and liability risks faced
by beverage companies that manufacture and distribute water
 tea
energy drink
 and dietary supplement products
 such as defective
products
 contaminated products
 and damaged products. The
occurrence of such a problem could result in a costly product
recall and serious damage to our reputation for product quality
 as
well as potential lawsuits. Although we maintain insurance against
certain risks under various general liability and product liability
insurance policies
 no assurance can be given that our insurance
will be adequate to fully cover any incidents of product
contamination or injuries resulting from our operations and our
products. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to
maintain insurance with adequate coverage for liabilities or risks
arising from our business operations on acceptable terms. Even if
the insurance is adequate
 insurance premiums could increase
significantly which could result in higher costs to
us.




Substantial disruption to production at our manufacturing and
distribution facilities could occur.




disruption in production at our beverage manufacturing facilities
could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition
a disruption could occur at any of our other facilities or those of
our suppliers
 bottlers
 or distributors. The disruption could
occur for many reasons
 including fire
 natural disasters
 weather
water scarcity
 manufacturing problems
 disease
 strikes
transportation or supply interruption
 government regulation
cybersecurity attacks or terrorism. Alternative facilities with
sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available
 may cost
substantially more
 or may take a significant time to start
production
 each of which could negatively affect our business and
financial performance.




We are subject to seasonality related to sales of our
products.




business is subject to substantial seasonal fluctuations.
Historically
 a significant portion of our net sales and net
earnings has been realized during the period from May through
September. Accordingly
 our operating results may vary
significantly from quarter to quarter. Our operating results for
any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of any other
results. If for any reason our sales were to be substantially below
seasonal norms
 our annual revenues and earnings could be
materially and adversely affected.


&#xA0;


Litigation and publicity concerning product quality
 health
 and
other issues could adversely affect our results of operations
business and financial condition.




business could be adversely affected by litigation and complaints
from customers or government authorities resulting from product
defects or product contamination. Adverse publicity about these
allegations may negatively affect us
 regardless of whether the
allegations are true
 by discouraging customers from buying our
products. We could also incur significant liabilities
 if a lawsuit
or claim results in a decision against us
 or litigation costs
regardless of the result. Further
 any litigation may distract our
key employees of cause them to expend resources and time normally
devoted to the operations of our business.



















We have experienced significant growth resulting in changes to our
organization and structure
 which if not effectively managed
 could
have a negative impact on our business.




headcount and operations have grown substantially in recent years.
We increased the number of full-time employees from 172 as of
December 31
 2017 to 889 as of December 31
 2018. We believe that
our corporate culture has been a critical component of our success.
We have invested substantial time and resources in building our
team and nurturing our culture. As we expand our business and
operate as a public company
 we may find it difficult to maintain
our corporate culture while managing our employee growth. Any
failure to manage our anticipated growth and related organizational
changes in a manner that preserves our culture could negatively
impact future growth and achievement of our business
objectives.




addition
 our organizational structure has become more complex as a
result of our significant growth. We have added employees and may
need to continue to scale and adapt our operational
 financial
 and
management controls
 as well as our reporting systems and
procedures. The expansion of our systems and infrastructure may
require us to commit additional financial
 operational
 and
management resources before our revenue increases and without any
assurances that our revenue will increase. If we fail to
successfully manage our growth
 we likely will be unable to
successfully execute our business strategy
 which could have a
negative impact on our business
 financial condition
 and results
of operations.

history.&#xA0; To the extent that we continue to generate taxable
losses
 unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable
income
 if any
 until such unused losses expire.&#xA0; Under
Internal Revenue Code (&#x201C;IRC&#x201D;) Section 382
 if a
corporation undergoes an &#x201C;ownership change
 &#x201C; generally
defined as a greater than 50 percent change (by value) in its
equity ownership by certain stockholders over a three year period
the corporation&#x2019;s ability to use its pre-change net operating
loss carryforwards
 or NOLs
 (and other pre-change tax attributes
as applicable) to offset its post change income may be
limited.&#xA0; We may have experienced ownership changes in the
past and may experience ownership changes in the future and/or
subsequent shifts in our stock ownership (some of which shifts are
outside our control).&#xA0; As a result
 if we generate net taxable
income
 our ability to use our pre-change NOLs to offset such
taxable income could be subject to limitations.&#xA0; Similar
provisions of state tax law may also apply.&#xA0; As a result
 even
if we attain profitability
 we may be unable to use a material
portion of our NOL&#x2019;s and other tax attributes.&#xA0; We plan
to perform an IRC Section 382 analysis to determine if there are
currently any limitations on the future use of our net operating
loss carryforwards.




Because of our combination with Morinda and because our long-term
growth strategy involves further expansion of our sales to
consumers outside the United States
 our business is susceptible to
risks associated with global operations.




the Morinda combination
 we now have subsidiaries in 25 countries
and sales in 60 countries. This provides access to international
markets for our traditional New Age product line. Still
 our
current global operations and future initiatives involve a variety
of risks
 including:






changes in a
specific country&#x2019;s or region&#x2019;s political or economic
conditions;







changes in
regulatory requirements
 taxes
 currency control laws
 or trade
laws;







more stringent
regulations relating to data security (e.g.
 the GDPR in Europe)
such as where and how data can be housed

 and used
 and
the unauthorized use of
 or access to
 commercial and personal
information;







differing labor
regulations
 especially in countries and geographies where labor
laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to
the United States
 including deemed hourly wage and overtime
regulations in these locations;







challenges inherent
in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large
geographic distances
 including the need to implement appropriate
systems
 policies

 and compliance programs;







increased travel
real estate
 infrastructure
 and legal compliance costs associated
with global operations;







currency exchange
rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and
expenses
 and the cost and risk of entering into hedging
transactions if we choose to do so in the future;







limitations on our
ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund
the capital needs of our operations in other
countries;







laws and business
practices favoring local competitors or general preferences for
local vendors;







limited or
insufficient intellectual property protection;

























political
instability or terrorist activities;







exposure to

repatriate earnings and cash.






are not able to successfully address the above risks that may arise
in connection with a global business
 our financial condition and
business result will be adversely affected.




Economic uncertainties or downturns in the general economy could
disproportionately affect the demand for our products and services
and negatively impact our results of operations.




worldwide economic conditions have experienced significant
fluctuations in recent years
 and market volatility and uncertainty
remain widespread. Furthermore
 during challenging economic times
our distribution customers may face issues with their cash flows
and in gaining timely access to sufficient credit or obtaining
credit on reasonable terms
 which could impair their ability to
make timely payments to us and adversely affect our revenue. If
such conditions occur
 we may be required to increase our
allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts
receivable
 and our results of operations would be harmed. An
economic turndown could
 also
 decrease demand for our nutritional
supplement products that are on the higher end of the price range.
The economic conditions in the U.S. and the various countries in
which we do business also impact foreign exchange rates. We cannot
predict the timing
 strength
 or duration of any economic slowdown
or recovery
 whether global
 regional or within specific markets.
If the conditions of the general economy or markets in which we
operate worsen
 our business could be harmed. In addition
 even if
the overall economy improves
 the market for our products and
services may not experience growth.

If we fail to enhance our brand
 our ability to expand our customer
base will be impaired and our financial condition may
suffer.




believe that the development of our trade names and various brands
are critical to achieving widespread awareness of our products
 and
as a result
 is important to attracting new customers and
maintaining existing customers. We also believe that the importance
of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market
increases. Successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on
the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to
provide reliable products at competitive prices. Brand promotion
activities may not yield increased revenue
 and even if they do
any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in
building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain
our brand
 our business could be adversely
impacted.&#xA0;


&#xA0;


We are a multinational organization faced with increasingly complex
tax issues in many jurisdictions
 and we could be obligated to pay
additional taxes in various jurisdictions.




multinational organization
 we may be subject to taxation in
several jurisdictions worldwide with increasingly complex tax laws
the application of which can be uncertain. Significant judgment is
required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.
In the ordinary course of our business
 there are many transactions
and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
For example
 compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cut and
Jobs Act (&#x201C;Tax Act&#x201D;) may require the collection of
information not regularly produced within our company and the
exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions.
Many aspects of the Tax Act are unclear and may not be clarified
for some time. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to
the Tax Act
 and as we gather more information and perform more
analysis
 our results may differ from previous estimates and may
materially affect our financial position.




amount of taxes we pay in jurisdictions in which we operate could
increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax
principles
 including increased tax rates
 new tax laws
 or revised
interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents
 which could
have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of
operations. In addition
 the authorities in these jurisdictions
could review our tax returns and impose additional tax
 interest
and penalties
 and the authorities could claim that various
withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert
that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our
subsidiaries
 any of which could have a material impact on us and
the results of our operations.


&#xA0;

















Future acquisitions
 strategic investments
 partnerships or
alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate
 divert the
attention of management
 disrupt our business
 dilute stockholder
value and adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations.




December 2018
 we completed a business combination with Morinda
 an
entity much larger than our business before this acquisition. We
previously acquired other businesses and product lines. We believe
convergence with Morinda and these other businesses have been and
continue to be successful. We may in the future seek to acquire or
invest in businesses and product lines that we believe could
complement or expand our product offerings
 or otherwise offer
growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may
divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various
expenses in identifying
 investigating
 and pursuing suitable
acquisitions
 whether or not the acquisitions are completed. If we
acquire businesses
 we may not be able to integrate successfully
the acquired personnel
 operations
 and technologies
 or
effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition.
We may not be able to find and identify desirable acquisition
targets or be successful in entering into an agreement with any
particular target or obtain adequate financing to complete such
acquisitions. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances
of equity securities or the incurrence of debt
 which could
adversely affect our results of operations. In addition
 if an
acquired business fails to meet our expectations
 our business
financial condition
 and results of operations may be adversely
affected.




If our security measures are compromised or unauthorized access to
customer data is otherwise obtained
 our services may be perceived
as not being secure
 customers may curtail or cease their use of
our services
 our reputation may be harmed
 and we may incur
significant liabilities. Further
 we are subject to governmental
and other legal obligations related to privacy
 and our actual or
perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our
business.

protected data of our customers. We rely on proprietary and
commercially available systems

 tools and monitoring
 as
well as other processes
 to provide security for accessing
processing
 sharing
 using
 storage
 and transmission of such
information. If our security measures are compromised as a result
of third-party action
 employee or customer error
 malfeasance
stolen or fraudulently obtained log-in credentials
 or otherwise
our reputation could be damaged
 our business and our customers may
be harmed
 and we could incur significant liabilities. In
particular
 cyberattacks
 phishing attacks
 and other
internet-based activity continue to increase in frequency and in
magnitude generally
 and these threats are being driven by a
variety of sources
 including nation-state sponsored espionage and
hacking activities
 industrial espionage
 organized crime
sophisticated organizations
 and hacking groups and individuals. In
addition
 if the security measures of our customers are
compromised
 even without any actual compromise of our own systems
we may face negative publicity or reputational harm if our
customers or anyone else incorrectly attributes the blame for such
security breaches on us
 our products and services
 or our systems.
We may also be responsible for repairing any damage caused to our
customers&#x2019; systems that we support
 and we may not be able to
make such repairs in a timely manner or at all. We may be unable to
anticipate or prevent techniques used to obtain unauthorized access
or to sabotage systems because they change frequently and generally
are not detected until after an incident has occurred. As we
increase our customer base and our brands become more widely known
and recognized
 we may become more of a target for third parties
seeking to compromise our security systems or gain unauthorized
access to our customers&#x2019; proprietary and protected
data.




governments have enacted laws requiring companies to notify
individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of
personal data. Security compromises experienced by our customers
by our competitors
 or by us may lead to public disclosures
 which
may lead to widespread negative publicity. Any security compromise
whether actual or perceived
 could harm our reputation
 erode
customer confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures
negatively impact our ability to attract new customers
 or subject
us to third party lawsuits
 government investigations
 regulatory
fines
 or other action or liability
 all or any of which could
materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition
and results of operations.




cannot assure you that any limitations of liability provisions in
our contracts for a security breach would be enforceable or
adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or
damages with respect to any particular claim. We also cannot be
sure which
 if any
 cyber related claims made against us would be
covered by our existing general liability insurance coverage and
coverage for errors or omissions
 whether this coverage or any
additional coverage the Company seeks will continue to be available
on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to
cover one or more claims
 or that the insurer will not deny
coverage as to any particular or future claim. The successful
assertion of one or more claims against us that exceed available
insurance coverage
 or the occurrence of changes in our insurance
policies
 including premium increases or the imposition of
substantial deductible or co-insurance requirements
 could have a
material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition
 and
results of operations.



















global company
 we are subject to numerous jurisdictions worldwide
regarding the accessing
 processing
 sharing
 using
 storing
transmitting
 disclosure and protection of personal data
 the scope
of which are constantly changing
 subject to differing
interpretation
 and may be inconsistent between countries or in
conflict with other laws
 legal obligations or industry standards.
For example
 the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of European Union
law and became effective in May 2018
 adds a broad array of
requirements for handling personal data including the public
disclosure of significant data breaches
 and imposes substantial
penalties for non-compliance. We have made a concerted effort to
comply with the GDPR and also generally comply with industry
standards and strive to comply with all applicable laws and other
legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection
 but it
is possible that these laws and legal obligations may be
interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one
jurisdiction to another and may conflict with industry standards or
our practices. Compliance with such laws and other legal
obligations may be costly and may require us to modify our business
practices
 which could adversely affect our business and
profitability. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply
with these laws
 policies or other obligations may result in
governmental enforcement actions or litigation against us
potential fines
 and other expenses related to such governmental
actions
 and could cause our customers to lose trust in us
 any of
which could have an adverse effect on our business.

Failure to comply with global laws and regulations could harm our
business.




business is subject to regulation by various global governmental
agencies
 including agencies responsible for monitoring and
enforcing employment and labor laws
 workplace safety
environmental laws
 consumer protection laws
 anti-bribery laws
import/export controls
 federal securities laws and tax laws and
regulations.




certain jurisdictions
 these regulatory requirements may be more
stringent than those in the United States. Noncompliance with
applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to
investigations
 sanctions
 mandatory recalls
 enforcement actions
disgorgement of profits
 fines
 damages
 civil and criminal
penalties or injunctions
 and may result in our inability to
provide certain products and services to prospective clients or
clients. If any governmental sanctions are imposed
 or if we do not
prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation
 or if clients
made claims against us for compensation
 our business
 financial
condition
 and results of operations could be harmed. In addition
responding to any action will likely result in a significant
diversion of management&#x2019;s attention and resources and an
increase in professional fees and costs. Enforcement actions and
sanctions could further harm our business
 financial condition and
results of operations.&#xA0;




Our China business accounts for a significant part of our revenue
and anticipated growth. Any decline in sales in China would harm
our business results
 as would any adverse regulatory action.
Repatriation of profits from China may not be ensured.




operations in China are conducted by Morinda&#x2019;s wholly owned
subsidiary
 Tahitian Noni Beverages (China) Company Limited
(&#x201C;TNI China&#x201D;). TNI China received a coveted direct
selling license from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce in 2015. Our
China sales have been growing at a robust
 double-digit rate for
the past several years
 making China Morinda&#x2019;s second largest
market. If we are not able to continue to grow sales through our
TNI China business
 it will have an adverse impact on our global
results.




is a large and vibrant market but doing business in China requires
navigation of a difficult regulatory environment. China has
published regulations governing direct selling&#x2014;and a number
of administrative methods and proclamations have been issued. These
regulations require TNI China to use a business model different
from the one Morinda offers in other markets. For TNI China to
operate under these regulations
 we have created and implemented a
model specifically for China. However
 it cannot be ensured that
interpretations of direct selling laws will not adversely affect
our business in China or lead to fines against us or our
IPCs.



can take one to three years to obtain product registrations in
China. The lengthy process for obtaining product registrations
often prevents us from launching new product initiatives in China
on the same timelines as other markets around the
world.




regulations prevent persons who are not Chinese nationals from
engaging in direct selling in China. We cannot guarantee that any
of our IPCs that do not have a China presence or any of IPCs or
wholesalers in China have not engaged or will not engage in
activities that violate our policies in this market
 or that
violate Chinese law or other applicable law
 and therefore result
in regulatory action and adverse publicity.



















Our operations in China are subject to risks and
uncertainties related to general economic
 political
 and legal
developments in China. For example
s a result of negative
media coverage about the healthcare-related product claims made by
a competitor in the direct selling industry in China
 the
government has recently increased its scrutiny of activities within
the healthcare market


significant control over the Chinese economy
 including but not
limited to controlling capital investments
 allocating resources
setting monetary policy
 controlling foreign exchange and
monitoring foreign exchange rates
 implementing and overseeing tax
regulations
 providing preferential treatment to certain industry
segments or companies
 and issuing necessary licenses to conduct
business. Accordingly
 any adverse change in the Chinese economy
the Chinese legal system
 or Chinese governmental
 economic
 or
other policies could have a material adverse effect on our business
in China and our prospects generally.




the past several years
 the Company has been able to receive
periodic license fees and annual dividends from TNI China. However
there is no guarantee this will continue
 and any change in
government policy affecting payment of license fees or repatriation
of profits could harm the results and financial performance of the
Company and reduce the Company&#x2019;s access to cash
resources.




Limits on the amount of sales compensation we can pay to our IPCs
in certain countries could harm our business and cause regulatory
risks.




&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;
&#xA0;&#xA0; Certain markets
 including China
 Korea
 Indonesia
and Vietnam
 impose limits on the amount of sales compensation we
can pay our IPCs. For example
 in Korea
 local regulations limit
sales compensation to 35% of our total revenue in Korea. These
regulations may inhibit persons from becoming IPCs or cause
interested persons to join competitors that are not focused on
compliance. We have had to modify our compensation plan in certain
markets to be in compliance. It is difficult to keep compensation
within limits and we may
 therefore
 be at risk of violating limits
even as we are trying to act in accordance with the regulations. It
is not always clear which revenues and expenses are within the
scope of regulations. Any failure to keep sales compensation within
legal limits in the above and other markets could result in fines
or other sanctions
 including suspensions.




Catastrophic events may disrupt our business.

systems for our business operations. A disruption or failure of
these systems in the event of online attack
 earthquake
 fire
terrorist attack
 power loss
 telecommunications failure or other
catastrophic event could cause system interruptions
 delays in
accessing our service
 reputational harm
 loss of critical data or
could prevent us from providing our products and services to our
clients. In addition
 some of our employee groups reside in areas
particularly susceptible to earthquakes
 such as Utah and Japan
and a major earthquake or other catastrophic event could affect our
employees
 who may not be able to access our systems or otherwise
continue to provide our services to our customers. A catastrophic
event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data
centers
 or our network infrastructure or information technology
systems
 or access to our systems
 could affect our ability to
conduct normal business operations and adversely affect our
business
 financial condition
 and results of
operations.


&#xA0;


Changes in financial accounting standards or practices may cause
adverse
 unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our
reported results of operations.




accounting principles in the United States are subject to
interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(&#x201C;FASB&#x201D;)
 the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
&#x201C;SEC&#x201D;) and various bodies formed to promulgate and
interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in accounting
standards or practices can have a significant effect on our
reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions
completed before the change is effective. New accounting
pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting
pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes
to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may
adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we
conduct our business.




We may be unable to meet the obligations of various financial
covenants that are contained in our loan agreement with&#xA0;our
senior lender
&#xA0;East West Bank.



Our loan agreement with East West Bank impose
various obligations and financial covenants on the Company. The
loan facility has a variable interest rate and is collateralized by
substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries. In addition
 the loan agreement imposes various
financial covenants on the Company including maintaining a
prescribed fixed charge coverage ratio
 minimum adjusted EBITDA
minimum net cash and total leverage ratio. In addition the loan
agreement limits the Company&#x2019;s ability to dispose of all or
any part of its business or property; merge or consolidate with or
into any other business organization; incur or prepay additional
indebtedness; declare or pay any dividend or make a distribution on
any class of our stock; or enter into specified material

covenants.



















It is difficult and costly to protect and enforce our proprietary
rights.




commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining
trademark protection
 patent protection
 and trade secret
protection of our products and brands
 as well as successfully
defending that intellectual property against third-party
challenges. We will only be able to protect our intellectual
property related to our trademarks
 patents
 and brands to the
extent that we have obtained rights under valid and enforceable
trademarks
 patents
 or trade secrets that cover our products and
brands. Changes in either the trademark and patent laws or in
interpretations of trademark and patent laws in the U.S. and other
countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property.
Accordingly
 we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be
allowed or enforced in our issued trademarks or our issued patents.
The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is
uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and
may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep
our competitive advantage.




We may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be
time-consuming and costly to defend
 and could result in our loss
of significant rights and the assessment of treble
damages.


&#xA0;


time to time we may face intellectual property infringement
misappropriation
 or invalidity/non-infringement claims from third
parties. Some of these claims may lead to litigation. The outcome
of any such litigation can never be guaranteed
 and an adverse
outcome could affect us negatively. For example
 werea third party
to succeed on an infringement claim against us
 we may be required
to pay substantial damages (including up to treble damages if such
infringement were found to be willful). In addition
 we could face
an injunction
 barring us from conducting the allegedly infringing
activity. The outcome of the litigation could require us to enter
into a license agreement which may not be under acceptable
commercially reasonable
 or practical terms or we may be precluded
from obtaining a license at all. It is also possible that an
adverse finding of infringement against us may require us to
dedicate substantial resources and time in developing
non-infringing alternatives
 which may or may not be possible. In
the case of diagnostic tests
 we would also need to include
non-infringing technologies which would require us to re-validate
our tests. Any such re-validation
 in addition to being costly and
time consuming
 may be unsuccessful.




 we may
initiate claims to assert or defend our own intellectual property
against third parties. Any intellectual property litigation
irrespective of whether we are the plaintiff or the defendant
 and
regardless of the outcome
 is expensive and time-consuming
 and
could divert our management&#x2019;s attention from our business and
negatively affect our operating results or financial
condition.

We may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our
employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property
or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual
property.

 our employees
 and independent contractors

of others in their work for us
 we may be subject to claims that
we
 our employees
 or independent contractors have used or
disclosed intellectual property in violation of others&#x2019;
rights. These claims may cover a range of matters
 such as
challenges to our trademarks
 as well as claims that our employees
or independent contractors are using trade secrets or other
proprietary information of any such employee&#x2019;s former
employer or independent contractors. As a result
 we may be forced
to bring claims against third parties
 or defend claims they may
bring against us
 to determine the ownership of what we regard as
our intellectual property. If we fail in prosecuting or defending
any such claims
 in addition to paying monetary damages
 we may
lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we
are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims
litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction
to management.




Risks Related to our Common Stock and Corporate
Governance


&#xA0;


The price of our common stock may be volatile and adversely
affected by several factors.




market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly in

external factors; and






the general state
of the securities market.






market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price
of our common stock
 regardless of our operating performance.
Securities markets have from time to time experienced significant
price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the performance
of particular companies.




Our stock price has in the past and may in the future fluctuate
based on developments in the cannabis industry.


&#xA0;


market price of our common stock has in the past fluctuated in
response to developments in the cannabis industry and has
experienced price swings in tandem with industry leaders in the
cannabis market. As such
 we have experienced fluctuations in the
market price of our stock unrelated to the financial performance of
our core business. The trading price of our common stock is likely
to continue to be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations
based on developments and changes in the cannabis industry. Such
fluctuations may limit or prevent investors from readily selling
their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect
the liquidity of our common stock.




You may experience future dilution as a result of future equity
offerings.

In order to raise additional capital
 we may in
the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other
securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to sell shares or other
securities in any other offering at a price per share that is equal

negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair
your ability to sell or purchase our commonstock when you wish to
do so. In the event of a delisting
 we would take actions to

East West Bank Loan Agreement



&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; On March 29
 2019
 we entered
into a Loan and Security Agreement (the &#x201C;Loan
Agreement&#x201D;) with East West Bank (&#x201C;EWB&#x201D;).&#xA0;
The Loan Agreement matures on March 29
 2023 and provides for (i) a
term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $15.0 million
 which
may be increased to $25.0 subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions (the &#x201C;Term Loan&#x201D;) and (ii) a $10.0 million
revolving loan facility (the &#x201C;Revolving Loan
Facility&#x201D;). At the closing

consisting of the $15.0 million Term Loan and $10.0 as an advance
Our obligations under
the Loan Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets
 The Loan Agreement requires compliance

financial covenants include maintenance of minimum Adjusted EBITDA
and a maximum Total Leverage Ratio (all as defined and set forth in
the Loan Agreement). During any periods when an event of default
occurs
 the Loan Agreement provides for interest at a rate that is
3.0% above the rate otherwise applicable to such
obligations.



&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Borrowings outstanding under
the Loan Agreement will bear interest at the Prime Rate plus 0.25%.
However
 if the Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Loan
Agreement) is equal to or greater than 1.50 to 1.00
 borrowings
will bear interest at the Prime Rate plus 0.50%. We may voluntarily
prepay amounts outstanding under the Revolving Loan Facility on ten
business days&#x2019; prior notice to EWB without prepayment
charges. In the event the Revolving Loan Facility is terminated
prior to its maturity
 we would be required to pay an early
termination fee in the amount of 0.50% of the revolving line.
Additional borrowing requests under the Revolving Loan Facility are
subject to various customary conditions precedent
 including
satisfaction of a borrowing base test as more fully described in
The
Revolving Loan Facility also provides for an unused line fee equal
to 0.5% per annum of the undrawn portion. The Loan Agreement
includes a lockbox arrangement that requires that we direct our
customers to remit payments to a restricted bank account
 whereby
all available funds are used to pay down the outstanding principal
balance under the Revolving Loan Facility.


















Payments under the Term Loan are interest-only for
the first six months and are followed by principal and interest
payments amortized over the remaining term of the Term Loan. We may
elect to prepay the Term Loan before its maturity on 10 business
days&#x2019; notice to EWB subject to a prepayment fee of 2% for the

Siena Revolver



March 29

 simultaneously with our entry into the new loan
facility with East West Bank discussed below
 we repaid all
outstanding amounts under the Siena Revolver
 including a
prepayment fee of $0.5 million.



Sale Leaseback



&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;
&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; On March 22
 2019
 we entered into an agreement
with a major Japanese real estate company resulting in the sale for
approximately $55 million of the land and building in Tokyo that
serves as the corporate headquarters of Morinda&#x2019;s Japanese
subsidiary. Concurrently with the sale
 we entered into a lease of
this property for an initial noncancelable term of seven years
with an option at our discretion to extend the lease term for 20
additional years. The monthly lease cost is &#xA5;20 million
(approximately $181
000 as of March 22
 2019) for the initial
seven-year term.



&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;
&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;In connection with this transaction
 we
repaid the $2.9 million mortgage on the building
 cancelled the
related interest rate swap agreement
 and we are obligated to pay
$25.0 million to the former stockholders of Morinda to eliminate
the contingent financing liability incurred under the business
combination. After these payments
 income taxes
 post-closing
repair obligations
 and transaction costs
 the net proceeds from
the sale leaseback are expected to be between $9.0 million and
$12.0 million.

Key Components of Consolidated Statements of
Operations


&#xA0;


We recognize revenue when products are delivered and when title and
the risk of ownership passes to our customers. Revenue consists of
the gross sales price
 net of estimated returns and allowances
discounts
 and personal rebates that are accounted for as a
reduction from the gross sale price. Shipping and handling charges
that are billed to customers are included as a component of
revenue.


&#xA0;


Cost of goods sold primarily consists of product costs and freight.
Since we use third-party suppliers to manufacture our products
 we
don&#x2019;t capitalize overhead as part of our
inventories.


&#xA0;

















Commissions earned by our sales and marketing personnel are charged
to expense in the same period that the related sales transactions
are recognized.


&#xA0;

Selling
 general and

 general and administrative
expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our
administrative
 human resources
 finance and accounting employees
and executives. General and administrative expenses also include
contract labor and consulting costs
related expenses
 legal
 auditing and
other professional fees
 rent and facilities costs
 repairs and
maintenance
 advertising and marketing costs
 and general corporate
expenses.


&#xA0;

Business combination

 the
acquisition-related transaction costs are accounted for as expenses
in the periods in which such costs are incurred.&#xA0;When we enter
business combinations
 a portion of the consideration may be
contingent on future operating performance of the acquired
business. In these circumstances
 we determine the fair value of
the contingent consideration as a component of the purchase price
and all future changes in the fair value of our obligations is
reflected as an adjustment to our operating expenses in the period
that the change is determined.



Depreciation and

consists of depreciation expense related to property
 plant and
equipment
 amortization expense related to leasehold improvements
and amortization expense related to identifiable intangible
assets.




Interest expense is incurred under our revolving credit facilities
and other debt obligations. The components of interest expense
include the amount of interest payable in cash at the stated
interest rate
 make-whole applicable premium
 accretion of debt
discounts and issuance costs using the effective interest method
and the write-off of debt discounts and issuance costs if we prepay
the debt before the maturity date.


&#xA0;

Loss on change in fair

features referred to as embedded derivatives that are required to
be bifurcated and recorded at fair value. Embedded derivatives
include requirements to pay default interest upon the existence of
an event of default and to pay &#x201C;make-whole&#x201D; interest
for certain mandatory and voluntary prepayments of the outstanding
principal balance under the Siena Revolver. We perform valuations
of the embedded derivatives on a quarterly basis. Changes in the
fair value of embedded derivatives are reflected as a
operating gain or loss
in our consolidated statements of operations.


&#xA0;

Other income (expense)

 net consists primarily of
interest income and non-operating expenses.



Gain from sale of property

are reflected in the period that the sale transaction closes.
Impairment losses related long-lived assets are generally reflected
as operating expenses in the period that an asset is determined to
be impaired.


&#xA0;


The provision for income taxes is based on the amount of our
taxable income and enacted federal
 state and foreign tax rates
 as
adjusted for allowable credits and deductions. Our provision for
income taxes consists only of foreign taxes for the periods
presented as we had no taxable income for U.S. federal or state
purposes. In addition
 because of our lack of domestic earnings
history
 the domestic net deferred tax assets have been fully
offset by a valuation allowance and no tax benefit has been
recognized.

Comparison of Years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017


&#xA0;

 Net
revenue was unchanged at $52.2 million for the years ended December
31
 2018 and 2017. Net revenue for the New Age segment decreased
from $52.2 million for the year ended December 31
 2017 to $48.3
million for the year ended December 31
 2018
 a decrease of $3.8
million or 7%. The decrease in net revenue for the New Age segment
was primarily attributable to an increase in discounts and
allowances of $2.5 million which was driven by the negative impact
related to working capital constraints during 2018
 which severely
constricted inventory levels and the Company&#x2019;s ability to
meet the demands of major distributors and retailers. The other
major impact between gross and net revenue level was an increase in
billbacks and discounts from one of our major distributors where we
were impacted by significant charges on shipments we shorted
because of our inventory challenges
 and we faced a high level of
changeover charges related to the Coco-Libre brand. For the year
ended December 31
 2018
 the Morinda acquisition contributed net
revenue of $3.8 million for the post acquisition period from
December 21
 2018 through December 31
 2018.




















Cost of goods sold increased from $39.8 million for the year ended
December 31
 2017 to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31
2018
 an increase of $3.1 million or 8%. Cost of goods sold for the
New Age segment increased from $39.8 million for the year ended
December 31
 2017 to $42.0 million for the year ended December 31
2018
 an increase of $2.2 million or 5%. This increase in cost of
goods sold was due to higher product costs since we were making
smaller production runs and buying raw materials in smaller amounts
on the spot market
 so we were not getting economies of scale with
our product which was related to our working capital constraints
during 2018.




year ended December 31
 2018
 cost of goods sold for the Morinda
acquisition was $0.9 million for the post acquisition period from
December 21
 2018 through December 31
 2018.


&#xA0;

 Gross
profit decreased from $12.4 million for the year ended December 31
2017 to $9.3 million for the year ended December 31
 2018
 a
decrease of $3.1 million or 25%. Gross margin decreased from 24%
for the year ended December 31
 2017 to 18% for the year ended
December 31
 2018. As discussed below the decrease in gross margin
was primarily due to higher product costs on lower net revenues for
the New Age segment.




profit for the New Age segment decreased by $6.0 million for the
year ended December 31
 2018
 primarily due to a decrease in net
revenue of $3.8 million and an increase in cost of goods sold of
$2.2 million as discussed above. As a result
 gross margin for the
New Age segment decreased from 24% for the year ended December 31
2017 to 13% for the year ended December 31
 2018. The lower gross
margins for the New Age segment in 2018 are not indicative of our
expectations for the year ending December 31
 2019
 due to the
working capital constraints that negatively impacted our net
revenue and our production costs in 2018. As discussed under


 the conditions that constrained the
availability of funding for working capital requirements have been
resolved by our debt and equity financing activities over the past
five months. Therefore
 we expect improved margins for the New Age
segment beginning in the second quarter of 2019.




period from December 21
 2018 through December 31
 2018
 gross
profit for the Morinda acquisition was $0.9 million and gross
margin was 76%. For pre-acquisition periods in 2018 and 2017
Morinda&#x2019;s gross margin was approximately 80%. We don&#x2019;t
believe the lower gross margin for the post-acquisition period is
indicative of a trend
 but rather is a factor of the short period
of time and holidays during which Morinda&#x2019;s results are
consolidated with ours.


&#xA0;


Commissions increased from $1.5 million for the year ended December
31
 2017 to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31
 2018
 an
increase of $1.3 million. This increase was due to the Morinda
acquisition which resulted in commissions of $1.5 million for the
post acquisition period from December 21
 2018 through December 31
2018. Under Morinda&#x2019;s business model
 commissions typically
range between 38% and 40% of net revenue whereas commissions for
the New Age segment are typically about 3% of net
revenue.



Selling
 general and

 general and administrative
expenses increased from $15.4 million for the year ended December
31
 2017 to $20.3 million for the year ended December 31
 2018
 an
increase of $4.9 million or 32%. This increase was primarily
attributable to (i) $1.5 million related to Morinda for the post
acquisition period from December 21
 2018 through December 31
2018
 (ii) an increase in other compensation and benefits of $1.4
million
 (iii) an increase in stock-based compensation of $0.8
million
 (iv) an increase in rent and occupancy costs of $0.5
million
 and an increase in professional fees of $0.4
million.




compensation and benefit costs and professional fees have increased
in 2018 due to the significant growth that resulted from three
acquisitions in 2017 and one acquisition in 2018. Due to the growth
of our business and our status as a public company
 we expect these
costs will continue to increase as we address the accounting and
financial reporting requirements of a significantly more complex
business structure.



Business combination

financial advisory services and professional fees associated with
the business combination are not included as a component of the
consideration transferred but are accounted for as expenses in the
periods in which such costs are incurred.&#xA0;Acquisition-related
transaction costs related to business combinations increased from
$0.2 million for the year ended December 31
 2017 to $3.2 million
for the year ended December 31
 2018
 an increase of $3.0 million.
In connection with the acquisition of Morinda
 we incurred
transaction costs of $3.2 million
 including (i) payment of cash of
$1.1 million and issuance of 214
250 shares of Common Stock with a
fair value of $1.2 million to a financial advisor that assisted
with the consummation of the Merger
 and (ii) professional fees and
other incremental and direct costs associated with the Merger of
$0.9 million. For the year ended December 31
 2017
 we incurred
transaction costs of $0.2 million in connection with the Maverick
business combination.




















addition
 as part of the Marley transaction in 2017
 we agreed to
make a one-time earnout payment of $1.25 million if revenue for the
Marley reporting unit is equal to or greater than $15.0 million
during any trailing twelve calendar month period after the closing.
The fair value of the earnout was valued using the weighted average
return on assets and amounted to $0.8 million on the closing date.
During 2018
 we determined that the fair value of this earnout
obligation had increase to $0.9 million. Accordingly
 we recognized
an expense of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31
2018.



Depreciation and

increased from $1.6 million for the year ended December 31
 2017 to
$2.3 million for the year ended December 31
 2018
 an increase of
$0.7 million. This increase was due to (i) an increase of $0.5
million due to full year of amortization expense in 2018 related to
approximately $20.0 million of identifiable intangible assets
associated with the Maverick
 PMC and Marley acquisitions that
closed in the first half of 2017
 and (ii) approximately $0.2
million of depreciation and amortization related to the Morinda
acquisition for the post acquisition period from December 21
 2018
through December 31
 2018. Due to the Morinda acquisition
 we
expect a significant increase in depreciation and amortization
expense for the year ending December 31
 2019.


&#xA0;


Interest expense increased from $0.2 million for the year ended
December 31
 2017 to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31
2018
 an increase of $0.9 million. The entire increase in interest
expense was attributable to a Senior Secured Convertible Promissory
Note with a principal balance of $4.75 million that was borrowed in
June 2018 and provided for a maturity date in June 2019. Due to the
early extinguishment of in August 2018
 we recognized accretion for
all of the debt discount and issuance costs of $0.6 million for the
year ended December 31
 2018. In addition
 we incurred interest
expense of $0.1 million and a make-whole prepayment fee of $0.2
million for the year ended December 31
 2018.



Loss on change in fair

 we entered
into the Siena Revolver that provides for borrowings up to $12.0

features that were determined to be embedded derivatives requiring
bifurcation and accounting as separate financial instruments. We
determined that embedded derivatives include the requirement to pay
(i) an early termination premium if the Siena Revolver is
terminated before the Maturity Date
 and (ii) default interest at a
5.0% premium if events of default exist. An early termination
premium is required to be paid if Siena&#x2019;s commitment to make
revolving loans is terminated prior to the Maturity Date in August
2021. The fee is equal to 4.00%
 2.25% and 1.25% of the $12.0
million commitment if termination occurs during the first
 second
and third years after August 2018 closing date
respectively.




December 31
 2018
 the fair value of these embedded derivatives was
$0.5 million which resulted in the recognition of a loss of $0.5
million for the year ended December 31
 2018. Increases in the fair
value of embedded derivatives result in losses that are recognized
when the likelihood increases that a future cash payment will be
required to settle an embedded derivative
 whereas gains are
recognized when the fair value decreases. Decreases in fair value
occur when we become contractually obligated to pay an embedded
derivative (whereby the embedded derivative liability is
transferred to a contractual liability)
 or as the likelihood of a
future cash settlement decreases. The loss of $0.5 million for the
year ended December 31
 2018 was due to our assessment that the
probability of a prepayment event was likely before the first
anniversary of the Siena Revolver. On March 29
 2019
 we terminated
the Siena Revolver with the proceeds of the East West Bank
. As a
result
 we incurred a prepayment fee of $480
000 that will be
recognized as an expense for the first quarter of 2019 and this
expense will be offset by a gain of $470
000 due to elimination of
the derivative.



Other income (expense)

 2017
 we had net other
expense of $0.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31
2018
 when we had net other expense of $0.2 million.



Gain from sale of

 2017
 we entered into an agreement
with an unaffiliated third party resulting in the sale for $8.9
million of the land and building that serves as our corporate
headquarters in Denver
 Colorado. Concurrently with the sale
 we
entered into a lease of this property for an initial term of ten
years
 with two options to extend for successive five-year periods.
This transaction qualified as a sale under ASU 2016-02
&#x201D;)
whereby a gain of approximately $3.3 million was recognized for the
year ended December 31
 2017. For the year ended December 31
 2018
we did not sell any of our property and equipment.




Due to a valuation allowance for our deferred income tax assets
 we
did not recognize an income tax benefit for the year ended December
31
 2017. For the year ended December 31
 2018
 we recognized an
income tax benefit of $8.9 million as a result of deferred income
tax liabilities of $9.9 million recorded in connection with the
Morinda business combination. We determined that our net operating
loss carryforwards will offset any income tax expense related the
deferred income tax liabilities for Morinda. Accordingly
 we
recognized an $8.9 million deferred income tax benefit for the year
ended December 31
 2018.



















Liquidity and Capital Resources




Overview


&#xA0;


December 31
 2018
 we had cash and cash equivalents of $42.5
million and working capital of $40.9 million. For the year ended
December 31
 2018
 we incurred a net loss of $12.1 million and cash
used in operating activities was $22.0 million.




contractual obligations of approximately $50.8 million that are due
during the 12 months ending December 31
 2019. This amount includes
(i) payables to the former stockholders of Morinda for $34.0
million
 (ii) operating lease payments of $6.3 million
 (iii) open
purchase orders of $4.8 million
 (iv) estimated payments due under
the Siena Revolver of $2.7 million
 and (v) principal due under a
foreign mortgage for $1.3 million. Of the $50.8 million of
contractual obligations
 $25.0 million is payable to the extent
that proceeds up to this amount are received in a sale leaseback
financing that closed on March 22
 2019
 and that will be paid in
the second quarter of 2019. Accordingly
 we will only be required
to satisfy $25.8 million of these contractual obligations from our
existing capital resources as the $25.0 million payable is netted
from the sales proceeds from the sale leaseback of our Japanese
building that is discussed in Note 16 to our consolidated financial
statements included in Item 8 of this Report. We expect the net
proceeds from the sale leaseback will range between $9.0 million
and $12.0 million.




on our expectations for future growth in net revenue for the
Morinda and New Age segments
 we believe our cash flow from
operating activities for the year ending December 31
 2019
combined with (i) our existing cash resources of $42.5 million
(ii) up to $12.0 million of net proceeds from the Japanese sale
leaseback
 and (iii) net proceeds of approximately $22.4 million
from the East West Bank loan (net of payoff of the Siena Revolver)
as discussed below
 will be sufficient to fund our working capital
requirements and the remainder of our net contractual obligations
of $19.1 million.




Siena Revolver




In August 2018
 we entered into a loan and security agreement with
Siena Lending Group LLC (&#x201C;Siena&#x201D;) that provided for a
$12.0 million revolving credit facility (the &#x201C;Siena
Revolver&#x201D;) with a scheduled maturity date of August 10
 2021
(the &#x201C;Maturity Date&#x201D;). Outstanding borrowings provided
for interest at the greater of (i) 7.5% or (ii) the prime rate plus
2.75%. As of December 31
 2018
 the effective interest rate was
8.25%. Beginning in November 2018
 we were required to pay interest
on a minimum of $2.0 million of borrowings
 regardless of whether
such funds had been borrowed. The Siena Revolver also provided for
an unused line fee equal to 0.5% per annum of the undrawn portion
of the $12.0 million commitment. The Siena Revolver was subject to
availability based on eligible accounts receivables and eligible
As of December&#xA0;31
2018
 the borrowing base calculation permitted total borrowings of
approximately $2.5 million. After deducting the outstanding
principal balance of $2.0 million
 we had excess borrowing
availability of $0.5 million as of December 31


 we
granted a security interest in substantially all assets and
intellectual property of the Company and its subsidiaries
 except
for such assets owned by Morinda.


&#xA0;


The Siena Revolver contained standard and customary events of
default including
 but not limited to
 maintaining compliance with
the financial and

The financial covenants
required maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio of less than
1.1 if excess borrowing availability was less than $1.0 million
and to maintain minimum liquidity of $2.0 million. The fixed charge
coverage ratio compares EBITDA
 net of unfinanced capital
expenditures
 to fixed charges for the latest quarterly reporting
period. As of December 31
 2018
 we were in compliance with the
Siena

 or merging with other entities without
The
Siena Revolver included a lockbox arrangement that required that we
direct our customers to remit payments to a restricted bank
account
 whereby all available funds were used to pay down the
outstanding principal balance under the Siena
Revolver.




On March 29
 2019
 simultaneously with our entry into the new loan
facility with East West Bank discussed below
 we repaid all
outstanding amounts under the Siena Revolver
 including a
prepayment fee of $0.5 million.



















East West Bank Loan Agreement



On March 29
 2019
 we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement
(the &#x201C;Loan Agreement&#x201D;) with East West Bank
(&#x201C;EWB&#x201D;).&#xA0; The Loan Agreement matures on March 29
2023 and provides for (i) a term loan in the aggregate principal
amount of $15.0 million
 which may be increase to $25.0 subject to
the satisfaction of certain conditions (the &#x201C;Term
Loan&#x201D;) and (ii) a $10.0 million revolving loan facility (the
&#x201C;Revolving Loan Facility&#x201D;). At the closing
 EWB funded
$25.0 million to us consisting of the $15.0 million Term Loan and


obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by substantially
all of our assets and guaranteed by certain of our
 The Loan
Agreement requires compliance with certain financial and

customary events of default. Key financial covenants include
maintenance of minimum Adjusted EBITDA and a maximum Total Leverage
Ratio (all as defined and set forth in the Loan Agreement). During
any periods when an event of default occurs
 the Loan Agreement
provides for interest at a rate that is 3.0% above the rate
otherwise applicable to such obligations.



Borrowings outstanding under the Loan Agreement will bear interest
at the Prime Rate plus 0.25%. However
 if the Total Leverage Ratio
(as defined in the Loan Agreement) is equal to or greater than 1.50
to 1.00
 borrowings will bear interest at the Prime Rate plus
0.50%. We may voluntarily prepay amounts outstanding under the
Revolving Loan Facility on ten business days&#x2019; prior notice to
EWB without prepayment charges. In the event the Revolving Loan
Facility is terminated prior to its maturity
 we would be required
to pay an early termination fee in the amount of 0.50% of the
revolving line. Additional borrowing requests under the Revolving
Loan Facility are subject to various customary conditions

 including satisfaction of a borrowing base test as more
The Revolving Loan Facility also provides for an
unused line fee equal to 0.5% per annum of the undrawn portion. The
Loan Agreement includes a lockbox arrangement that requires that we
direct our customers to remit payments to a restricted bank
account
 whereby all available funds are used to pay down the
outstanding principal balance under the Revolving Loan
Facility.




Payments under the Term Loan are interest-only for the first six
months and are followed by principal and interest payments
amortized over the remaining term of the Term Loan. We may elect to
prepay the Term Loan before its maturity on 10 business days&#x2019;
notice to EWB subject to a prepayment fee of 2% for the first year
of the Term Loan and 1% for the second year of the Term

fiscal year

year ended December 31
 2018
 our net loss of $12.1 million and a
non-cash deferred income tax benefit of $8.9 million resulted in
combined negative operating cash flow of $21.1 million. However
non-cash expenses partially mitigated this impact by $7.6 million.
For the year ended December 31
 2018
 non-cash expenses of $7.6
million included depreciation and amortization expense of $2.3
million
 stock-based compensation expense of $2.5 million
acquisition costs settled in shares of Common Stock for $1.2
million
 accretion and amortization of debt discount and issuance
costs of $0.8 million
 and a loss from change in fair value of
embedded derivatives of $0.5 million. Additionally
 a cash expense
for make-whole applicable premium of $0.2 million was classified as
a financing cash outflow since it related to the prepayment of
debt.




year ended December 31
 2018
 changes in operating assets and
liabilities used $8.4 million of operating cash flows including (i)
an increase in inventories of $3.4 million
 (ii) an increase in
prepaid expenses and other assets of $1.8 million
 and (iii) an
increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $4.4
million. These uses of cash total $9.6 million and were partially
offset by cash collections that resulted in a decrease in accounts
receivable of $1.3 million.




year ended December 31
 2017
 cash flows used in operating
activities amounted to $8.4 million. While we recognized a net loss
of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31
 2017
 net non-cash
expenses of $0.2 million mitigated the cash impact of our net loss.
For the year ended December 31
 2017
 non-cash expenses amounted to
$3.4 million including depreciation and amortization expense of
$1.6 million
 stock-based compensation expense of $1.7 million
 and
accretion and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of
$0.1 million. These non-cash expenses of approximately $3.4 million
were partially offset by a $3.3 million gain from sale of our
building in Denver
 Colorado.




year ended December 31
 2017
 changes in operating assets and
liabilities used $5.0 million of operating cash flows including (i)
an increase in accounts receivable of $2.3 million
 (ii) an
increase in inventories of $0.3 million
 (iii) an increase in
prepaid expenses and other assets of $0.5 million
 and (iii) an
increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $2.0
million.




Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities




used in investing activities was primarily driven by three business
combinations in our New Age segment that were completed in 2017 and
the Morinda segment business combination in 2018. For the year
ended December 31
 2018
 our principal use of cash in investing
activities resulted from a cash payment of $75.0 million to
purchase the Morinda segment in December 2018. This cash payment
was offset by the cash
 cash equivalents and restricted cash that
we acquired from Morinda for a total of $46.3 million. The net
amount of cash paid to acquire the Morinda segment of $28.7 million
is reflected as an investing cash outflow for the year ended
December 31
 2018. For the year ended December 31
 2018
 we also
made capital expenditures primarily for machinery and equipment for
$0.7 million. Of the $0.7 million of capital expenditures
approximately $0.6 million related to our Morinda
segment.




year ended December 31
 2017
 our principal use of cash in
investing activities resulted from a cash payment of $2.0 million
to acquire the Maverick reporting unit in March 2017. For the year
ended December 31
 2017
 we also made capital expenditures
primarily for machinery and equipment in our New Age segment for
$0.7 million.



















Cash Flows from Financing Activities




financing activities provided net cash proceeds of $1.9 million for
the year ended December 31
 2017 as compared to $96.4 million for
the year ended December 31
 2018. For the year ended December 31
2018
 the principal sources of cash from our financing activities
consisted of (i) $99.9 million from four public offerings that
resulted in the issuance of an aggregate of 34.7 million shares of
our Common Stock
 (ii) $5.0 million for borrowings under the Siena
Revolver
 and (iii) $4.6 million from a convertible debt financing
in June 2018. These financing cash proceeds totaled $109.5 million
and were partially offset by cash payments for (i) principal paid
under the Siena Revolver of $3.0 million
 (ii) principal and
make-whole premium in August 2018 to repay the convertible debt
financing for $4.9 million
 (iii) payment to terminate our previous
revolver with U.S. Bank for $2.0 million in June 2018
 (iv) payment
of $2.2 million for incremental and direct offering costs
associated with the public offerings
 and (v) payment of debt
issuance costs associated with the Siena Revolver for $0.6
million.




year ended December 31
 2017
 net cash provided by financing
activities was primarily attributable to a public offering in
February 2017 that resulted net proceeds of $15.4 million for the
issuance of an aggregate of 4.9 million shares of our Common Stock.
The other sources of cash from our financing activities in 2017
resulted in cash proceeds of $2.0 million from the U.S. Bank
Revolver that was entered into in July 2017
 and proceeds from the
exercise of warrants for $0.1 million. These sources of cash from
financing activities total $17.5 million and were partially offset
by (i)&#xA0;principal payments to repay a previous revolving line
of credit for $5.7 million
 (ii)&#xA0;principal payments of $4.8
million under a mortgage that was repaid upon the sale of our
building in Denver
 Colorado
 (iii)&#xA0;principal payments of $4.5
million under a note payable to the former owners of Xing Beverage
LLC that was acquired in 2016
 and (iv) principal payments on other
installment notes payable of $0.6 million.

(1)
Represents
the fair value of earnout consideration under the Series D
Preferred Stock as discussed further in Note 3 to the consolidated
financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. The cash
payment is due in the second quarter of 2020.

























(2)
Represents
the fair value of earnout consideration related to the Marley
acquisition as discussed further in Note 3 to the consolidated
financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. The
one-time cash payment of $1.25 million is required at such time as
revenue for the Marley reporting unit is equal to or greater than
$15.0 million during any trailing twelve calendar month period
after the closing. Payment for 50% of the $1.25 million is due
within 15 days after the month in which the earnout payment is
triggered
 25% is payable one year after the first payment
 and the
remaining 25% is payable two years after the first payment. The
timing of payment is based on our current expectations that the net
revenue threshold will be triggered during the year ending December
31
 2021.







(3)
Represents
Excess Working Capital payments to Morinda&#x2019;s stockholders as
discussed further in Note 3 to the consolidated financial
statements included in Item 8 of this Report. The cash payment is
due for $1.0 million in April 2019
 $8.0 million in July 2019
 and
the remainder of $5.5 million is payable in July 2020.







(4)
As
discussed further in Note 3 to the consolidated financial
statements included in Item 8 of this Report
 Morinda agreed to pay
its former stockholders up to $25.0 million from the net proceeds
of a sale leaseback financing event to be completed after the
Closing Date. The closing for this financing occurred on March 22
2019
 whereby the entire $25.0 million will be payable to
Morinda&#x2019;s former stockholders during the second quarter of
2019.






(5)
While the Siena
Revolver was not scheduled to mature until August 2021
 we
terminated the facility on March 29
 2019. Accordingly
 all amounts
due are shown in 2019 and for purposes of the calculation of
interest expense and the early termination penalty
 the payments
shown give effect to the termination on March 29
 2019. As
discussed in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements
included in Item 8 of this Report the Siena Revolver was replaced
with a new Loan Agreement for $25.0 million with East West Bank
which is excluded from this table since it was entered into on
March 29
 2019.







(6)
Consists of base
salary payable to five individuals under employment agreements that
renew annually for successive one-year terms
 unless terminated by
either party.








Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements




the periods presented
 we did not have any relationships with
unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships
 such as
structured finance or special purpose entities
 which were
balance sheet
arrangements.




Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and
Estimates




management&#x2019;s discussion and analysis of financial condition
and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial
statements
 which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation
of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
as well as the reported net revenue and expenses during the
reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed for
changes in facts and circumstances
 and material changes in these
estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other factors that we believe
are reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the
period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.




believe that of our significant accounting policies that are
described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements
included in Item 8 of this Report
 the following accounting
policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity.
Accordingly
 these are the policies we believe are the most
critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our
consolidated financial condition and results of
operations.&#xA0;




Goodwill and&#xA0;Intangible Assets



represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses
over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets
acquired. Goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful
lives are not amortized but tested for impairment annually or more
frequently when events or circumstances indicates that the carrying
value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its fair
value. The goodwill impairment test is applied by performing a
qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the
reporting unit. If
 on the basis of qualitative factors
 it is
considered more likely than not that the fair value of the
reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount
 further testing
of goodwill for impairment is not required. If the carrying amount
of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit&#x2019;s fair value
an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess
limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting
unit.


&#xA0;

















intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at
the estimated acquisition date fair value. Finite lived intangible
assets are amortized over the shorter of the contractual life or
their estimated useful life using the straight-line method
 which
is determined by identifying the period over which the cash flows
from the asset are expected to be generated.




Impairment of Long-lived Assets



are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Impairment exists for property and equipment and
identifiable intangible assets if the carrying amounts of such
assets exceed the estimates of future net undiscounted cash flows
expected to be generated by such assets. An impairment charge is
recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the
asset
 or asset group
 exceeds its fair value.




Revenue Recognition



recognize revenue when our performance obligations are satisfied.
Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sale of
beverage products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of
products to our customers
 which is also when control is
transferred. Merchandising activities that are performed after a
customer obtains control of the product
 are accounted for as
fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver
product to our customers and are recorded in selling
 general and
administrative expenses. Merchandising activities are immaterial in
the context of our contracts.



transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based
on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return.
However
 our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to
remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store
shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and
freshness they expect. Similarly
 our policy for certain
warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and
out-of-date products. As a result
 we record reserves
 based on
estimates
 for anticipated damaged and out-of-date
products.




received for undelivered or back-ordered products are recorded as
deferred revenue. Our policy is to defer revenue related to
distributor convention fees
 payments received on products ordered
in the current period but not delivered until the subsequent
period
 initial independent product consultants
(&#x201C;IPCs&#x201D;) fees
 IPC renewal fees and internet
subscription fees until the products or services have been
provided.




Stock-Based Compensation



measure the cost of employee and director services received in
exchange for all equity awards granted
 including stock options
based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date.
We compute the fair value of options using the Black-Scholes-Merton
(&#x201C;BSM&#x201D;) option pricing model. We recognize the cost of
the equity awards over the period that services are provided to
earn the award
 usually the vesting period. For awards granted
which contain a graded vesting schedule
 and the only condition for
vesting is a service condition
 compensation cost is recognized as
an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
period as if the award was
 in substance
 a single award. We
recognize the impact of forfeitures in the period that the
forfeiture occurs
 rather than estimating the number of awards that
are not expected to vest in accounting for stock-based
compensation.




&#xA0;Income Taxes



account for income taxes under the asset and liability method.
Under this method
 deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax
bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax
rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Realization of
deferred income tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income.
A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of a deferred income tax asset will not be
realized based on the weight of available evidence
 including
expected future earnings.




recognize an uncertain tax position in our financial statements
when we conclude that a tax position is more likely than not to be
sustained upon examination based solely on its technical merits.
Only after a tax position passes the first step of recognition will
measurement be required. Under the measurement step
 the tax
benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more
likely than not to be realized upon effective settlement. This is
determined on a cumulative probability basis. The full impact of
any change in recognition or measurement is reflected in the period
in which such change occurs. Interest and penalties related to
income taxes are recognized in the provision for income
taxes.


&#xA0;

















Recent Accounting Pronouncements




time to time
 new accounting pronouncements are issued by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#x201C;FASB&#x201D;) or other
standard setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified
effective date. Unless otherwise discussed
 we believe that the
impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will
not have a material impact on our financial position or results of
operations upon adoption.&#xA0;




additional information on recently issued accounting standards and
our plans for adoption of those standards
 please refer to the


statements included in Item 8 of this Report.




Non-GAAP Financial Measures




provide investors and others with additional information regarding
our results
 we have disclosed certain non-GAAP financial measures
as follows:



 is net
revenue plus deductions for discounts and allowances (net of
recoveries). Gross revenue is a key operational metric for our
business because this is how we believe investors and competitors
measure us and other beverage companies as with additional scale
distributors and retails will have less ability to force discounts
and allowances on smaller companies in the market which will help
identify our full value to an investor
 competitor or potential
acquire.



is
net loss adjusted to exclude interest expense
 income tax expense
and depreciation and amortization expense.



Adjusted
is EBITDA
adjusted to exclude business combination expenses
 stock-based
compensation expense
 losses on changes in the fair value of
embedded derivatives
 other non-operating income and expenses
 and
gains and losses from the sale of long-lived assets.




primary purpose of using non-GAAP financial measures is to provide
supplemental information that we believe may prove useful to
investors and to enable investors to evaluate our results in the
same way we do. We also present the non-GAAP financial measures
because we believe they assist investors in comparing our
performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis
 as well
as comparing our results against the results of other companies
 by
excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core
operating performance. Specifically
 we use these non-GAAP measures
as measures of operating performance; to prepare our annual
operating budget; to allocate resources to enhance the financial
performance of our business; to evaluate the effectiveness of our
business strategies; to provide consistency and comparability with
past financial performance; to facilitate a comparison of our
results with those of other companies
 many of which use similar
non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results; and
in communications with our board of directors concerning our
financial performance. Investors should be aware however
 that not
all companies define these non-GAAP measures
consistently.




















provide in the tables below a reconciliation from the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measure to each non-GAAP financial
measure presented. Due to a valuation allowance for our deferred
tax assets
 there were no income tax effects associated with any of
our non-GAAP adjustments. The calculation of our Non-GAAP Financial
Measures is presented below for the years ended December 31
 2018
and 2017:

gross revenue
 we exclude selling discounts and allowances when
evaluating the gross amount of our revenue. Our gross revenue is an
important metric because this is how we believe investors and
competitors measure us and other beverage companies since with
additional scale distributors and retailers will have less ability
to force discounts and allowances on smaller companies in the
market
 which will help identify our full value to an investor
competitor or potential acquirer.





(loss) adjusted to exclude GAAP amounts for interest expense
income tax expense
 and depreciation and amortization expense. For
the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA
 we also exclude the following
items for the periods presented:



Financial advisory fees
 due diligence costs and other professional
fees incurred in connection with business combinations are
excluded
 them since they do not relate to our core business
activities.





















: Our
compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation
to attract and retain employees
 directors and consultants. This
strategy is principally aimed at aligning the employee interests
with those of our stockholders and to achieve long-term employee
retention
 rather than to motivate or reward operational
performance for any particular period. As a result
 stock-based
compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally
unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any
particular period.


Loss on Change in Fair Value of Embedded

features that were determined to be embedded derivatives requiring
bifurcation and accounting as separate financial instruments. We
have excluded this loss related to the changes in fair value of
embedded derivatives given the nature of the fair value
requirements. We are not able to manage these amounts as part of
our business operations nor are the losses part of our core
business activities
 so we have excluded them.



Other non-operating income and expenses are excluded since they
typically do not relate to our core business
activities.



Gain from the Sale of Long-lived

assets are excluded since they do not relate to our core business
activities.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm






Board of Directors and Stockholders


Beverages Corporation




Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements




audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of New Age
Beverages Corporation (the Company) as of December 31
 2018 and
2017
 and the related consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive loss
 stockholders&#x2019; equity
 and cash flows for
each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31
 2018
and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial
statements). In our opinion
 the financial statements present
fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the
Company as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year
period ended December 31
 2018
 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.




Basis for Opinion




financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#x2019;s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company&#x2019;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a
public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.




conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to
perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
As part of our audits
 we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting
 but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company&#x2019;s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly
 we express no such opinion.




audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of
material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to
error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those
risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America (&#x201C;U.S. GAAP&#x201D;). All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated.




Emerging Growth Company



accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and related
footnotes have been prepared in accordance with applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
The Company is an &#x201C;emerging
growth company
&#x201D; as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities
Act
 as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012
(the &#x201C;JOBS Act&#x201D;)
 and it may take advantage of certain
exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable
to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies
including
 but not limited to
 not being required to comply with
the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the &#x201C;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#x201D;)
reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation
and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding
advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of
any golden parachute payments not previously approved.













NEW AGE BEVERAGES CORPORATION &#xA0;



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies
from being required to comply with new or revised financial
accounting standards until private companies (that is
 those that
have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared
effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &#x201C;Exchange
Act&#x201D;)) are required to comply with the new or revised
financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a
company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and
comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth
companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The
Company previously elected to opt out of such extended transition
period which means that the Company must adopt new or revised
accounting standards at the same time public companies are required
to adopt the new or revised standard. The Company currently expects
to retain its status as an emerging growth company until the year
ending December 31
 2021
 but this status could end sooner under
certain circumstances.




Reclassifications



amounts in the 2017 financial statements have been reclassified to
conform to the current period financial statement presentation.
These reclassifications had no effect on the previously reported
net loss
 working capital
 cash flows and stockholders&#x2019;
equity.




NOTE 2 &#x2014; SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




Use of Estimates



preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in
conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make judgments
assumptions
 and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The
Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts
historical experience
 and various other factors that it believes
are reasonable under the circumstances
 to determine the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. The Company&#x2019;s significant accounting estimates
include
 but are not necessarily limited to
 estimated useful lives
for identifiable intangible assets and property and equipment

assets

 warrants



inventory obsolescence
 the allowance for sales returns and
chargebacks

allowances
 and the evaluation and measurement of contingencies. To
the extent there are material differences between the
Company&#x2019;s estimates and the actual results
 the
Company&#x2019;s future consolidated results of operation will be
affected.




Risks and Uncertainties



in the Company&#x2019;s business are various risks and
uncertainties
 including its limited operating history in a rapidly
changing industry. These risks include the Company&#x2019;s ability
to manage its rapid growth and its ability to attract new customers
and expand sales to existing customers
 risks related to
litigation
 as well as other risks and uncertainties. In the event
that the Company does not successfully execute its business plan
certain assets may not be recoverable
 certain liabilities may not
be paid and investments in its capital stock may not be
recoverable. The Company&#x2019;s success depends upon the
acceptance of its expertise in providing services
 development of
sales and distribution channels
 and its ability to generate
significant net revenue and cash flows from the use of this
expertise.




Segments



Company&#x2019;s chief operating decision maker (the
&#x201C;CODM&#x201D;)
 who is the Company&#x2019;s Chief Executive
Officer
 allocates resources and assesses performance based on
financial information of the Company. The CODM reviews financial
information presented for each reporting segment for purposes of
making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.
Accordingly
 the Company operates in two reportable segments as
presented in Note 15.




Cash and Cash Equivalents



highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of
three months or less that are freely available for the
Company&#x2019;s immediate and general business use are classified
as cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist
primarily of demand deposits with financial
institutions.













NEW AGE BEVERAGES CORPORATION &#xA0;



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






Allowance for Doubtful Accounts



Company records a provision for doubtful accounts based on
historical experience and a detailed assessment of the
collectability of its accounts receivable. In estimating the
allowance for doubtful accounts
 the Company considers
 among other
factors
 the aging of the accounts receivable
 its historical
write-offs
 the credit worthiness of customers
 and general
economic conditions. Account balances are charged against the
allowance when the Company believes that it is probable that the
receivable will not be recovered. Actual write-offs may either be
in excess or less than the estimated allowance. Recoveries of any
accounts receivable previously written off are recorded as a
reduction of expense when received.




Inventories



consist of the costs associated with the purchase of raw materials
and the manufacturing and transportation of products. Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the
first-in
 first-out method. Provisions for excess inventory are
included in cost of goods sold and have historically been
immaterial.&#xA0;




Property and Equipment



and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets
as follows:











Years





Buildings and improvements




28-40





Machinery and equipment




3-7





Office furniture and equipment




3-10





Delivery vehicles




3-5







improvements are amortized over the remaining lease term or the
estimated useful life of the asset
 whichever is shorter. As of
December 31
 2018
 leasehold improvements are being amortized over
lives ranging from 1 to 10 years. Maintenance and repairs are
expensed as incurred. Depreciation commences when assets are
initially placed into service for their intended use.




Goodwill and&#xA0;Intangible Assets



Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired
businesses over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net
assets acquired. Goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite
useful lives are not amortized but tested for impairment annually
or more frequently when events or circumstances indicates that the
carrying value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its
fair value. The goodwill impairment test is applied by performing a
qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the
reporting unit. If
 on the basis of qualitative factors
 it is
considered more likely than not that the fair value of the
reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount
 further testing
of goodwill for impairment is not required. If the carrying amount
of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit&#x2019;s fair value
an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess
limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting
unit. The Company performed a qualitative assessment and determined
there was no impairment of goodwill for the years ended December
31
 2018 and 2017.


&#xA0;


Intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at
the estimated acquisition date fair value. Finite lived intangible
assets are amortized over the shorter of the contractual life or
their estimated useful life using the straight-line method
 which
is determined by identifying the period over which the cash flows
from the asset are expected to be generated.













NEW AGE BEVERAGES CORPORATION &#xA0;



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






In connection with the Company&#x2019;s business combinations
identifiable intangible assets were acquired that were recorded at
estimated fair value on the date of acquisition. These assets are
being amortized using the straight-line method over the
amortization periods shown below:











Number of Years














Weighted









Range





Average




License
agreements













China
direct selling license



















Trade
names









Manufacturing
processes and recipes









Independent
product consultants distribution network









Customer
relationships



















Non-compete
agreements
















(1)
In order to more closely reflect the estimated
economic life of the license agreement acquired in the June 2017
acquisition of Marley
 the Company revised the estimated useful
life from 42 years to 15 years during the fourth quarter of 2018.
The carrying value of this license was approximately $5.7 million
and the impact of the change in estimate resulted in an additional
$64
000 of amortization expense for the fourth quarter of
whereby
the change to earnings per share was immaterial. For the year
ending December 31
 2019
 total amortization expense related to
this license agreement is expected to be approximately $0.4 million
as compared to approximately $0.2 million that was recognized for
the year ended December 31
 2018.





Impairment of Long-lived Assets



assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Impairment exists for property and equipment and other
long-lived assets if the carrying amounts of such assets exceed the
estimates of future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be
generated by such assets. An impairment charge is recognized for
the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
 or asset
group
 exceeds its fair value. No impairment of long-lived assets
occurred in the years presented.




Leases



Company determines if contractual arrangements are considered a
lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating
lease right-of-use (&#x201C;ROU&#x201D;) assets
 whereas assets
related to finance leases are included in property and equipment.
The corresponding liabilities related to ROU assets and assets
under financing leases are included in accrued liabilities and
other long-term liabilities in the Company&#x2019;s consolidated
balance sheets
 based on the related contractual maturities. ROU
assets represent the Company&#x2019;s right to use an underlying
asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the
related obligations to make lease payments arising from the lease.
Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the
lease commencement date based on the present value of lease
payments over the lease term. None of the Company&#x2019;s leases
provide an implicit interest rate
 which requires use of the
Company&#x2019;s estimated incremental borrowing rate to determine
the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU asset
also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease
incentives.




lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease that
are reasonably certain to be exercised
 the ROU calculations give
effect to such options. Lease expense for lease payments is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Some of
the Company&#x2019;s lease agreements contain lease and non-lease
components
 which are generally accounted for separately. However
for certain leases
 the Company elects to account for the lease and
non-lease components as a single lease component. Additionally
 for
certain equipment leases
 the Company applies a portfolio approach
to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and
liabilities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






Debt Issuance Costs and Discounts



issuance costs incurred to obtain new debt financing or modify
existing debt financing consist of incremental direct costs
incurred for professional fees and due diligence services
including reimbursement of similar costs incurred by the lenders.
Amounts paid to the lenders when a financing is consummated are a
reduction of the proceeds and are treated as a debt discount.
Except for revolving lines of credit
 debt issuance costs and
discounts are presented in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets as a reduction in the carrying value of the debt and are
accreted to interest expense using the effective interest method.
Debt issuance costs related to revolving lines of credit are
presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a
long-term asset and are amortized using the straight-line method
over the contractual term of the debt agreement. Unamortized
deferred debt issuance costs are not charged to expense when the
related debt becomes a demand obligation due to the violation of
terms so long as it is probable that the lenders will either waive
the violation or will agree to amend or restructure the terms of
the indebtedness. If either circumstance is probable
 the deferred
debt issuance costs continue to be amortized over the remaining
term of the initial amortization period. If it is not probable
 the
costs will be charged to expense.




Deferred Offering Costs



legal fees and other costs that are directly associated with equity
offerings are capitalized as deferred offering costs
 pending a
determination of the success of the offering. Deferred offering
costs related to successful offerings are charged to additional
paid-in capital in the period it is determined that the offering
was successful. Deferred offering costs related to unsuccessful
equity offerings are recorded as expense in the period when it is
determined that an offering is unsuccessful.




Revenue Recognition



recognize revenue when our performance obligations are satisfied.
Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sale of
beverage products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of
products to our customers
 which is also when control is
transferred. Merchandising activities that are performed after a
customer obtains control of the product
 are accounted for as
fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver
product to our customers and are recorded in selling
 general and
administrative expenses. Merchandising activities are immaterial in
the context of our contracts.



transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based
on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return.
However
 our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to
remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store
shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and
freshness they expect. Similarly
 our policy for certain
warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and
out-of-date products. As a result
 we record reserves
 based on
estimates
 for anticipated damaged and out-of-date
products.



Revenue consists of the gross sales price
 less estimated returns
and allowances for which provisions are made at the time of sale
and less certain other discounts
 allowances
 and personal rebates
that are accounted for as a reduction from gross revenue. Shipping
and handling charges that are billed to customers are included as a
component of revenue. Costs incurred by the Company for shipping
and handling charges are included in cost of goods
sold.




Payments received for undelivered or back-ordered products are
recorded as deferred revenue. The Company&#x2019;s policy is to
defer revenue related to distributor convention fees
 payments
received on products ordered in the current period but not
delivered until the subsequent period
 initial independent product
consultants (&#x201C;IPCs&#x201D;) fees
 IPC renewal fees and
internet subscription fees until the products or services have been
provided. Deferred revenue is included in accrued liabilities in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.




Customer Programs and Incentives



The Company incurs customer program costs to promote sales of
products and to maintain competitive pricing.&#xA0; Amounts paid in
connection with customer programs and incentives are recorded as
reductions to revenue or as advertising
 promotional and selling
expenses
based on the nature
of the expenditure. The Company accounts for volume rebates made to
its independent product consultants (&#x201C;IPCs&#x201D;) and
similar discounts and incentives as a reduction of revenue in the
accompanying consolidated statements of
operations.













NEW AGE BEVERAGES CORPORATION &#xA0;



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






Sales and Marketing Expenses



Advertising
 promotional and selling expenses consisted of sales
salaries
 tap handles
 media advertising costs
 sales and marketing
expenses
 and promotional activity expenses and are recognized in
The Company accrues expenses for incentive trips
associated with Morinda&#x2019;s direct sales marketing program
which rewards certain IPCs with paid attendance at its conventions
meetings
 and retreats. Expenses associated with incentive trips
are accrued over qualification periods as they are earned. The
Company specifically analyzes incentive trip accruals based on
historical and current sales trends as well as contractual
obligations when evaluating the adequacy of the incentive trip
accrual. Actual results could result in liabilities being more or
less than the amounts recorded.


&#xA0;


Research and Development



Research and development costs are primarily related to development
of new product formulas. All research and development costs are
expensed as incurred. Research and development costs were not
material for the years ended December 31
 2018 and
2017.




Stock-Based Compensation



Company measures the cost of employee and director services
received in exchange for all equity awards granted
 including stock
options
 based on the fair market value of the award as of the
grant date. The Company computes the fair value of options using
the Black-Scholes-Merton (&#x201C;BSM&#x201D;) option pricing model.
The Company recognizes the cost of the equity awards over the
period that services are provided to earn the award
 usually the
vesting period. For awards granted which contain a graded vesting
schedule
 and the only condition for vesting is a service
condition
 compensation cost is recognized as an expense on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period as if the
award was
 in substance
 a single award. The Company recognizes the
impact of forfeitures in the period that the forfeiture occurs
rather than estimating the number of awards that are not expected
to vest in accounting for stock-based compensation.




Derivatives



Company holds a derivative financial instrument in the form of an
interest rate swap. The Company uses interest rate swaps to
economically convert variable interest rate debt on a foreign
mortgage to a fixed rate. The Company has not designated these
derivatives as hedging instruments. The interest rate swaps are
recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements at
their fair value with the unrealized gains and losses recorded in
interest expense.













NEW AGE BEVERAGES CORPORATION &#xA0;



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






the Company enters into a financial instrument such as a debt or
equity agreement (the &#x201C;host contract&#x201D;)
 the Company
assesses whether the economic characteristics of any embedded
features are clearly and closely related to the primary economic
characteristics of the remainder of the host contract. When it is
determined that (i) an embedded feature possesses economic
characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the
primary economic characteristics of the host contract
 and (ii) a
separate
 stand-alone instrument with the same terms would meet the
definition of a financial derivative instrument
 then the embedded
feature is bifurcated from the host contract and accounted for as a
derivative instrument. The estimated fair value of the derivative
feature is recorded separately from the carrying value of the host
contract
 with subsequent changes in the estimated fair value
recorded as a non-operating gain or loss in the Company&#x2019;s
consolidated statements of operations.




Income Taxes



Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability
method. Under this method
 deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on differences between financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured
using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect
when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
Realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon future
taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred income tax
asset will not be realized based on the weight of available
evidence
 including expected future earnings.




Company recognizes an uncertain tax position in its financial
statements when it concludes that a tax position is more likely
than not to be sustained upon examination based solely on its
technical merits. Only after a tax position passes the first step
of recognition will measurement be required. Under the measurement
step
 the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit
that is more likely than not to be realized upon effective
settlement. This is determined on a cumulative probability basis.
The full impact of any change in recognition or measurement is
reflected in the period in which such change occurs. Interest and
penalties related to income taxes are recognized in the provision
for income taxes.




Foreign Currency Translation



Company&#x2019;s reporting currency is the U.S.&#xA0;Dollar
 while
the functional currencies of its foreign subsidiaries are their
respective local currencies. A majority of Morinda&#x2019;s business
operations occur outside the United States. The local currency of
each of the Morinda&#x2019;s international subsidiaries and branches
is used as its functional currency. All assets and liabilities are
translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates existing at the
consolidated balance sheet date
 and net revenue and expenses are
translated at monthly average exchange rates. The resulting net
foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of
stockholders&#x2019; equity in the consolidated balance sheets.
Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and
remeasurement gains (losses) on short-term intercompany borrowings
are recorded in other income and expense in the consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The tax effect has
not been material to date.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements




accounting standards were adopted during fiscal year
2018:




2014
 the FASB issued ASU No.&#xA0;2014-09
 
which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition standards
under U.S. GAAP. The new standard provides a five-step process for
recognizing revenue that depicts the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those

this ASU using the full retrospective method effective January 1
2018. The impact of adoption of this ASU was immaterial and
accordingly
 there were no changes to the previously issued
financial statements for the year ended December 31
2017.



In August 2016
 the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (&#x201C;FASB&#x201D;) issued Accounting Standards Update
(&#x201C;ASU&#x201D;) No. 2016-15
Statement of Cash Flows
Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
The new standard
is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash
receipts and cash payments are classified in the statements of cash

reporting period presented upon initial adoption. ASU 2016-15 was
adopted effective January 1
 2018 and did not have a material
impact on the Company&#x2019;s consolidated financial statements for
the years ended December 31

 there were no transactions that
required retrospective adjustments in the consolidated statements
of cash flows for the year ended December 31
2017.



In November 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-18
Statement of Cash&#xA0;Flows
&#x2013; Restricted Cash
 which
requires entities that have restricted cash or restricted cash
equivalents to reconcile the change during the period in the total
cash
 cash equivalents
 and amounts generally described as
restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents in its statement of
cash flows. As a result
 amounts generally described as cash and
restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash
equivalents shown on the statement of cash flows. The Company
adopted this standard during 2018 using the retrospective
transition method. The adoption did not result in any changes to
the Company&#x2019;s previously reported consolidated statements of
cash flows for the year ended December 31
2017.



In May 2017
 the
FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09


 which provides clarification on
when modification accounting should be used for changes to the
terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. This standard
does not change the accounting for modifications of share-based
payment awards but clarifies that modification accounting guidance
should only be applied if there is a change to the value
 vesting
conditions
 or award classification and would not be required if
the changes are considered non-substantive. This standard was
adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and did
not have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements.





following accounting standards are not yet effective; management
has not completed its evaluation to determine the impact that
adoption of these standards will have on the Company&#x2019;s
consolidated financial statements.

 ASC 842.&#xA0; &#xA0;The Company has not yet
determined the effect that ASU 2018-19 will have on its results
operations
 balance sheets or financial statement
disclosures.



January 2017
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04
- Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying

simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step
2 from the goodwill impairment test and eliminating the requirement
for a reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to
perform a qualitative assessment. Instead
 under this ASU
 an
entity would perform its annual
 or interim
 goodwill impairment
test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its
carrying amount and would recognize an impairment charge for the
amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting
unit&#x2019;s fair value; however
 the loss recognized is not to
exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting
unit. In addition
 income tax effects will be considered
 if
applicable. This ASU is effective for fiscal years
 and interim
periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December 15
2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures.




NOTE 3 &#x2014; BUSINESS COMBINATIONS




Company completed business combinations with Morinda in December
2018
 and Maverick
 PMC and Marley during 2017. Each of these
business combinations was accounted for using the acquisition
method of accounting based on ASC 805
&#xA0;
 and using the
fair value concepts set forth in ASC&#xA0;820
. The key terms
of each of these business combinations are discussed
below.




Morinda Holdings
 Inc.



December 2
 2018
 the Company entered into a Plan of Merger (the
&#x201C;Merger Agreement&#x201D;) with Morinda and New Age Health
Sciences Holdings
 Inc.
 a newly formed Utah corporation and
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (&#x201C;Merger Sub&#x201D;).
On December 21
 2018 (the &#x201C;Closing Date&#x201D;)
 the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were completed.
Merger Sub was merged with and into Morinda and Morinda became a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. This transaction is
referred to herein as the &#x201C;Merger.&#x201D;




to the Merger Agreement
 the Company paid to Morinda&#x2019;s equity
holders (i) $75.0 million in cash; (ii) 2
016
480 shares of the
Company&#x2019;s Common Stock with an estimated fair value on the
closing Date of approximately $11.0 million
 (iii) 43
804 shares of
Series D Preferred Stock (the &#x201C;Preferred Stock&#x201D;)
providing for the potential payment of up to $15 million contingent
upon Morinda achieving certain post-closing milestones
 as
discussed below.&#xA0;




to the Certificate of Designations of Series D Preferred Stock (the
&#x201C;CoD&#x201D;)
 the holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled
to receive a dividend of up to an aggregate of $15.0 million (the
&#x201C;Milestone Dividend&#x201D;) if the Adjusted EBITDA (as
defined in the CoD) of Morinda is at least $20.0 million for the
year ending December 31
 2019. The Milestone Dividend is payable on
April 15
 2020. If the Adjusted EBITDA of Morinda is less than
$20.0 million
 the Milestone Dividend shall be reduced by applying
a five-times multiple to the difference between the Adjusted EBITDA
target of $20 million and actual Adjusted EBITDA for the year
ending December 31
 2019. Accordingly
 no Milestone Dividend is
payable if actual Adjusted EBITDA is $17.0 million or lower.
Additionally
 the Company is required to pay quarterly dividends to
the holders of the Preferred Stock at a rate of 1.5% per annum of

 payable
on a pro rata basis. The Company may pay the Milestone Dividend and
/or the annual dividend in cash or in kind
 provided that if the
Company chooses to pay in kind


registered under the Securities Act of 1933
 as amended (the
&#x201C;Securities Act&#x201D;). The Preferred Stock shall terminate
on April 15
 2020.




Prior to the Merger
 Morinda was an S corporation for U.S. federal
and state income tax purposes. Accordingly
 Morinda&#x2019;s taxable
earnings were reported on the individual income tax returns of the
stockholders who were responsible for payment of the related income
tax liabilities.&#xA0;In December 2018
 Morinda agreed to
distribute to its stockholders approximately $39.6 million of its
previously-taxed S corporation earnings whereby distributions are
payable (i)&#xA0;up to $25.0 million for which the timing and
amount are subject to a future financing event
 and
(ii)&#xA0;approximately $14.6 million based on the calculation
of&#xA0;excess working capital (&#x201C;EWC&#x201D;)&#xA0;as of the
Closing Date. EWC is the amount by which Morinda&#x2019;s actual
working capital (as defined in the Merger Agreement) on the Closing
Date exceeds $25.0 million.&#xA0;The Closing Date balance sheet of
Morinda indicated that EWC was approximately $14.6 million as of
the Closing Date

Based on the report
of an independent valuation specialist
 the fair value of
work-in-process and finished goods inventories on the Closing Date
exceeded the historical carrying value by approximately $2.2
million. This amount represents an element of built-in profit on
the Closing Date and will be charged to cost of goods sold as the
related inventories are sold
 which is expected to occur within
approximately six months after the Closing Date. The fair value of
inventories was determined using both the &#x201C;cost
approach&#x201D; and the &#x201C;market approach&#x201D;.














NEW AGE BEVERAGES CORPORATION &#xA0;



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS








(2)
Fair value of
Morinda&#x2019;s real estate properties amounted to $44.4 million
and was based upon real estate appraisals prepared by an
independent firm
 primarily using the &#x201C;income
approach&#x201D;. Fair value of other property and equipment
amounted to $10.9 million and was based primarily on the report of
an independent valuation specialist with fair value determined
using both the &#x201C;cost approach&#x201D; and the &#x201C;market
approach&#x201D;.







(3)
The fair value of
identifiable intangible assets was $45.9 million and was determined
based on the report of an independent valuation specialist
primarily using variations of the &#x201C;income approach
&#x201D;
which is based on the present value of the future after-tax cash
flows attributable to each identifiable intangible
asset.&#xA0;







(4)
In order to conform
with the Company&#x2019;s accounting policies
 Morinda adopted ASU
No. 2016-02
&#xA0;
which requires that assets and liabilities be recognized on the
balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by those
leases.&#xA0;Accordingly
 operating lease right of use assets of
$13.4 million were recognized.







(5)
Morinda&#x2019;s
U.S. operations were previously taxed as a subchapter S Corporation
whereby no deferred income tax assets or liabilities had been
recognized for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Upon
consummation of the Merger
 Morinda&#x2019;s U.S. operations are
included in the consolidated income tax returns of the Company.
Accordingly
 an adjustment of approximately $9.9 million has been
reflected for net deferred income tax liabilities that resulted
from differences between the financial reporting basis and the
income tax basis of such U.S. assets and liabilities.







(6)
Goodwill related to
Morinda is recognized for the difference between the total
consideration transferred to consummate the Merger of $99.1 million
and the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired of $88.8
million. Goodwill and intangible assets in connection with the
Morinda business cominbation are not expected to be deductible for
income tax purposes.

using an option pricing model and will continue to be adjusted to
fair value each quarter during 2019 as additional information
becomes available.






(4)
Pursuant
to a separate agreement between the parties
 Morinda agreed to pay
its former stockholders up to $25.0 million from the net proceeds
of a sale leaseback to be completed after the Closing Date. As
discussed in Note 16
 the closing for this transaction occured on
March 22
 2019. Accordingly
 since this payment was made from the
proceeds of a long-term financing
 the net carrying value is
classified as a long-term liability in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31
 2018.






(5)
Interest
was imputed on these obligations based on a credit and tax adjusted
interest rate of 6.1% for the period from the Closing Date until
the respective contractual or estimated payment dates. This
discount is being accreted using the effective interest

January 10
 2017
 the Company entered into an agreement with an
unaffiliated third party resulting in the sale for $8.9 million of
the land and building that serves as the Company&#x2019;s corporate
headquarters in Denver
 Colorado. Concurrently with the sale
 the
Company entered into a lease of this property for an initial term
of ten years
 with two options to extend for successive five-year
periods. The monthly lease cost is $52
000 for the initial year
with 2% annual increases for each year thereafter. The Company
determined that this transaction qualified as a sale under ASU
&#x201D;)
 which the Company
adopted effective January 1
 2017. Therefore
 a gain of
approximately $3.3 million was recognized for the year ended
December 31
 2017. In connection with the leaseback
 the Company
recognized an ROU lease asset and a corresponding ROU lease
liability for approximately $4.3 million. The present value of the
ROU lease liability was based on the Company&#x2019;s implicit
borrowing rate of 10.0% on the closing date.

Siena Revolver



On August 10
 2018 (the &#x201C;Closing Date&#x201D;)
 the Company
entered into a loan and security agreement with Siena Lending Group
LLC (&#x201C;Siena&#x201D;) that provides for a $12.0 million
revolving credit facility (the &#x201C;Siena Revolver&#x201D;) with a
scheduled maturity date of August 10
 2021 (the &#x201C;Maturity
Date&#x201D;). Outstanding borrowings bear interest at the greater
of (i) 7.5% or (ii) the prime rate plus 2.75%. As of December 31
2018
 the effective interest rate was 8.25%. Beginning on November
7
 2018
 the Company was required to pay interest on a minimum of
$2.0 million of borrowings
 regardless of whether such funds had
been borrowed. The Siena Revolver also provides for an unused line
fee equal to 0.5% per annum of the undrawn portion of the $12.0
million commitment. The Siena Revolver is subject to availability

 unless a successor is appointed within 60 days
and such successor is reasonably satisfactory to the
Lender.


&#xA0;


In connection with the financing
 the Company incurred a financial
advisor fee
 a closing fee and professional fees for a total of
$0.4 million. This amount is being accounted for as debt issuance
costs that is being amortized using the straight-line method over
the three-year term of the Siena Revolver.













NEW AGE BEVERAGES CORPORATION &#xA0;



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






The Siena Revolver includes a lockbox arrangement that requires the
Company to direct its customers to remit payments to a restricted
bank account
 whereby all available funds are used to pay down the
outstanding principal balance under the Siena Revolver.
Accordingly
 the entire outstanding principal balance of the Siena
Revolver is classified as a current liability as of December 31
As discussed in
Note 16
 the Siena Revolver was paid off and terminated on March
29
 2019.





Embedded Derivatives



The Siena Revolver includes features that were determined to be
embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation and accounting as
separate financial instruments. The Company determined that
embedded derivatives include the requirement to pay (i) an early
termination premium if the Siena Revolver is terminated before the
Maturity Date
 and (ii) default interest at a 5.0% premium if
events of default exist. An early termination premium is required
to be paid if Siena&#x2019;s commitment to make revolving loans is
terminated prior to the Maturity Date. The fee is equal to 4.00%
2.25% and 1.25% of the $12.0 million commitment if termination
occurs during the first
 second and third years after the Closing
Date
 respectively. These embedded derivatives are classified
within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair value was
estimated using the &#x201C;with&#x201D; and &#x201C;without&#x201D;
method. Accordingly
 the Siena Revolver was first valued with the
embedded derivatives (the &#x201C;with&#x201D; scenario) and
subsequently valued without the embedded derivatives (the
&#x201C;without&#x201D; scenario). The fair value of the embedded
derivatives was estimated as the difference between these two
scenarios.&#xA0;The fair values were determined using the income
approach
 specifically the yield method. As of December 31
 2018
key Level 3 assumptions and estimates used in the valuation of the
embedded derivatives included an assessment of the probability of
early termination of the Siena Revolver
 the remaining term to
maturity of approximately 2.6 years
 probability of default of
approximately 10%
 and a discount rate of 6.1%.




As of December 31
 2018
 the embedded derivatives for the Siena
Revolver have an aggregate fair value of approximately $0.5
million
 which is included in accrued liabilities as of December
31
 2018. The Company recognized a loss on change in fair value of
embedded derivatives of $0.5 million which is included in
non-operating expenses for the year ended December 31
2018.

Convertible Note



On June 20
 2018
 the Company issued a Senior Secured Convertible
Promissory Note (the &#x201C;Convertible Note&#x201D;) with a
principal balance of $4.75 million and a maturity date of June 20

 the
Company received net proceeds of $4.6 million. The Company also
issued to the lender an aggregate of 226
190 shares of Common Stock
with a fair value of approximately $0.4 million.&#xA0;These amounts
were accounted for as an aggregate discount of $0.6 million that
was accreted to interest expense using the effective interest
method. On August 24
 2018
 the Company repaid the entire
convertible note by paying an aggregate of approximately $5.0
million
 which consisted of the principal balance of $4.75 million
plus a make-whole penalty for early prepayment of $0.2 million. Due
to the early extinguishment of the Convertible Note
 the Company
recognized accretion for all of the debt discount and issuance
costs of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31
 2018. The
Company has no further obligations related to this convertible
note.

Series B Preferred&#xA0;



Board of Directors previously designated 300
000 shares as Series B
Preferred Stock (&#x201C;Series B Preferred&#x201D;). The Series B
Preferred was non-voting
 not eligible for dividends and ranked
equal to Common Stock and below Series A Preferred in liquidation.

Series C Preferred&#xA0;



September 2018
 the Board of Directors designated 7
000 shares as

 no
shares of Series C Preferred are outstanding and none are
designated for future issuance as of December 31
2018.




Series D Preferred&#xA0;

Stock Options



August 3
 2016
 the Company&#x2019;s approved and implemented the
New Age Beverages Corporation 2016-2017 Long Term Incentive Plan
(the &#x201C;LTI Plan&#x201D;). The LTI Plan provides for stock
options to be granted to employees
 directors and consultants at an
exercise price not less than 100% of the fair value of the
Company&#x2019;s Common Stock on the grant date. The options granted
generally have a maximum term of 10 years from the grant date and
are exercisable upon vesting. Option grants generally vest over a
period between one and three years after the grant date of such
award. As of December 31
 2018
 approximately 0.2 million shares
were available for future grants of stock options
 restricted stock
and similar instruments under the LTI Plan. The number of shares
reserved for grants is adjusted annually on the first day of
January whereby a maximum of 10% of the Company&#x2019;s outstanding
shares of Common Stock are available for grant under the LTI Plan.
Accordingly
 as of January 1
 2019
 an additional 4.0 million
shares of Common Stock became available for future grants under the
LTI Plan.

fair value of each stock option granted under the LTI Plan was

Expected

Based on the assumptions set forth above
 the weighted-average
grant date fair value per share of employee options during the
years ended December&#xA0;31
 2018 and 2017 was $4.05 and $1.11
respectively. The BSM model requires various highly subjective
assumptions that represent management&#x2019;s best estimates of the
fair value of the Company&#x2019;s Common Stock
 volatility
risk-free interest rates
 expected term
 and dividend yield. The
expected term represents the weighted-average period that options
granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to
vesting schedules. Since the Company does not have an extended
history of actual exercises
 the Company has estimated the expected
term using a simplified method which calculates the expected term
as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of
the awards. The Company has never declared or paid cash dividends
and does not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future;
therefore
 the Company used an expected dividend yield of zero. The
risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury rates in effect
during the expected term of the grant. The expected volatility is
based on the historical volatility of the Company&#x2019;s Common
Stock for the period beginning in August 2016 when its shares were
first publicly traded through the grant date of the respective
stock options.

NOTE 10 &#x2014; INCOME TAXES



The Tax Act



December 2017
 the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (&#x201C;Tax
Act&#x201D;) was enacted into law which significantly revises the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended. The newly enacted
federal income tax law
 among other things
 contains significant
changes to corporate taxation
 including a flat corporate tax rate
of 21%
 limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30%
of adjusted taxable income
 limitation of the deduction for newly
generated net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable
income and elimination of net operating loss (&#x201C;NOL&#x201D;)
carrybacks
 future taxation of certain classes of offshore earnings
regardless of whether they are repatriated
 immediate deductions
for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation
expense over time
 and modifying or repealing many business
deductions and credits beginning in 2018.




December&#xA0;31
 2018
 the Company has continued its position to
return all foreign earnings to the U.S. parent company and has
recorded deferred tax liabilities of $850
000 for foreign
withholding taxes associated with foreign retained earnings and
cross-border payments.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






result of the Tax Act
 the corporate tax rate decreased from a top
marginal rate of 35% that was effective through December 31
 2017
to a flat rate of 21% effective January 1
 2018. Accordingly
 a
decrease of $1.4 million in the Company&#x2019;s domestic deferred
income tax assets was recognized as of December 31
 2017
 and this
amount was fully offset by a corresponding decrease in the
valuation allowance.




Morinda Business Combination



the Company acquired Morinda on December 21
 2018
 Morinda&#x2019;s
net earnings taxed for the U.S. and various state jurisdictions
were payable personally by the shareholders pursuant to an election
under Subchapter&#xA0;S of the Internal Revenue Code. The
Subchapter S election terminated upon closing of the business
combination with the Company. Accordingly
 the Company recognized
net deferred income tax liabilities of approximately $9.9 million
for differences between the income tax basis of the assets and
liabilities and the related balances for financial reporting
purposes.




Company is required to pay taxes to the appropriate governmental
entities on profits derived from Morinda&#x2019;s international
operations
 including foreign withholding taxes imposed on the
remittance of earnings of Morinda&#x2019;s foreign subsidiaries and
withholding taxes imposed on royalty payments. The Company has
recorded income tax liabilities for foreign withholding on
distributed earnings. As of December 31
 2018
 the Company has no
undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries that are
indefinitely reinvested. The Company is also responsible for state
income taxes and other taxes assessed at the Company level. The
Company&#x2019;s provision for income taxes includes such
taxes.&#xA0;

year ended December&#xA0;31
 2017 the valuation allowance increased
by $0.7 million
 primarily as a result of the increase in net
operating losses. For the year ended December&#xA0;31
 2018
 the
net decrease in the valuation allowance amounted to $2.9 million
since net operating loss carryforwards were considered to be
realizable due to net deferred tax liabilities related to purchase
accounting. In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax
assets
 management considers whether it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not
be realized.




NOL Carryforwards and Other Matters



December 31
 2018
 the Company has federal NOL carryforwards of
approximately $36.3 million
 of which $24.9 million does not expire
and $11.4 million will begin to expire in 2023. Additionally
 the
Company has varying amounts of NOL carryforwards in the U.S. states
in which it does business that start to expire in 2023. Federal and
state laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of
NOL and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership
change for income tax purposes
 as defined in Section&#xA0;382 of
the Internal Revenue Code.




to Internal Revenue Code (&#x201C;IRC&#x201D;) Section 382
 annual
use of the Company&#x2019;s net operating loss carryforwards may be
limited in the event a cumulative change in ownership of more than
50% occurs within a three-year period. The Company has not
completed an IRC Section 382 analysis regarding the limitation of
net operating loss carryforwards. The Company&#x2019;s ability to
use its remaining net operating loss carryforwards may be further
limited if the Company experiences a Section 382 ownership change
in connection with future changes in the Company&#x2019;s stock
ownership.

unremitted earnings of the Company&#x2019;s foreign subsidiaries.
However
 the Company may still be liable for withholding taxes or
other income taxes that might be incurred upon the repatriation of
foreign earnings. The Company has made a provision for additional
income taxes on undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries
because the Company does not intend to permanently reinvest these
earnings outside the United States.

NOTE 11 &#x2014; COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES



Executive Deferred Compensation Plan



 implemented
an unfunded executive deferred compensation plan in 2009 for
certain executives of Morinda. All financial performance targets
under the plan were achieved as of December 31
 2018
 and a
long-term liability of $4.1 million is included in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. After the executives retire
 the
deferred compensation obligation is payable over a period up to 20
years.




401(k) Plan



has a defined contribution employee benefit plan under section
401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the &#x201C;401(k)
Plan&#x201D;). The 401(k) Plan covers all eligible U.S. employees of
Morinda who are entitled to participate at the beginning of the
first full quarter following commencement of employment. Morinda
matches contributions up to 3% of the participating
employee&#x2019;s compensation. Morinda&#x2019;s matching
contributions vest over four years with 0% vested through the end
of the first year of service and 33% vesting upon completion of
each of the next three years of service. Total contributions by
Morinda to the 401(k) Plan were insignificant for the period from
December 21
 2018 through December 31
 2018. Effective January 1
2019
 the Company extended the right to participate in the 401(k)
Plan to all of the Company&#x2019;s eligible employees.




Foreign Benefit Plans



has an unfunded retirement benefit plan for the Company&#x2019;s
Japanese branch that entitles substantially all employees in Japan
other than directors
 to retirement payments. Morinda also has an
unfunded retirement benefit plan in Indonesia that entitles all
permanent employees to retirement payments.




termination of employment
 the Morinda employees of the Japanese
branch are generally entitled to retirement benefits determined by
reference to basic rates of pay at the time of termination
 years
of service
 and conditions under which the termination occurs. If
the termination is involuntary or caused by retirement at the
mandatory retirement age of 65
 the employee is entitled to a
greater payment than in the case of voluntary termination. Morinda
employees in Indonesia whose service is terminated are generally
entitled to retirement benefits determined by reference to basic
rates of pay at the time of termination
 years of service and
conditions under which the termination occurs. The unfunded benefit
obligation for these defined benefit pension plans was
approximately $3.0 million as of December&#xA0;31
 2018. Of this
amount
 approximately $2.9 million is included in other long-term
liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31

Contingencies



Company&#x2019;s operations are subject to numerous governmental
rules and regulations in each of the countries it does business.
These rules and regulations include a complex array of tax and
customs regulations as well as restrictions on product ingredients
and claims
 the commissions paid to the Company&#x2019;s IPCs
labeling and packaging of products
 conducting business as a
direct-selling business
 and other facets of manufacturing and
selling products. In some instances
 the rules and regulations may
not be fully defined under the law or are otherwise unclear in
their application. Additionally
 laws and regulations can change
from time to time
 as can their interpretation by the courts
administrative bodies
 and the tax and customs authorities in each
country. The Company actively seeks to be in compliance
 in all
material respects
 with the laws of each of the countries in which
it does business and expects its IPCs to do the same. The
Company&#x2019;s operations are often subject to review by local
country tax and customs authorities and inquiries from other
governmental agencies. No assurance can be given that the
Company&#x2019;s compliance with governmental rules and regulations
will not be challenged by the authorities or that such challenges
will not result in assessments or required changes in the
Company&#x2019;s business that could have a material impact on its
business
 consolidated financial statements and cash
flow.




Company has various non-income tax contingencies in several
countries. Such exposure could be material depending upon the
ultimate resolution of each situation. As of December&#xA0;31
2018
 the Company has recorded a current liability under Accounting
Standards Codification (ASC)&#xA0;450
 
 of approximately $0.8
million.

time to time
 the Company may be a party to litigation and subject
to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Although the
results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with
certainty
 the Company currently believes that the final outcome of
these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse
effect on its business. Regardless of the outcome
 litigation can
have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and
settlement costs
 diversion of management resources
 and other
factors.




Guarantee Deposits



has deposits in Korea for collateral on IPC returns dictated by
law
 and collateral to credit card companies for guarantee of IPC
payments. As of December&#xA0;31
 2018
 approximately $0.8 million
of guarantee deposits are included in other long-term assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet.




NOTE 12 &#x2014; RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

CONCENTRATIONS




Fair Value Measurements



value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants on the measurement date. When
determining fair value
 the Company considers the principal or most
advantageous market in which it transacts and considers assumptions
that market participants would use when pricing the asset or
liability. The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy
which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three
levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the
lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair
measurement:













NEW AGE BEVERAGES CORPORATION &#xA0;



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






1&#x2014;Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement
date



2&#x2014;Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are
observable for the asset and liability
 either directly or
indirectly through market collaboration
 for substantially the full
term of the asset or liability



3&#x2014;Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to
measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not
available
 thereby allowing for situations in which there is
little
 if any market activity for the asset or liability at
measurement date




fair value of the Company&#x2019;s cash and cash equivalents
restricted cash
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable and accrued
liabilities
 payables to former Morinda shareholders
 and notes
payable approximate their carrying values as of December&#xA0;31

consideration obligations incurred in the business combinations
with Marley and Morinda are recorded at estimated fair value as of
December&#xA0;31
 2018 and 2017. In addition

acquired in the business combinations discussed in Note 3 were
generally recorded at fair market value on the date of closing. The
Company did not have any other nonrecurring assets and liabilities
measured at fair value as of December&#xA0;31
 2018 and
2017.




Company&#x2019;s interest rate swap and embedded derivative
liability are the only liabilities that have been carried at fair
value on a recurring basis. The Company&#x2019;s interest rate swap
is recorded at fair market value and has been classified within
Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company&#x2019;s embedded
derivative liability is recorded at fair market value and has been
classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Details of
the interest rate swap and the embedded derivative liabilities
including valuation methodology and key assumptions and estimates
used
 are disclosed in Note 7. The Company&#x2019;s policy is to
recognize asset or liability transfers among Level 1
 Level 2 and
Level 3 as of the actual date of the events or change in
circumstances that caused the transfer. During the years ended
December&#xA0;31
 2018 and 2017
 the Company had no transfers of
its assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value
hierarchy.




Significant Concentrations



For the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 one customer
comprised approximately 11% and 10%
 respectively
 of the

portion of the business acquired from Morinda is conducted in
foreign markets
 exposing the Company to the risks of trade or
foreign exchange restrictions
 increased tariffs
 foreign currency
fluctuations and similar risks associated with foreign operations.
Approximately 70% of the Company&#x2019;s consolidated net revenue
and 90% of Morinda&#x2019;s net revenue for 2019 is expected to be
generated outside the United States
 primarily in the Asia Pacific
 Juice
 MAX and
other noni-based beverage products are expected to comprise over
85% of Morinda&#x2019;s net revenue for 2019. However
 if consumer
demand for these products decreases significantly or if the Company
ceases to offer these products without a suitable replacement
 the
Company&#x2019;s consolidated financial condition and operating
results would be adversely affected. The Company purchases fruit
and other Noni-based raw materials from French Polynesia
 but these
purchases of materials are from a wide variety of individual
suppliers with no single supplier accounting for more than 10% of
its raw material purchases during 2018. However
 as the majority of
the raw materials are consolidated and processed at the
Company&#x2019;s plant in Tahiti
 the Company could be negatively
affected by certain governmental actions or natural disasters if
they occurred in that region of the world.




instruments that subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk consist primarily of cash
 cash equivalents
 restricted cash
and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash
 cash
equivalents and restricted cash at high-quality financial
institutions. Cash deposits
 including those held in foreign
branches of global banks often exceed the amount of insurance
 if
any
 provided on such deposits. As of December 31
 2018
 the
Company had cash and cash equivalents with a single financial
institution in the United States with a balance of $6.5 million
and two financial institutions in China with balances of $14.5
million and $8.0 million. The Company also had $3.2 million of
restricted cash in China as of December 31
 2018. The Company has
never experienced any losses related to its investments in cash
cash equivalents and restricted cash.




credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is diversified due
to the number of entities comprising the Company&#x2019;s customer
base and their dispersion across different geographies and
industries. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations on
certain customers and generally does not require collateral on
accounts receivable. The Company maintains reserves for potential
bad debts and historically such losses have been insignificant.

 2017
 one customer
comprised approximately 11% of accounts receivable
net.&#xA0;

NOTE 15 &#x2014; SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATIONS




Reportable Segments



Company follows segment reporting in accordance with ASC Topic 280
. As a
result of the business combination with Morinda in December 2018 as
discussed in Note 3
 the Company has changed its operating segments
to consist of the Morinda segment and the New Age segment. The New
Age segment was previously comprised of the Brands segment and the
DSD segment which are now combined as a single segment as they are
operating with a single management team. After the Morinda business
combination
 the Company&#x2019;s CODM began assessing performance
and allocating resources based on the financial information of
these two reporting segments. Accordingly
 the Company&#x2019;s
previous segment disclosures have been restated for the year ended
December 31
 2017.

Colorado and surrounding states
 and sells beverages to wholesale
distributors

 the Company entered into a Loan and Security
Agreement (the &#x201C;Loan Agreement&#x201D;) with East West Bank
(&#x201C;EWB&#x201D;).&#xA0; The Loan Agreement matures on March 29
2023 and provides for (i) a term loan in the aggregate principal
amount of $15.0 million
 which may be increase to $25.0 subject to
the satisfaction of certain conditions (the &#x201C;Term

 EWB funded
$25.0 million to the Company consisting of the $15.0 million Term
Loan and $10.0 as an advance under the Revolving Loan
The obligations of the
Company under the Loan Agreement are secured by substantially all
assets of the Company and guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the
 The Loan
Agreement requires compliance with certain financial and

customary events of default. Key financial covenants include
maintenance of minimum Adjusted EBITDA and a maximum Total Leverage
Ratio (all as defined and set forth in the Loan Agreement). During
any periods when an event of default occurs
 the Loan Agreement
provides for interest at a rate that is 3.0% above the rate
otherwise applicable to such obligations.















Borrowings outstanding under the Loan Agreement bear interest at
the Prime Rate plus 0.25%. However
 if the Total Leverage Ratio (as
defined in the Loan Agreement) is equal to or greater than 1.50 to
1.00
 borrowings will bear interest at the Prime Rate plus 0.50%.
The Company may voluntarily prepay amounts outstanding under the
Revolving Loan Facility on ten business days&#x2019; prior notice to
EWB without prepayment charges. In the event the Revolving Loan
Facility is terminated prior to its maturity
 the Company would be
required to pay an early termination fee in the amount of 0.50% of
the revolving line. Additional borrowing requests under the
Revolving Loan Facility are subject to various customary conditions

unused line fee equal to 0.5% per annum of the undrawn portion. The
Loan Agreement includes a lockbox arrangement where the Company is
required to direct its customers to remit payments to a restricted
bank account
 whereby all available funds are used to pay down the
outstanding principal balance under the Revolving Loan
Facility.



Payments under the Term Loan are interest-only for the first six
months and are followed by principal and interest payments
amortized over the remaining term of the Term Loan. The Company may
elect to prepay the Term Loan before its maturity on 10 business
days&#x2019; notice to EWB subject to a prepayment fee of 2% for the
first year of the Term Loan and 1% for the second year of the Term

fiscal year
 commencing with the fiscal year ending December 31
2019
 the Company is required to make a payment towards the
outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan in an amount equal to
35% of the Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Loan Agreement)



than or equal to 1.50 to 1.00


&#xA0;


Also on March 29
 2019
 the Company repaid all outstanding amounts
and terminated the Siena Revolver discussed in Note 7
 whereby a
prepayment fee of $0.5 million was incurred.



Sale Leaseback



On March 22
 2019
 the Company entered into an agreement with a
major Japanese real estate company resulting in the sale for
approximately $55 million of the land and building in Tokyo that
serves as the corporate headquarters of Morinda&#x2019;s Japanese
subsidiary. Concurrently with the sale
 the Company entered into a
lease of this property for an initial noncancelable term of seven
years
 with an option at the Company&#x2019;s discretion to extend
the lease term for 20 additional years. The monthly lease cost is
&#xA5;20 million (approximately $181
000 as of March 22
 2019) for
the initial seven-year term.



In connection with this transaction
 the Company repaid the $2.9
million mortgage on the building discussed in Note 7
 cancelled the
related interest rate swap agreement discussed in Note 7
 and is
obligated to pay $25.0 million to the former stockholders of
Morinda to eliminate the contingent financing liability discussed
in Note 3. After these payments
 income taxes
 post-closing repair
obligations
 and transaction costs
 the net proceeds from the sale
leaseback are expected to be between $9.0 million and $12.0
million.



The net carrying value of this property was approximately $29.0
million
 resulting in a gain of approximately $26.0 million. The
Company is evaluating whether this transaction qualifies as a sale
).
Depending on the final results of this evaluation
 the gain on sale
will either be (i) amortized as a reduction of future lease expense
over the initial noncancelable term
 or (ii) recognized in the
Company&#x2019;s consolidated statement of operations for the
quarter ended March 31
 2019. The Company has not yet determined
the amount of ROU lease asset and the corresponding ROU lease
liability that will be recognized during the first quarter of
2019.



Other Transactions




January 14
 2019
 the Company entered into an agreement with
Docklight LLC for the exclusive licensing rights in the United
States for the manufacturing

 the trademarks MARLEY and
BOB MARLEY for use in connection with the Company&#x2019;s existing
licensed marks. The initial term of the Agreement expires in
January 2024

which fee shall be reviewed annually by the
parties.



January 21
 2019

average approximately $33
000 per month over the lease term which
expires in December 2029. The Company has options to terminate the
lease after 90 months as well as the option to extend the lease for
an additional period of five years.





March 12
 2019
 the Company granted restricted stock awards to
members of the Board of Directors for an aggregate of 90
910 shares
The fair
value of these shares was $0.5 million based on the closing price
of the Company&#x2019;s Common Stock on the grant date. Compensation
expense will be recognized until the restricted stock awards vest
on March 12
 2020.



the first quarter of 2019
 the Company entered into operating lease
obligations for transportation equipment. These leases provide for
fixed minimum payments of approximately $17
000 per month over the
eight-year lease term for an aggregate commitment of $1.7 million.
The present value of these obligations of $1.3 million will be
recorded as an ROU lease asset and ROU lease liability for the
first quarter of 2019.

















Item&#xA0;9.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Changes in and Disagreements with
Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.








Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.




Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures




maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by is
in the reports we file or submit under the Act is recorded
processed
 summarized
 and reported within the time periods
specified in the Commission&#x2019;s rules and forms
 and to ensure
that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer
 or persons performing similar functions
 as
appropriate
 to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.




management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer
 does not expect that our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) (&#x201C;Disclosure Controls&#x201D;) will prevent all
errors and all fraud. A control system
 no matter how well
conceived and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Further
 the design of a control system must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints
 and the benefits of controls must
be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud
 if any
 within the Company have been detected. These
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision-making can be faulty
 and that breakdowns can occur
because of simple error or mistake. Additionally
 controls can be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons
 by collusion
of two or more people
 or by management override of the control.
The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon
certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
 and
there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving
its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of
the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
We monitor our Disclosure Controls and make modifications as
necessary; our intent in this regard is that the Disclosure
Controls will be modified as systems change and conditions
warrant.




evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
Disclosure Controls was performed as of the end of the period
covered by this Report. This evaluation was performed under the
supervision and with the participation of our management
 including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on
this evaluation
 we concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective.




Management&#x2019;s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting




management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). In order to evaluate
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
 as
required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 our
management
 with the participation of our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer has conducted an
assessment
 including testing
 using the criteria in Internal
Control &#x2013; Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
&#x201D;)
(2013). Our system of internal control over financial reporting is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. This assessment included review of the documentation
of controls
 evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls
testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion
on this evaluation.




on this evaluation
 management concluded that our internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of December 31
2018.&#xA0;




currently reviewing our disclosure controls and procedures related
to all risk areas and expect to continually improve in the next
calendar year
 including identifying specific areas within our
governance
 accounting and financial reporting processes to add
adequate resources to mitigate any potential
weaknesses.




management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness
of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls
over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to
taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or
improvements
 as necessary and as funds allow.



















of its inherent limitations
 internal controls over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems
 no matter
how well designed
 have inherent limitations. Therefore
 even those
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation.




Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting


&#xA0;


were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during the fiscal quarter ended December 31
 2018
 that has
materially affected
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect
our internal control over financial reporting.

PREMISES






Leased Premises






Tenant and Tenant rents from Landlord the premises shown in
 (the
&#x201C;Premises&#x201D;) containing the floor area set forth in Item
8 of the Basic Lease Provisions and known by the suite numbers
identified in Item 2 of the Basic Lease Provisions. The Premises
are located in the Building identified in Item 2 of the Basic Lease
Provisions (which together with the underlying real property is
referred to herein as the &#x201C;Building&#x201D;). The rentable
square footage of the Premises set forth in Item 8 of the Basic
Lease Provisions is deemed conclusive as between the
parties.





Acceptances of
Premises






acknowledges that neither Landlord nor any representative of
Landlord has made any representation or warranty with respect to
the Premises or the Building or the suitability or fitness of
either for any purpose except as set forth in this Lease. The
taking of possession or use of the Premises by Tenant conclusively
establishes that the Premises and the Building were in satisfactory
condition and in conformity with the provisions of this Lease in
all respects
 except for those matters which Tenant shall have
brought to Landlord&#x2019;s attention on a written punch list
delivered to Landlord. The list shall be limited to any items
required to be accomplished by Landlord under the Work Letter and
shall be delivered to Landlord within five (5) days after the Lease
Term commences as provided in Article III below. Landlord shall
diligently complete all punch list items of which it is notified as
provided above for which it is liable. Nothing contained in this
Section shall affect the commencement of the Lease Term or the
obligation of Tenant to pay Rent. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein
 Tenant accepts the Premises in its &#x201C;As
Is&#x201D; existing condition and waives any right or claim against
Landlord arising out of the condition of the Premises.










Building Name and Address






shall not utilize any name selected by Landlord from time to time
for the Building and/or the Premises as any part of Tenant&#x2019;s
corporate or trade name. Landlord shall have the right to change
the name
 number or designation of the Building or Premises without
liability to Tenant.







TERM






General






term of this Lease (&#x201C;Lease Term&#x201D;) shall be for the
period shown in Item 5 of the Basic Lease Provisions. The Lease
Term shall commence on the Commencement Date specified in Item 4 of
the Basic Lease Provisions. Within ten (10) days after possession
of the Premises is tendered to Tenant
 the parties shall
memorialize on a form provided by Landlord the actual Commencement
Date and the expiration date (the &#x201C;Expiration Date&#x201D;) of
this Lease. Tenant&#x2019;s failure to execute that form shall not
affect the validity of Landlord&#x2019;s determination of those
dates.






Delay in Possession






Landlord
 for any reason not within its reasonable control
 is
delayed in delivering possession of the Premises to Tenant beyond
the Estimated Commencement Date
 this Lease shall not be void or
voidable nor shall Landlord be liable to Tenant for any resulting
loss or damage; provided
 however
 that Tenant shall not be liable
for any Monthly Rental (defined below) hereunder
 and the
Commencement Date shall not be deemed to have occurred
 until
Landlord delivers possession of the Premises with the TI Work
substantially completed. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 if
Landlord&#x2019;s failure to so deliver possession of the Premises
to Tenant on or before the Estimated Commencement Date specified in
Item 4 of the Basic Lease Provisions is attributable to any Tenant
Delay (defined below)
 then the Commencement Date shall not be
advanced to the date on which possession of the Premises is
tendered to Tenant
 and Landlord shall be entitled to full
performance by Tenant (including the payment of Monthly Rental)
from the date Landlord would have been able to deliver the Premises
to Tenant but for the Tenant Delay(s). As used herein
 the term
&#x201C;Tenant Delay&#x201D; shall mean one (1) or more actual delays
in the performance of the TI Work which are caused by (a)
Tenant&#x2019;s request for changes in the Plans and Specifications
(b) Tenant&#x2019;s request for materials
 finishes or installations
which are other than Building standard materials or (c) any other
act or omission of Tenant; provided
 however
 that no delay shall
be deemed a Tenant Delay unless Landlord notifies Tenant promptly
of any such act or failure to act.



















Tenant&#x2019;s Option to Extend Term






not in default under the Lease
 either at the time Tenant makes
such election or at the time the Extension Period (as defined
below) would otherwise commence
 and Tenant has not received three
(3) or more notices of events of default during the previous five
years
 Tenant shall have the number of options to extend the Lease
Term set forth in Item 5 of the Basic Lease Provisions
 such option
being for an additional period of five (5) years (the
&#x201C;Extension Period&#x201D;). Such option shall be exercised
 if
at all
 by Tenant giving written notice of exercise thereof (the
&#x201C;Option Notice&#x201D;) to Landlord not fewer than nine (9)
months nor more than twelve (12) months in advance of the
expiration of the then-current Lease Term of this Lease. In the
event Tenant exercises the option to extend this Lease
 the Lease
shall continue for the Extension Period on all of the terms and
conditions as herein set forth
 provided that Base Rent for the
Extension Period shall be as set forth in Section 3.4; and the
Lease Term shall be deemed to include such Extension Period; and
Landlord will not be obligated to improve the Premises or to
contribute to their improvement. If Tenant does not exercise the
extension option as provided herein
 then all remaining unexercised
term extension rights hereunder shall become null and void. The
extension option shall be personal to the original Tenant named
herein
 or a transferee which succeeds to such original
Tenant&#x2019;s interest herein pursuant to an Exempt Transfer as
described in Section 9.1(c) hereof
 but shall become null and void
upon any other assignment or sublease of this Lease by
Tenant.






Fair Market Rental Value






commencement of the Extension Period
 the Lease shall be adjusted
to reflect a new Base Rent for the Premises equal to 100% of the
average base rents per rentable square foot charged for comparable
non-renewal
 non-equity tenants of comparable size
 considering the
age of the building
 quality
 floor height
 location in the South
Platte River buildings in the Denver market
 and other reasonable
factors relevant to a fair market rent determination
 for a
comparable term under leases entered into within six months prior
to the date Tenant exercises the applicable option
 and further
taking into account the relative creditworthiness of the Tenant and
the presence or absence of brokerage commissions
 tenant
improvement allowance(s)
 landlord initial improvement work at
landlord&#x2019;s expense
 base years
 construction time
 and all
other lease concessions (the &#x201C;Fair Market Rental
Rate&#x201D;)
 as reasonably calculated by Landlord in good faith;
provided
 however
 that in no event shall the Base Rent for any
Extension Period be less than the Base Rent payable immediately
prior to the commencement of the Extension Period. Landlord shall
advise Tenant of such rental adjustment within one month after
Landlord&#x2019;s receipt of Tenant&#x2019;s Option Notice. Tenant
shall have twenty (20) days following Tenant&#x2019;s receipt of
notice of the rental adjustment (the &#x201C;Rent Adjustment
Notice&#x201D;) within which to accept such terms by executing any
appropriate reasonable documentation submitted by Landlord to
Tenant. If Tenant disagrees with Landlord&#x2019;s calculation of
the Fair Market Rental Rate and if Landlord and Tenant have not
reached a written agreement on Fair Market Rental Rate for the
applicable Extension Period within thirty (30) days after the date
Landlord gives Tenant the Rent Adjustment Notice (the
&#x201C;Adjustment Notice Date&#x201D;)
 each party shall appoint a
qualified real estate broker with at least seven years of
experience in office leasing in the South Platte River Denver
marketplace (a &#x201C;Qualified Broker&#x201D;) for the purpose of
determining Fair Market Rental Rate for the applicable Extension
Period and shall give written notice of such appointment to the
other party within forty (40) days after the Adjustment Notice
Date. The written agreement of the Qualified Brokers appointed as
provided above regarding the Fair Market Rental Rate shall be a
conclusive determination of the Fair Market Rental Rate for
purposes of determining the Base Rent payable by Tenant during the
applicable Extension Period. If such Qualified Brokers have not
reached a written agreement on the Fair Market Rental Rate within
sixty (60) days after the Adjustment Notice Date
 the two Qualified
Brokers shall select a third Qualified Broker and give written
notice of such appointment to Landlord and Tenant within seventy
(70) days after the Adjustment Notice Date. The three Qualified
Brokers so appointed shall fix a date for completion of their
determination of the Fair Market Rental Rate
 such date to be not
later than ninety (90) days after the Adjustment Notice Date. On or
before such date
 the three Qualified Brokers shall meet and shall
submit their determinations in writing to Landlord and Tenant. The
Fair Market Rental Rate used to determine the new Base Rent for the
Extension Period for the Premises
 as applicable
 shall be an
amount equal to the numerical average of the two figures closest to
each other in absolute value. (For purposes of example only
 if the
determinations were $4.50/sf
 $5.00/sf and $5.55/sf
 the governing
Fair Market Rental Rate would be $4.75/sf
 the average of the two
lower figures
 since the $.50 difference between them is less than
the $.55 difference between the higher two figures.) If for any
reason any of the Qualified Brokers fails timely to submit its
determination of the Fair Market Rental Rate to Landlord and
Tenant
 then the numerical average of such determinations as were
timely submitted shall be the governing Fair Market Rental Rate.
Landlord and Tenant shall each be responsible for payment of the
fees of the Qualified Broker it selects; the fee for the third
Qualified Broker
 if any
 shall be divided evenly between Landlord
and Tenant
 such that each party shall pay one-half thereof. In no
event shall the terms offered by Landlord under this Section 3.4
bind Landlord to offer such terms to Tenant or to any other person
or entity at any time except as explicitly set forth herein
 nor
shall such terms prevent Landlord from leasing the Premises to any
person or entity on different terms if Tenant does not timely
accept the terms determined in accordance with this Section
3.4.






Termination Option






as no default defined in Section&#xA0;`14.1 has occurred before the
Notice Date defined in this Section and neither a default exists
nor circumstances exists that would be a default after the giving
of notice or the passage of time
 or both
 on the Termination Date
defined in this Section
 Tenant will have the right to terminate
 full calendar month
of the Lease Term (the &#x201C;Termination Date&#x201D;) by written
notice to Landlord given at least nine full months before the
Termination Date (the &#x201C;Notice Date&#x201D;). Tenant&#x2019;s
notice will be accompanied by its payment of: (a) (i) the
unamortized costs incurred by Landlord to improve the Premises
pursuant to the TI Work; (ii) the unamortized amounts of abated
Base Rent; (iii) the unamortized amount paid by Landlord pursuant
;
and (iv) interest on the foregoing unamortized amounts at the rate
of 8% per annum. The amortizations will be over the Lease Term
plus (b) the Base Rent due for the six months following the
Termination Date. Landlord and Tenant will perform all of their
obligations in this Lease up to and including the Termination Date.
On the Termination Date
 the rights and obligations of Landlord and
Tenant that have not accrued or do not survive this Lease by its
terms or by law will cease. The termination option shall be
personal to the original Tenant named herein
 or a transferee which
succeeds to such original Tenant&#x2019;s interest herein pursuant
to an Exempt Transfer as described in Section 9.1(c) hereof
 and
shall become null and void upon any other assignment or sublease of
this Lease by Tenant.




















RENT AND OPERATING EXPENSES

 from and after the
Commencement Date
 Tenant shall pay to Landlord without deduction

be applied against the Base Rent first due and payable hereunder.
As used in this Lease
 the term &#x201C;Monthly Rental&#x201D; shall
mean the amount payable by Tenant in respect of any month during
the term for Base Rent and Tenant&#x2019;s Percentage Share of
Operating Expenses (defined below); and the term &#x201C;Additional
Rent&#x201D; shall mean all amounts of any type whatsoever other

Operating Expenses




For each Expense
Recovery Period
 Tenant shall pay
 as Additional Rent
Tenant&#x2019;s Percentage Share (as set forth in the Basic Lease
Provisions) of Operating Expenses (defined below). Tenant
acknowledges Landlord&#x2019;s rights to make changes or additions
to the Building from time to time pursuant to Section 6.5 below
 in
which event the total rentable square footage within the Building
shall be adjusted.


Commencing prior to
the start of the first full Expense Recovery Period of the Lease
(as set forth in Item 7 of the Basic Lease Provisions)
 and prior
to the start of each full or partial Expense Recovery Period
thereafter
 Landlord shall give Tenant a written estimate of the
amount of Tenant&#x2019;s Percentage Share of Operating Expenses for
the Expense Recovery Period or portion thereof. Tenant shall pay
the estimated amount to Landlord in equal monthly installments in
advance with Base Rent. If Landlord has not furnished its written
estimate for any Expense Recovery Period by the time set forth
above
 Tenant shall continue to pay cost reimbursements at the
rates established for the prior Expense Recovery Period
 if any;
provided that when the new estimate is delivered to Tenant
 Tenant
shall
 at the next monthly payment date
 pay any accrued cost
reimbursements based upon the new estimate.


Within one hundred
twenty (120) days after the end of each Expense Recovery Period
Landlord shall endeavor to furnish to Tenant a statement showing in
reasonable detail the actual or prorated Operating Expenses
incurred by Landlord during the period and the parties shall
within thirty (30) days thereafter
 make any payment or allowance
necessary to adjust Tenant&#x2019;s estimated payments
 if any
 to
Tenant&#x2019;s Percentage Share of actual Operating Expenses for
such Expense Recovery Period as shown by the annual statement. Any
amount due Tenant shall be credited against installments next
coming due under this Section 4.2
 and any deficiency shall be paid
by Tenant together with the next installment. If Tenant has not
made estimated payments during the Expense Recovery Period
 any
amount owing by Tenant pursuant to subsection (a) above shall be
paid to Landlord in accordance with Article XVI. Should Tenant fail
to object in writing to Landlord&#x2019;s determination of actual
Operating Expenses within sixty (60) days following delivery of
Landlord&#x2019;s expense statement
 Landlord&#x2019;s determination
of actual Operating Expenses for the applicable Expense Recovery
Period shall be conclusive and binding on the parties.


Even though the
Lease has terminated and the Tenant has vacated the Premises when
the final determination is made of Tenant&#x2019;s share of
Operating Expenses for the Expense Recovery Period in which the
Lease terminates
 Tenant shall
 upon notice
 pay the entire
increase due over the estimated expenses paid. Conversely
 any
overpayment made in the event expenses decrease shall be rebated by
Landlord to Tenant.


If
 at any time
during any Expense Recovery Period
 any one or more of the
Operating Expenses are increased to a rate(s) or amount(s) in
excess of the rate(s) or amount(s) used in calculating the
estimated expenses for the year
 then Tenant&#x2019;s estimated
share of Operating Expenses shall be increased for the month in
which the increase becomes effective and for all succeeding months
by an amount equal to Tenant&#x2019;s proportionate share of the
increase. Landlord shall give Tenant written notice of the amount
or estimated amount of the increase
 the month in which the
increase will become effective
 Tenant&#x2019;s monthly share
thereof
 and the months for which the payments are due. Tenant
shall pay the increase to Landlord as a part of Tenant&#x2019;s
monthly payments of estimated expenses
 as provided in paragraph
(b) above
 commencing with the month in which it is
effective.















The term Operating
Expenses shall include all expenses of operation and maintenance of
the Building
 together with all appurtenant Common Facilities (as
defined in Section 6.2)

 6.4
 below; and a
reasonable overhead/management fee. It is understood that Operating
Expenses shall include competitive charges for direct services
provided by any subsidiary or division of Landlord. The term
&#x201C;taxes
&#x201D; as used herein shall include the following:
(i) all real estate taxes or personal property taxes

deregulation
 the Operating Expenses in Tenant&#x2019;s Operating
Expense Base Year shall be adjusted to reflect the reduced utility
expenses. A copy of Landlord&#x2019;s unaudited statement of
expenses shall be made available to Tenant upon request. The
Operating Expenses may be extrapolated by Landlord to reflect at
least ninety-five percent (95%) occupancy of the rentable area of
the Building during any Expense Recovery Period.


Landlord shall have
the right
 from time to time
 to allocate some or all of the
Operating Expenses for the Building among different portions

as office or retail portions
&#x201D;)
 in accordance with
generally accepted accounting and management practices. The
Operating Expenses within each Cost Pool shall be allocated and
charged to tenants within such Cost Pool as an amount per square
foot of rentable area
 based upon the total rentable area within
such Cost Pool. The Operating Expenses for the Building (or only
those Operating Expenses allocable to the Cost Pool of the Building
which includes the tenants of such space
 if such an allocation is
made) shall be allocated and charged to tenants based on the
rentable area of the Building (or based on the rentable area of
such Cost Pool if such an allocation of Operating Expenses is
made).


Without limiting
the generality of the terms and provisions of subparagraph (c)
above
 Tenant shall have the right to review or audit
 at
Tenant&#x2019;s sole cost
 any of Landlord&#x2019;s books and records
pertaining to Operating Expenses or Landlord&#x2019;s calculations
of Tenant&#x2019;s Percentage Share thereof
 on thirty (30)
days&#x2019; advance written notice thereof to Landlord
 which
notice shall be delivered
 if at all
 within one (1) year of
Landlord&#x2019;s delivery of the annual expense reconciliation
statement to Tenant. In no event shall Tenant perform more than one
audit during any calendar year. Such review or audit shall take
place where such records are kept (provided such location is in the
general geographic region of the Building)
 and shall be conducted
by a reputable firm which regularly provides such services or any
reputable accounting firm chosen by Tenant. Tenant shall use all
reasonable efforts to minimize interference with Landlord&#x2019;s
business during any such audit and Tenant shall provide a copy of
such audit to Landlord within thirty (30) days of receipt of same
by Tenant. If such examination shall establish any overcharge by
Landlord
 the amount of such overcharge shall be automatically
credited against Tenant&#x2019;s Operating Expenses contributions
next coming due hereunder
 or upon the expiration or termination of
this Lease pay to Tenant the unapplied balance of any such
credit.






Security Deposit






Tenant&#x2019;s delivery of this Lease
 Tenant shall deliver to
Landlord the Security Deposit
 as stated in Item 9 of the Basic
Lease Provisions
 to be held by Landlord as security for the full
and faithful performance of Tenant&#x2019;s obligations under this
Lease. Upon any default or breach by Tenant under the Lease
including specifically Tenant&#x2019;s failure to pay Base Rent or
Additional Rent or to abide by its obligations under Sections 7.1
and 15.3 below
 Landlord may
 without prejudice to any other remedy
it has
 draw on that portion of the Security Deposit (i) as full or
partial compensation for that default
 (ii) for any expense
 loss
damage or liability that Landlord suffers because of Tenant&#x2019;s
default or breach
 or (iii) pay any arrearage or otherwise any Base
Rent or Additional Rent in default or breach. If any portion of the
Security Deposit is so applied
 Tenant shall
 within five (5) days
after such application by Landlord
 restore the Security Deposit to
its original amount. Landlord shall not be required to keep the
proceeds of the Security Deposit separate from its general funds
and Tenant shall not be entitled to interest on the Security
Deposit
 if any. In the event of bankruptcy or other debtor relief
proceedings by or against Tenant
 the Security Deposit shall be
deemed to be applied first to the payment of rent and other charges
due Landlord
 in the order that such rent or charges become due and
owing
 for all periods prior to filing of such proceedings. So long
as no default by Tenant has occurred before the end of the
 full
month of the Lease Term and no circumstance then exists that would
be a default by Tenant after giving of notice or the passage of
time
 or both
 Landlord will return to Tenant before the end of the
 full
month of the Lease Term the amount by when the Security Deposit
exceeds the Base Rent due for the last full month of the Lease
Term. If Tenant fully performs its obligations under this Lease
the Security Deposit or any balance thereof shall be returned to
Tenant (or at Landlord&#x2019;s option to the last assignee of
Tenant&#x2019;s interest in this Lease) after the expiration of the
Lease Term
 provided that Landlord may retain the Security Deposit
until such time as all amounts due from Tenant in accordance with
this Lease have been determined and paid in full.





















REIT

of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended (the
&#x201C;Code&#x201D;) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder (the &#x201C;Regulations&#x201D;).
In the event that (i) the Code or the Regulations
 or
interpretations thereof by the Internal Revenue Service contained

 shall be
changed so that any Rent no longer so qualifies as &#x201C;rent from
real property&#x201D; for purposes of either said Section 512(b)(3
or Section 856(d) or (ii) Landlord
 in its sole discretion
determines that there is any risk that all or part of any Rent
shall not qualify as &#x201C;rents from real property&#x201D; for the
purposes of either said Sections 512(d)(3) or 856(d)
 Tenant agrees
to cooperate with Landlord and enter into such amendment or
amendments to this Lease as Landlord deems necessary to qualify all
Rents as &#x201C;rents from real property
&#x201D; provided
 however
that (A) any amendment required under this Section shall be made so
as to produce
 to the extent possible
 the equivalent (in economic
terms) Rent as payable before the amendment
 and (B) in the event
that Landlord determines that an amendment cannot produce
economically equivalent Rent as described in clause (A)
 the Rent
payable under any such amendment shall not be any less favorable to
Tenant than the Rent payable under this Lease immediately prior to
such amendment. The parties agree to execute such further
commercially reasonable instrument as may reasonably be required by
Landlord in order to give effect to the foregoing provisions of
this Section. Additionally
 no Rent payable under this Lease may be
attributable to personal property unless (i) such personal property

be released of record by payment or posting of a proper bond
Landlord shall have
 in addition to all other available remedies

the right to use any and all means which Landlord may deem proper
to open the doors in an emergency in order to obtain entry to the

Building; (iii) Hazardous Material present on or under the Building
as a result of any discharge
 dumping or spilling (whether
accidental or otherwise) on the Building by other tenants of the
Building or their agents
 employees
 contractors or invitees
 or by
others; and (iv) material which becomes Hazardous Material due to a
change in laws
 codes
 regulations or ordinances which relate to
hazardous or toxic material
 substances or waste. Tenant agrees
that the costs incurred by Landlord with respect to
 or in
connection with
 complying with laws
 codes
 regulations or
ordinances relating to Hazardous Material shall be an Operating
Expense
 unless the cost of such compliance
 as between Landlord
and Tenant
 is made the responsibility of Tenant under this Lease.
To the extent Tenant contributes to any such Operating Expense
relating to Hazardous Material
 and such Operating Expense is
subsequently recovered or reimbursed through insurance
 or
recovered from responsible third parties
 or other action
 Tenant
shall be entitled to a proportionate share of such Operating
Expense to which such recovery or reimbursement
relates.


Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Lease
 Tenant shall not
transport
 use
 store
 maintain
 generate
 manufacture
 handle
dispose
 release
 or discharge any Hazardous Material upon or about
the Premises or the Building
 nor permit Tenant&#x2019;s employee
agents
 contractors
 and other occupants of the Premises to engage
in such activities upon or about the Building. However
 the
foregoing provisions shall not prohibit the transportation to and
from
 and use
 storage
 maintenance
 and handling within
 the
Premises of ordinary cleaning products and office supplies (such as
correction fluid
 copy machine toner
 etc.) that are not regulated
by governmental authorities and are used in the ordinary course of
Tenant&#x2019;s permitted business
 provided all of the following
conditions are met: (i) such substances are used and maintained
only in such quantities as are reasonably necessary for such
permitted use of the Premises
 strictly in accordance with
applicable laws and the manufacturers&#x2019; instructions therefor;
(ii) such substances are not disposed of
 released
 or discharged
on the Building and are transported to and from the Premises in
compliance with all laws
 and as Landlord shall reasonably require;
(iii) if any applicable law or if Landlord&#x2019;s trash removal
contractor requires that any such substances be disposed of
separately from ordinary trash
 Tenant shall make arrangements at
Tenant&#x2019;s sole cost and expense for such disposal directly
with a qualified and licensed disposal company at a lawful disposal
site
 and shall ensure that disposal occurs frequently enough to
prevent unnecessary storage of such substances in the Premises; and
(iv) any remaining such substances shall be completely
 properly
and lawfully removed from the Building upon expiration or earlier
termination of this Lease.















Tenant shall
promptly notify Landlord of: (i) any enforcement
 cleanup or other
regulatory action taken or threatened by any governmental or
regulatory authority with respect to the presence of any Hazardous
Material on the Premises or the migration thereof from or to other
property
 (ii) any demands or claims made or threatened by any
party against Tenant or the Premises relating to any loss or injury
resulting from any Hazardous Material on or from the Premises
 and
(iii) any matters where Tenant is required by law to give a notice
to any governmental or regulatory authority respecting any
Hazardous Material on the Premises. Landlord shall have the right
(but not the obligation) to join and participate
 as a party
 in
any legal proceedings or actions affecting the Premises initiated
in connection with any environmental
 health
 or safety law. If any
Hazardous Material is released
 discharged or disposed of by Tenant
or any other occupant of the Premises
 or their employees
 agents
or contractors
 on or about the Building in violation of this
Lease
 in addition to notifying Landlord
 Tenant shall immediately
properly and in compliance with applicable laws clean up and remove
the Hazardous Material from the Building and any other affected
area
 at Tenant&#x2019;s sole cost and expense. Such clean up and
removal shall be subject to Landlord&#x2019;s prior written approval
(except in emergencies)
 and shall include any and all testing
investigation
 and preparation and the implementation of any
remedial action plan required by any governmental body having
jurisdiction or as reasonably by Landlord. If Tenant shall fail to
comply with the provisions of this Section within five (5) days
after written notice by Landlord
 or such shorter time as may be
required by law or in order to minimize any hazard to persons or
property
 Landlord may
 but shall not be obligated to
 arrange for
such compliance directly or as Tenant&#x2019;s agent through
contractors or other parties selected by Landlord
 at
Tenant&#x2019;s sole cost and expense (without limiting
Landlord&#x2019;s other remedies under this Lease or applicable
laws.


At such times as
Landlord may request in its sole and absolute discretion
 Tenant
shall provide Landlord with a written list identifying any
Hazardous Material then used
 stored
 or maintained upon the
Premises
 the use and approximate quantity of each such material
 a
copy of any material safety data sheet (&#x201C;MSDS&#x201D;) issued
by the manufacturer thereof
 written information concerning the
removal
 transportation
 and disposal of the same
 and such other
information as Landlord may require or may be required by law.
Tenant agrees that it shall promptly complete and deliver to
Landlord any disclosure form regarding Hazardous Materials that may
be required by any governmental agency. Tenant shall promptly
 upon
demand
 reimburse Landlord for any additional insurance premium
charged by reason of Tenant&#x2019;s failure to comply with the
provisions of this Section 7.6.


If any Hazardous
Material is released
 discharged
 or disposed of on or about the
Building and such release
 discharge
 or disposal is not caused by
Tenant or other occupants of the Premises
 or their employees
agents or contractors
 such release
 discharge
 or disposal shall
be deemed casualty damage under Article 11 to the extent that the
Premises or the Common Facilities serving the Premises are affected
thereby; in such case
 Landlord and Tenant shall have the
obligations and rights respecting such casualty damage provided
under Article 11 of this Lease.


Tenant shall not
install any freon-containing systems or equipment including
 but
not limited to
 refrigerators
 freezers
 supplemental HVAC systems
or self-contained air conditioners without Landlord&#x2019;s prior
written approval. If a freon-containing system is so approved by
Landlord
 Tenant shall remove said system prior to the Expiration
Date of the Lease
 at Tenant&#x2019;s sole cost and expense. Tenant
shall comply with all legal requirements
 industry practices and
rules established by Landlord in performing such removal work
 and
Tenant shall restore the Premises to the condition
 which existed
immediately prior to the installation of the freon
system.




















TAXES AND ASSESSMENTS ON TENANT&#x2019;S PREMISES




shall be liable for and shall pay
 at least ten (10) days before
delinquency
 all taxes and assessments levied against all personal
property of Tenant located in the Premises. When possible
 Tenant
shall cause its personal property to be assessed and billed
separately from the real property of which the Premises form a
part. If any taxes on Tenant&#x2019;s personal property are levied
against Landlord or Landlord&#x2019;s property
 and if Landlord pays
the same or if the assessed value of Landlord&#x2019;s property is
increased by the inclusion of a value placed upon the personal
property of Tenant
 and if Landlord pays the taxes based upon the
increased assessment
 Tenant shall pay to Landlord the taxes so
levied against Landlord or the proportion of the taxes resulting
from the increase in the assessment. In calculating what portion of
any tax bill which is assessed against Landlord separately or
Landlord and Tenant jointly is attributable to Tenant&#x2019;s
fixtures and personal property
 Landlord&#x2019;s reasonable
determination shall be conclusive.







ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING






Rights of Parties




Notwithstanding any
provision of this Lease to the contrary
 Tenant will neither
voluntarily nor by operation of law assign
 sublet
 encumber or
otherwise transfer all or any part of Tenant&#x2019;s interest in
this Lease or permit the Premises to be occupied by anyone other
than Tenant without Landlord&#x2019;s prior written consent
 which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld in accordance with the
provisions of subparagraph (d) below. Subject to subparagraph (c)
below
 no assignment (whether voluntary
 involuntary or by
operation of law) and no subletting shall be valid or effective
without Landlord&#x2019;s prior written consent and at
Landlord&#x2019;s election shall constitute a material default of
this Lease. Landlord shall not be deemed to have given its consent
to any assignment or subletting by any other course of action
including its acceptance of any name for listing in the Building
directory. To the extent not prohibited by provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code 11 U.S.C. Section 101 et seq. (the Bankruptcy
Code)
 including Section 365(f)(1)
 Tenant
 on behalf of itself and
its creditors
 administrators and assigns
 waives the applicability
of Section 365(e) of the Bankruptcy Code
 unless the proposed
assignee of the Trustee for the estate of the bankrupt meets
Landlord&#x2019;s standard for consent
 as set forth in subparagraph
(d) below. If this Lease is assigned to any person or entity
pursuant to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code
 any and all
monies or other considerations to be delivered in connection with
the assignment
 shall be delivered to Landlord
 shall be and remain
the exclusive property of Landlord
 and shall not constitute
property of Tenant or of the estate of Tenant within the meaning of
the Bankruptcy Code. Any person or entity to which this Lease is
assigned pursuant to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code shall be
deemed to have assumed all of the obligations arising under this
Lease on and after the date of the assignment and shall
 upon
demand
 execute and deliver to Landlord an instrument confirming
that assumption.


If Tenant or
Tenant&#x2019;s guarantor hereunder
 if any
 is a corporation or is
an unincorporated association
 limited liability company or
partnership
 the transfer of any stock or other ownership interest
in the corporation
 association
 or company or partnership
 which
results in a change in the voting control of Tenant or
Tenant&#x2019;s guarantor
 if any
 shall be deemed an assignment
within the meaning and provisions of this Article. In addition
 any
change in the status of the entity
 such as but not limited to the
withdrawal of a general partner
 shall be deemed an assignment
within the meaning of this Article.


Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein
 Tenant
 without the approval of
Landlord (but with thirty [30] days&#x2019; prior written notice
indicating the basis upon which the transaction qualifies as an
Exempt Transfer)
 and without being subject to any right of
Landlord to recapture the Premises
 to receive any portion of the
consideration for the transfer
 or to declare a default of this
Lease
 may assign the Lease
 or sublease the whole of the Premises
to any of the following (each an &#x201C;Exempt Transfer&#x201D;):
(i) any corporation
 limited liability company or other entity
which by virtue of its direct or indirect ownership of the stock
membership interests or other ownership interest
 as applicable
 of
Tenant
 has the power to direct Tenant&#x2019;s management and
operations (&#x201C;Tenant&#x2019;s Parent&#x201D;); (ii) any
corporation
 limited liability company or other entity the
management and operations of which Tenant
 by virtue of
Tenant&#x2019;s direct or indirect ownership of the stock
membership interests or other applicable ownership interest
therein
 has the power to direct; (iii) any corporation
 limited
liability company or other entity the management and operations of
which Tenant&#x2019;s Parent
 by virtue of Tenant&#x2019;s
Parent&#x2019;s direct or indirect ownership of the stock
membership interests or other applicable ownership interest
therein
 has the power to direct
 (iv) any corporation or other
entity in which or with which Tenant
 its successors or assigns
 is
merged or consolidated
 in accordance with applicable statutory
provisions for merger or consolidation
 so long as the liabilities
of the entity participating in such merger or consolidation are
assumed by the entity surviving such merger or created by such
consolidation
 and written acknowledgment of such assumption is
provided to Landlord promptly upon the consummation of such merger
or consolidation; or (v) any corporation or other entity acquiring
all or substantially all of Tenant&#x2019;s assets (including by
means of a purchase of all or substantially all of Tenants stock or
other applicable equity interests)
 so long as the liabilities of
Tenant are assumed by the acquirer of such assets and written
confirmation of such assumption is provided to Landlord
concurrently with Tenant&#x2019;s notice of such acquisition as
required under this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 the
original Tenant (to the extent it remains in existence) shall
remain liable on the Lease after any transfer described in the
preceding sentence
 and in no event shall any such transfer release
Tenant (or its transferee) from the use and/or any other
requirements and obligations under this Lease. In no event shall
the provisions of this Section apply to
 or be used to permit
 a
transaction designed primarily to avoid the requirement of
obtaining Landlord&#x2019;s consent to an assignment or sublease to
a third party (such as
 by way of example and not by way of
limitation
 assignment of this Lease to a single-asset subsidiary
of Tenant and the subsequent merger or consolidation of such
subsidiary with
 or the sale of such subsidiary&#x2019;s assets to
an entity not otherwise related to Tenant).















If Tenant desires
to transfer an interest in this Lease to a corporation or entity
not set forth in subparagraph (c) above
 it shall first notify
Landlord of its desire and shall submit in writing to Landlord: (i)
the name and address of the proposed transferee; (ii) the nature of
any proposed subtenant&#x2019;s or assignee&#x2019;s business to be
carried on in the Premises; (iii) the terms and provisions of any
proposed sublease or assignment; and (iv) any other information
requested by Landlord and reasonably related to the transfer.
Except as provided in subparagraph (e) below
 Landlord shall not
unreasonably withhold its consent provided: (1) the use of the
Premises will be consistent with the provisions of this Lease and
with Landlord&#x2019;s commitment to other tenants of the Building;
(2) fifty percent (50%) of any profit received by the Tenant from
the assignment or subletting
 whether during or after the Lease
Term (after the deduction of Tenant&#x2019;s reasonable
attorneys&#x2019; fees
 brokerage fees and improvement allowances or
other out of pocket economic concessions incurred pursuant to such
assignment or sublease)
 shall be paid to Landlord when received;
(3) at Landlord&#x2019;s election
 insurance requirements shall be
brought into conformity with Landlord&#x2019;s then current leasing
practice; (4) any proposed subtenant or assignee demonstrates that
it is financially responsible by submission to Landlord of all
reasonable information as Landlord may request concerning the
proposed subtenant or assignee
 including but not limited to a
balance sheet of the proposed subtenant or assignee as of a date
within ninety (90) days of the request for Landlord&#x2019;s consent
and statements of income or profit and loss of the proposed
subtenant or assignee for the two-year period preceding the request
for Landlord&#x2019;s consent; (5) any proposed subtenant or
assignee demonstrates to Landlord&#x2019;s reasonable satisfaction a
record of successful experience in business; (6) the proposed
assignee or subtenant is not an existing tenant of the Building;
and (7) the proposed transfer will not impose additional burdens or
adverse tax effects on Landlord. If Landlord consents to the
proposed transfer
 Tenant may
 within ninety (90) days after the
date of the consent
 effect the transfer upon the terms described
in the information furnished to Landlord; provided that any
material change in the terms shall be subject to Landlord&#x2019;s
consent as set forth in this Section. Landlord shall approve or
disapprove any requested transfer within thirty (30) days following
receipt of Tenant&#x2019;s written request and the information set
forth above.


Notwithstanding the
provisions of subparagraphs (a) or (d) above
 in lieu of consenting
to a proposed assignment or subletting
 Landlord may elect to (i)
sublease the Premises (or the portion proposed to be subleased) or
take an assignment of Tenant&#x2019;s interest in this Lease upon
the same terms as offered or marketed to the proposed subtenant or
assignee (excluding terms relating to the purchase of personal
property the use of Tenant&#x2019;s name or the continuation of
Tenant&#x2019;s business); or (ii) terminate this Lease as to the
portion of the Premises proposed to be subleased or assigned with a
proportionate abatement in the rent payable under this Lease
effective on the date that the proposed sublease or assignment
would have become effective. Landlord may
 thereafter
 at its
option
 assign or re-let any space so recaptured to any third
party
 including without limitation the proposed transferee of
Tenant.


If Landlord&#x2019;s
consent to a transfer is required
 Tenant shall pay to Landlord (i)
a transfer analysis fee of One Thousand Dollars ($1
000.00) when
Landlord&#x2019;s consent to such transfer is requested by Tenant
and (ii) Landlord&#x2019;s reasonable attorneys&#x2019; fees and
costs incurred in connection with the transfer.


Tenant agrees that
it shall not assign
 sublease or license
 nor advertise as
available for assignment
 sublease or license
 nor list with any
broker for assignment
 sublease or license
 all or any portion of
the Premises for a consideration which is less than the fair market
rental value
 as determined by Landlord in its reasonable
discretion
 for comparable space in the Building for a comparable
term commencing concurrently with the assignment
 sublease or
license term
 with comparable rent credits and tenant improvement
allowances
 if any. Within 10 days after Landlord receives any
written request from Tenant for Landlord&#x2019;s estimate of the
fair market rental value for specified space
 which request shall
identify the space in question
 the proposed term and the proposed
rent credits and improvement allowances
 Landlord shall notify
Tenant in writing of the fair market rental value for such space
for a comparable term with comparable rent credits and tenant
improvement allowances
 if any.






Effect of Transfer






subletting or assignment
 even with the consent of Landlord
 shall
relieve Tenant of its obligation to pay Base Rent and Additional
Rent and to perform all its other obligations under this Lease.
Moreover
 Tenant shall indemnify
 defend
 protect and hold Landlord
harmless
 as provided in Section 10.3
 for any act or omission by
an assignee or subtenant. Each assignee
 other than Landlord
 shall
be deemed to assume all obligations of Tenant under this Lease and
shall be liable
 jointly and severally
 with Tenant for the payment
of all Base Rent and Additional Rent and for the due performance of
all of Tenant&#x2019;s obligations under this Lease. No transfer
shall be binding on Landlord unless any document memorializing the
transfer is delivered to Landlord and both the assignee/subtenant
and Tenant deliver to Landlord an executed consent to transfer
instrument prepared by Landlord and consistent with the
requirements of this Article. The acceptance by Landlord of any
payment due under this Lease from any other person shall not be
deemed to be a waiver by Landlord of any provision of this Lease or
to be a consent to any transfer. Consent by Landlord to one or more
transfers shall not operate as a waiver or estoppel to the future
enforcement by Landlord of its rights under this
Lease.



















Sublease Requirements






following terms and conditions shall apply to any subletting by
Tenant of all or any part of the Premises and shall be included in
each sublease:


Tenant hereby
irrevocably assigns to Landlord all of Tenant&#x2019;s interest in
all rentals and income arising from any sublease of the Premises
and Landlord may collect such rent and income and apply same toward
Tenant&#x2019;s obligations under this Lease; provided
 however
that until a default occurs in the performance of Tenant&#x2019;s
obligations under this Lease
 Tenant shall have the right to
receive and collect the sublease rentals. Landlord shall not
 by
reason of this assignment or the collection of sublease rentals
 be
deemed liable to the subtenant for the performance of any of
Tenant&#x2019;s obligations under the sublease. Tenant hereby
irrevocably authorizes and directs any subtenant
 upon receipt of a
written notice from Landlord stating that an uncured default exists
in the performance of Tenant&#x2019;s obligations under this Lease
to pay to Landlord all sums then and thereafter due under the
sublease. Tenant agrees that the subtenant may rely on that notice
without any duty of further inquiry and notwithstanding any notice
or claim by Tenant to the contrary. Tenant shall have no right or
claim against the subtenant or Landlord for any rentals so paid to
Landlord.


In the event of the
termination of this Lease
 Landlord may
 at its sole option
 take
over Tenant&#x2019;s entire interest in any sublease and
 upon
notice from Landlord
 the subtenant shall attorn to Landlord. In no
event
 however
 shall Landlord be liable for any previous act or
omission by Tenant under the sublease or for the return of any
advance rental payments or deposits under the sublease that have
not been actually delivered to Landlord
 nor shall Landlord be
bound by any sublease modification executed without
Landlord&#x2019;s consent or for any advance rental payment by the
subtenant in excess of one month&#x2019;s sublease rental. The
general provisions of this Lease
 including without limitation
those pertaining to insurance and indemnification
 shall be deemed
incorporated by reference into the sublease despite the termination
of this Lease.


Tenant agrees that
Landlord may
 at its sole option
 authorize a subtenant of the
Premises to cure a default by Tenant under this Lease. Should
Landlord accept such cure
 the subtenant shall have a right of
reimbursement and offset from and against Tenant under the
applicable sublease.







INSURANCE AND INDEMNITY





D







DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION






Restoration




If the Building of
which the Premises are a part is damaged
 Landlord shall repair
that damage as soon as reasonably possible at its expense unless:
(i) the damage is not covered by Landlord&#x2019;s fire and extended
coverage insurance (or by a normal extended coverage policy
 should
Landlord fail to carry that insurance); or (ii) Landlord reasonably
determines that the cost of repair would exceed twenty-five percent
(25%) of the full replacement cost of the Building (Replacement
Cost); or (iii) Landlord reasonably determines that the cost of
repair would exceed ten percent (10%) of the Replacement Cost and
the damage occurs during the final twelve (12) months of the Lease
Term. Should Landlord elect not to repair the damage for one of the
preceding reasons
 Landlord shall so notify Tenant in writing
within sixty- (60) days after the damage occurs
 and this Lease
shall be deemed terminated as of: (a) if Tenant has continued its
use and occupancy
 and is using and occupying the Premises as of
the date of such notice from Landlord
 the thirtieth (30th) day
following such notice
 or (b) if Tenant continued to use and occupy
the Premises after the casualty but ceased such use and occupancy
prior to the date of such notice by Landlord
 the date on which
Tenant ceased its use and occupancy of the Premises
 or (c) if
Tenant ceased its occupancy and use of the Premises on or before
the date of the casualty
 the date of the casualty.















Unless Landlord
elects to terminate this Lease in accordance with subsection (a)
above
 this Lease shall continue in effect for the remainder of the
Lease Term; provided that if the damage is so extensive as to
reasonably prevent Tenant&#x2019;s substantial use and enjoyment of
the Premises for more than nine (9) months
 then Tenant may elect
to terminate this Lease by written notice to Landlord within the
sixty- (60)-day period stated in subsection (a).


Commencing on the
date of any damage to the Building and ending on the sooner of the
date the damage is repaired or the date this Lease is terminated
the Monthly Rental to be paid under this Lease shall be abated in
the same proportion that the floor area of the Premises that is
rendered unusable by the damage from time to time bears to the
total floor area of the Premises.


Notwithstanding the
provisions of subsections (a) (b) and (c) of this Section
 but
subject to the provisions of subsection (e) below
 the cost of any
repairs shall be borne by Tenant and Tenant shall not be entitled
to rental abatement or termination rights if the damage is due to
the fault or neglect of Tenant or its employees
 subtenants
invitees or representatives. In addition
 the provisions of this
Section shall not be deemed to require Landlord to repair any
improvements or fixtures that Tenant is obligated to repair or
insure pursuant to any other provision of this Lease.


Notwithstanding any
provision herein to the contrary
 Landlord and Tenant each hereby
waives any and all rights of recovery
 claim
 action or cause of
action
 against the other
 its agents
 officers
 employees
partners
 servants or shareholders for any insured loss or damage
that may occur to the Leased Premises
 or any improvements thereto
or said Building of which the Leased Premises are a part
 or any
improvements thereto
 or any personal property of such party
therein
 by reason of fire
 the elements
 or any other cause which
is insured against under the terms of standard commercial casualty
risk property insurance policy maintained by Landlord or Tenant

INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OF THE OTHER PARTY HERETO
 ITS AGENTS
OFFICERS
 EMPLOYEES
 PARTNERS

each party shall cause such insurance policies to contain
provisions or endorsements wherein each insurer waives its rights
of recovery against such parties.






Lease Governs






agrees that the provisions of this Lease
 including without
limitation Section 11.1
 shall govern any damage or destruction and
shall accordingly supersede any contrary statute or rule of
law.







EMINENT DOMAIN






Temporary Taking






or a material portion of the Premises is taken by any lawful
authority by exercise of the right of eminent domain or sold to
prevent a taking
 either Tenant or Landlord may terminate this
Lease effective as of the date possession is required to be
surrendered to the authority. In the event title to a portion of
the Building
 other than the Premises
 is taken or sold in lieu of
taking
 and if Landlord elects to restore the Building in such a
way as to alter the Premises materially
 either party may terminate
this Lease by written notice to the other party effective on the
date of vesting of title. In the event neither party has elected to
terminate this Lease as provided above
 then Landlord shall
promptly
 after receipt of a sufficient condemnation award
 proceed
to restore the Premises to substantially their condition prior to
the taking and a proportionate allowance shall be made to Tenant
for the Monthly Rental corresponding to the time during which and
to the part of the Premises of which Tenant is deprived on account
of the taking and restoration. In the event of a taking
 Landlord
shall be entitled to the entire amount of the condemnation award
without deduction for any estate or interest of Tenant; provided
that nothing in this Section shall be deemed to give Landlord any
interest in or prevent Tenant from seeking any award against the
taking authority for the taking of personal property and fixtures
belonging to Tenant or for relocation or business interruption
expenses recoverable from the taking authority.






Total or Partial Taking






temporary taking of the Premises shall terminate this Lease or give
Tenant any right to abatement of rent
 and any award specifically
attributable to a temporary taking of the Premises shall belong
entirely to Tenant. A temporary taking shall be deemed to be a
taking of the use or occupancy of the Premises for a period not to
exceed ninety (90) days.




















SUBORDINATION; ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE






Total Condemnation of Premises




At the option of
Landlord this Lease shall be either superior or subordinate to all
ground or underlying leases
 mortgages and deeds of trust
 if any
which may hereafter affect the Building
 and to all renewals
modifications
 consolidations
 replacements and extensions thereof;
provided that so long as Tenant is not in default under this Lease
this Lease shall not be terminated or Tenant&#x2019;s quiet
enjoyment of the Premises disturbed in the event of termination of
any such ground or underlying lease or the foreclosure of any such
mortgage or deed of trust to which Tenant has subordinated this
Lease pursuant to this Section. In the event of a termination or
foreclosure
 Tenant shall become a tenant of and attorn to the
successor-in-interest to Landlord upon the same terms and
conditions as are contained in this Lease and shall execute any
instrument reasonably required by Landlord&#x2019;s successor for
that purpose. Tenant shall also
 upon written request of Landlord
execute and deliver all instruments as may be required from time to
time to subordinate the rights of Tenant under this Lease to any
ground or underlying lease or to the lien of any mortgage or deed
of trust or
 if requested by Landlord
 to subordinate in whole or
in part any ground or underlying lease or the lien of any mortgage
or deed of trust to this Lease.


Failure of Tenant
to execute any statements or instruments necessary or desirable to
effectuate the provisions of this Article within ten (10) days
after written request by Landlord
 in any form that Landlord may
reasonably require
 shall constitute a material default under this
Lease. In that event
 Landlord
 in addition to any other rights or
remedies it might have
 shall have the right by written notice to
Tenant to terminate this Lease as of a date not less than twenty
(20) days after the date of Landlord&#x2019;s notice.
Landlord&#x2019;s election to terminate shall not relieve Tenant of
any liability for its default.

any time upon not less than ten (10) days prior written notice from
Landlord
 execute
 acknowledge and deliver to Landlord
 in any form
that Landlord may reasonably require (including one substantially

 and the dates to
which the Base Rent and Additional Rent have been paid in advance
if any; and (ii) acknowledging that to Tenant&#x2019;s knowledge
there are no uncured defaults on the part of Landlord or specifying
each default
 if any
 are claimed; and (iii) setting forth all
further information that Landlord may reasonably require.
Tenant&#x2019;s statement may be relied upon by any prospective
purchaser or encumbrancer of all or any portion of the
Building.

failure to deliver any estoppel statement within the provided time
shall constitute a default under this Lease and shall be conclusive
upon Tenant that (i) this Lease is in full force and effect without
modification
 except as may be represented by Landlord; (ii) there
are no uncured defaults in Landlord&#x2019;s performance; and (iii)
not more than one month&#x2019;s Monthly Rental has been paid in
advance.

Rent required to be made by Tenant
 as and when due
 where such
failure continues for more than five (5) days after written notice
from Landlord of the delinquency thereof; provided

 that any such notice shall constitute
and/or be in lieu of and not in addition to any notice required
under applicable law. However
 if the nature of the failure is such
that more than fifteen (15) days are reasonably required for its

 then Tenant shall not be deemed to be in default if Tenant
commences the cure within fifteen (15) days and thereafter
diligently pursues the cure to completion.

Landlord&#x2019;s Remedies






event of any default by Tenant or in the event of the abandonment
of the Premises by Tenant
 then
 in addition to any other remedies
available to Landlord
 Landlord may exercise the following
remedies:


Landlord may
terminate Tenant&#x2019;s right to possession of the Premises by any
lawful means in which case this Lease shall terminate and Tenant
shall immediately surrender possession of the Premises to Landlord.
Such termination shall not affect any accrued obligations of Tenant
under this Lease. Upon termination
 Landlord shall have the right
to reenter the Premises and remove all persons and property.
Landlord shall also be entitled to recover from
Tenant:




worth at the time of award of the unpaid Base Rent and Additional
Rent which had been earned at the time of termination;




worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Base
Rent and Additional Rent
 which would have been earned after
termination until the time of award
 exceeds the amount of such
loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably
avoided;

















worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Base
Rent and Additional Rent for the balance of the Term after the time
of award exceeds the amount of such loss that Tenant proves could
be reasonably avoided;




other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all the detriment
proximately caused by Tenant&#x2019;s failure to perform its
obligations under this Lease or which
 in the ordinary course of
things
 would be likely to result from Tenant&#x2019;s default
including but not limited to the cost of recovering possession of
the Premises
 commissions and other expenses of reletting
including necessary repair
 renovation
 improvement and alteration
of the Premises for a new tenant
 the unamortized portion of any
tenant improvements and brokerage commissions funded by Landlord in
connection with this Lease
 reasonable attorneys&#x2019; fees and
any other reasonable costs; and




limiting Landlord&#x2019;s rights under this Lease
 in the event of
Tenant&#x2019;s default
 all of Tenant&#x2019;s merchandise
furniture
 fixtures
 equipment and other personal property shall
at Landlord&#x2019;s option (i) remain on the Premises and
continuing during the length of such default
 Landlord shall have
the right to take the exclusive possession of same and to use the
same free of rent or charge until all defaults have been cured
(ii) be removed by Landlord from the Premises and placed in storage
at a public warehouse at the expense and risk of Tenant
 or (iii)
be removed by Tenant on demand by Landlord.


At Landlord&#x2019;s
election all other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the
foregoing as may be permitted by law. Any sum other than Base Rent
shall be computed on the basis of the average monthly amount
accruing during the twenty-four (24) month period immediately prior
to default
 except that if it becomes necessary to compute such
Additional Rent before the twenty-four (24) month period has
occurred
 then the computation shall be on the basis of the average
monthly amount during the shorter period. As used in subparagraphs
(1) and (2) above
 the worth at the time of award shall be computed
by allowing interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum. As
used in subparagraph (3) above
 the worth at the time of award
shall be computed by discounting the amount at the discount rate of
the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus
one percent (1%).



Landlord may elect
not to terminate Tenant&#x2019;s right to possession of the Premises
in which event Landlord may continue to enforce all of its rights
and remedies under this Lease
 including the right to collect all
Base Rent and Additional Rent as it becomes due. Efforts by the
Landlord to maintain
 preserve or relet the Premises
 or the
appointment of a receiver to protect the Landlord&#x2019;s interests
under this Lease
 shall not constitute a termination of the
Tenant&#x2019;s right to possession of the Premises. In the event
that Landlord elects to avail itself of the remedy provided by this
subsection (ii)
 Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold its
consent to an assignment or subletting of the Premises subject to
the reasonable standards for Landlord&#x2019;s consent as are
contained in this Lease.



Landlord shall be
under no obligation to observe or perform any covenant of this
Lease on its part to be observed or performed which accrues after
the date of any default by Tenant unless and until the default is
cured by Tenant. The various rights and remedies reserved to
Landlord in this Lease or otherwise shall be cumulative and
 except
as otherwise provided by applicable law
 Landlord may pursue any or
all of its rights and remedies at the same time.


No delay or
omission of Landlord to exercise any right or remedy shall be
construed as a waiver of the right or remedy or of any default by
Tenant. The acceptance by Landlord of any Base Rent or Additional
Rent shall not be a (i) waiver of any preceding breach or default
by Tenant of any provision of this Lease
 other than the failure of
Tenant to pay the particular Base Rent or Additional Rent accepted
regardless of Landlord&#x2019;s knowledge of the preceding breach or
default at the time of acceptance of such payment; or (ii) a waiver
of Landlord&#x2019;s right to exercise any remedy available to
Landlord by virtue of the breach or default. The acceptance of any
payment from a debtor-in-possession
 a trustee
 a receiver or any
other person acting on behalf of Tenant or Tenant&#x2019;s estate
shall not waive or cure a default under Section 14.1. No payment by
Tenant or receipt by Landlord of a lesser amount than the Base Rent
and Additional Rent required by this Lease shall be deemed to be
other than a partial payment on account of the earliest due
stipulated Base Rent or Additional Rent
 nor shall any endorsement
or statement on any check or letter be deemed an accord and
satisfaction
 and Landlord shall accept the check or payment
without prejudice to Landlord&#x2019;s right to recover the balance
of the Base Rent or Additional Rent or pursue any other remedy
available to it. No act or thing done by Landlord or
Landlord&#x2019;s agents during the Lease Term shall be deemed an
acceptance of surrender of the Premises
 and no agreement to accept
a surrender shall be valid unless in writing and signed by
Landlord. No employee of Landlord or of Landlord&#x2019;s agents
shall have any power to accept the keys to the Premises prior to
the termination of this Lease and the delivery of the keys to any
employee shall not operate as a termination of the Lease or a
surrender of the Premises.






Late Payments






Base Rent or Additional Rent due under this Lease that is not paid
to Landlord within five (5) days of the date when due shall bear
interest at eighteen percent (18%) per annum from the date due
until fully paid. The payment of interest shall not cure any
default by Tenant under this Lease. In addition
 Tenant
acknowledges that the late payment by Tenant to Landlord of Base
Rent or Additional Rent will cause Landlord to incur costs not
contemplated by this Lease
 the exact amount of which will be
extremely difficult and impracticable to ascertain. Those costs may
include
 but are not limited to
 administrative
 processing and
accounting charges
 and late charges which may be imposed on
Landlord by the terms of any ground lease mortgage or trust deed
covering the Premises. Accordingly
 if any Base Rent or Additional
Rent due from Tenant shall not be received by Landlord or
Landlord&#x2019;s designee within five (5) days after the date due
then Tenant shall pay to Landlord
 in addition to the interest
provided above
 a late charge in an amount equal to ten percent
(10%) of each delinquent payment. Acceptance of a late charge by
Landlord shall not constitute a waiver of Tenant&#x2019;s default
with respect to the overdue amount nor shall it prevent Landlord
from exercising any of its other rights and remedies.

















each second consecutive installment of Monthly Rental that is not
paid within five (5) days of the date when due
 Landlord shall have
the option (i) to require that beginning with the first payment of
Monthly Rental next due
 Monthly Rental shall no longer be paid in
monthly installments but shall be payable quarterly three (3)
months in advance; and/or (ii) to require that Tenant increase the
amount
 if any
 of the Security Deposit by one hundred percent
(100%). Should Tenant deliver to Landlord
 at any time during the
Lease Term
 two (2) or more insufficient checks
 the Landlord may
require that all monies then and thereafter due from Tenant be paid
to Landlord by cashier&#x2019;s check.






Right of Landlord to Perform






covenants and agreements to be performed by Tenant under this Lease
shall be performed at Tenant&#x2019;s sole cost and expense and
without any abatement of Base Rent or Additional Rent or right of
set-off. If Tenant fails to pay any sum of money other than Monthly
Rental or fails to perform any other act on its part to be
performed under this Lease
 and the failure continues beyond any
applicable grace period set forth in Section 14.1
 then
 in
addition to any other available remedies
 Landlord may
 at its
election
 make the payment or perform the other act on
Tenant&#x2019;s part. Landlord&#x2019;s election to make the payment
or perform the act on Tenant&#x2019;s part shall not give rise to
any responsibility of Landlord to continue making the same or
similar payments or performing the same or similar acts. Tenant
shall promptly
 upon demand by Landlord
 reimburse Landlord for all
sums paid by Landlord and all necessary incidental costs together
with interest at the maximum rate permitted by law from the date of
the payment by Landlord. Landlord shall have the same rights and
remedies if Tenant fails to pay those amounts as Landlord would
have in the event of a default by Tenant in the payment of Base
Rent or Additional Rent.






Default by Landlord






be deemed to be in default in the performance of any obligation
under this Lease unless and until it has failed to perform the
obligation within thirty (30) days after written notice by Tenant
to Landlord specifying in reasonable detail the nature and extent
of the failure; provided
 however
 that if the nature of
Landlord&#x2019;s obligation is such that more than thirty (30) days
are required for its performance
 then Landlord shall not be deemed
to be in default if it commences performance within the
thirty-(30)-day period and thereafter diligently pursues the cure
to completion. The directors
 officers
 shareholders and employees
of Landlord shall not be personally liable for any claim or
judgment against Landlord under any circumstances. If Landlord is
in default under this Lease
 then Tenant's remedies shall be only
to seek a money judgment against Landlord
 or an action for
specific performance and/or declaratory relief against Landlord
but in no event shall Tenant have the remedy of a termination of
this Lease. In the event Tenant seeks a money judgment against
Landlord
 Tenant shall not attempt to seize or attach any asset of
Landlord except as otherwise provided herein. If Tenant recovers a
money judgment against Landlord
 then such judgment shall be
satisfied only out of the proceeds of the sale received on
execution of the judgment levied against the right
 title and
interest of the Landlord in the Building or out of rent or other
income from the Building received or to be received by the
Landlord. Tenant shall not attempt to satisfy any such judgment
from any other asset of Landlord under any circumstances. Tenant
acknowledges that this limitation on Landlord's liability has been
separately bargained for and that Landlord would not enter into
this Lease in the absence of this provision.






EXPENSES AND LEGAL FEES






either Landlord or Tenant bring any action in connection with this
Lease
 the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
 as part
of the action
 its reasonable attorneys&#x2019; fees and all other
costs. The prevailing party
 for the purpose of this paragraph
shall be determined by the trier of the facts.






WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL






EACH ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS AWARE OF AND HAS HAD THE ADVICE OF
COUNSEL OF ITS CHOICE WITH RESPECT TO ITS RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY
AND EACH PARTY DOES HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVE AND
RELEASE
 TO THE FULLEST EXTENT NOW OR HEREAFTER PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW
 ALL SUCH RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY EITHER PARTY HERETO AGAINST
THE OTHER ON ANY MATTERS WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY
CONNECTED WITH THIS LEASE
 TENANT'S USE OR OCCUPANCY OF THE
PREMISES AND/OR ANY CLAIM OF INJURY OR DAMAGE.


































END OF TERM






Holding Over






Lease shall terminate without further notice upon the expiration of
the Lease Term
 and any holding over by Tenant after the expiration
shall not constitute a renewal or extension of this Lease or give
Tenant any rights under this Lease
 except when in writing signed
by both parties. If Tenant holds over for any period after the
expiration (or earlier termination) of the Lease Term
 Landlord
may
 at its option
 treat Tenant as a tenant at sufferance only
commencing on the first (1st) day following the termination of this
Lease and subject to all of the terms of this Lease
 except that
the Monthly Rental shall be one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of
the total Monthly Rental for the month immediately preceding the
date of termination. If Tenant fails to surrender the Premises upon
the expiration of this Lease
 despite demand to do so by Landlord
Tenant shall indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from all loss or
liability
 including without limitation any claims made by any
succeeding tenant relating to such failure to surrender. Acceptance
by Landlord of Base Rent or Additional Rent after the termination
shall not constitute a consent to a holdover or result in a renewal
of this Lease. The foregoing provisions of this Section are in
addition to and do not affect Landlord's right of re-entry or any
other rights of Landlord under this Lease or at law.






Merger on Termination






voluntary or other surrender of this Lease by Tenant or a mutual
termination of this Lease shall terminate any or all existing
subleases unless Landlord
 at its option
 elects in writing to
treat the surrender or termination as an assignment to it of any or
all subleases affecting the Premises.






Surrender of Premises; Removal of Property






the Expiration Date or upon any earlier termination of this Lease
Tenant shall quit and surrender possession of the Premises to
Landlord in as good order
 condition and repair as when received or
as hereafter may be improved by Landlord or Tenant

and tear and repairs which are Landlord&#x2019;s obligation
excepted
 and shall
 without expense to Landlord
 remove or cause
to be removed from the Premises all personal property and debris
except for any items that Landlord may by written authorization
allow to remain. Tenant shall repair all damage to the Premises
resulting from the removal
 which repair shall include the patching
and filling of holes and repair of structural damage
 provided that
Landlord may instead elect to repair any structural damage at
Tenant&#x2019;s expense. If Tenant shall fail to comply with the
provisions of this Section
 Landlord may affect the removal and/or
make any repairs
 and the cost to Landlord shall be Additional Rent
payable by Tenant upon demand. If requested by Landlord
 Tenant
shall execute
 acknowledge and deliver to Landlord an instrument in
writing releasing and quitclaiming to Landlord all right
 title and
interest of Tenant in the Premises.




















PAYMENTS AND NOTICES

or offset in lawful money of the United States to Landlord at its

any other place as Landlord may designate in writing. Unless this
Lease expressly provides otherwise

other served in the manner provided in this Article
 designate a

served when actually delivered to the applicable address (or when
such delivery is refused) using any of the above- enumerated
delivery methods. If more than one person or entity is named as
Tenant under this Lease service of any notice upon any one of them
shall be deemed as service upon all of them.

Landlord for the safety
 care
 security
 good order or cleanliness
of the Premises
 Building
 and Common Facilities. Landlord shall
not be liable to Tenant for any violation of the Rules and
Regulations or the breach of any covenant or condition in any lease
by any other tenant. One or more waivers by Landlord of any breach
of the Rules and Regulations by Tenant or by any other tenant(s)
shall not be a waiver of any subsequent breach of that rule or any
other. Tenant&#x2019;s failure to keep and observe the Rules and
Regulations shall constitute a default under this Lease. In the
case of any conflict between the Rules and Regulations and this
Lease
 this Lease shall be controlling.







BROKER&#x2019;S COMMISSION




parties recognize as the broker(s) who negotiated this Lease the
firms
 if any
 whose names are stated in Item 10 of the Basic Lease
Provisions and agree that Landlord shall be responsible for the
payment of brokerage commissions to those brokers unless otherwise
provided in this Lease. Tenant warrants that it has had no dealings
with any other real estate broker or agent in connection with the
negotiation of this Lease and Tenant agrees to indemnify and hold
Landlord harmless from any cost expense or liability (including
reasonable attorneys&#x2019; fees) for any compensation
 commissions
or charges claimed by any other real estate broker or agent
employed or claiming to represent or to have been employed by
Tenant in connection with the negotiation of this Lease. The
foregoing agreement shall survive the termination of this Lease. If
Tenant fails to take possession of the Premises or if this Lease
otherwise terminates prior to the Expiration Date as the result of
failure of performance by Tenant
 Landlord shall be entitled to
recover from Tenant the unamortized portion of any brokerage
commission funded by Landlord in addition to any other damages to
which Landlord may be entitled.







TRANSFER OF LANDLORD&#x2019;S INTEREST




event of any transfer of Landlord&#x2019;s Interest in the Premises
the transferor shall be automatically relieved of all obligations
on the part of Landlord accruing under this Lease from and after
the date of the transfer
 provided that any funds held by the
transferor
 in which Tenant has an interest
 shall be turned over
subject to that interest to the transferee
 and Tenant is notified
of the transfer as required by law. No holder of a mortgage and/or
deed of trust to which this Lease is or may be subordinate
 and no
landlord under a so-called sale-leaseback
 shall be responsible in
connection with the Security Deposit unless the mortgagee or holder
of the deed of trust or the landlord actually receives the Security
Deposit. It is intended that the covenants and obligations
contained in this Lease on the part of Landlord shall subject to
the foregoing

 Serif&gt;Further,&#13;Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial&#13;accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared&#13;effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &amp;#8220;Exchange&#13;Act&amp;#8221;)) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company&#13;can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies&#13;but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company previously elected to opt out of such extended transition period&#13;which means that the Company must adopt new or revised accounting standards at the same time public companies are required to&#13;adopt the new or revised standard. The Company currently expects to retain its status as an emerging growth company until the&#13;year ending December 31, 2021, but this status could end sooner under certain circumstances.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;The&#13;preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make judgments,&#13;assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The&#13;Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes&#13;are reasonable under the circumstances, to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent&#13;from other sources. The Company&amp;#8217;s significant accounting estimates include, but are not necessarily limited to, estimated&#13;useful lives for identifiable intangible assets and property and equipment, impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, valuation&#13;assumptions for stock options, warrants and equity instruments issued for goods or services, the allowance for doubtful accounts&#13;receivable, inventory obsolescence, the allowance for sales returns and chargebacks, deferred income taxes and the related valuation&#13;allowances, and the evaluation and measurement of contingencies. To the extent there are material differences between the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;estimates and the actual results, the Company&amp;#8217;s future consolidated results of operation will be affected.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

In the event that&#13;the Company does not successfully execute its business plan, certain assets may not be recoverable, certain liabilities may not&#13;be paid and investments in its capital stock may not be recoverable. The Company&amp;#8217;s success depends upon the acceptance of&#13;its expertise in providing services, development of sales and distribution channels, and its ability to generate significant net&#13;revenue and cash flows from the use of this expertise.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;The&#13;Company records a provision for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and a detailed assessment of the collectability&#13;of its accounts receivable. In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company considers, among other factors, the&#13;aging of the accounts receivable, its historical write-offs, the credit worthiness of customers, and general economic conditions.&#13;Account balances are charged against the allowance when the Company believes that it is probable that the receivable will not&#13;be recovered. Actual write-offs may either be in excess or less than the estimated allowance. Recoveries of any accounts receivable&#13;previously written off are recorded as a reduction of expense when received.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;Goodwill&#13;represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets&#13;acquired. Goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but tested for impairment annually or&#13;more frequently when events or circumstances indicates that the carrying value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds&#13;its fair value. The goodwill impairment test is applied by performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value&#13;of the reporting unit. If, on the basis of qualitative factors, it is considered more likely than not that the fair value of the&#13;reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount, further testing of goodwill for impairment is not required. If the carrying&#13;amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit&amp;#8217;s fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal&#13;to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company performed a qualitative&#13;assessment and determined there was no impairment of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;In&#13;    order to more closely reflect the estimated economic life of the license agreement acquired in the June 2017 acquisition of&#13;    Marley, the Company revised the estimated useful life from 42 years to 15 years during the fourth quarter of 2018. The carrying&#13;    value of this license was approximately $5.7 million, and the impact of the change in estimate resulted in an additional $64,000&#13;    of amortization expense for the fourth quarter of 2018&amp;#160;whereby the change to earnings per share was immaterial. For the&#13;    year ending December 31, 2019, total amortization expense related to this license agreement is expected to be approximately&#13;    $0.4 million as compared to approximately $0.2 million that was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#13;&lt;/table&gt;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;Long-lived&#13;assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not&#13;be recoverable. Impairment exists for property and equipment and other long-lived assets if the carrying amounts of such assets&#13;exceed the estimates of future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such assets. An impairment charge is recognized&#13;for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset, or asset group, exceeds its fair value. No impairment of long-lived&#13;assets occurred in the years presented.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;The&#13;Company determines if contractual arrangements are considered a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating&#13;lease right-of-use (&amp;#8220;ROU&amp;#8221;) assets, whereas assets related to finance leases are included in property and equipment.&#13;The corresponding liabilities related to ROU assets and assets under financing leases are included in accrued liabilities and&#13;other long-term liabilities in the Company&amp;#8217;s consolidated balance sheets, based on the related contractual maturities. ROU&#13;assets represent the Company&amp;#8217;s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the related&#13;obligations to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease&#13;commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. None of the Company&amp;#8217;s leases provide&#13;an implicit interest rate, which requires use of the Company&amp;#8217;s estimated incremental borrowing rate to determine the present&#13;value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;When&#13;lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease that are reasonably certain to be exercised, the ROU calculations&#13;give effect to such options. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Some&#13;of the Company&amp;#8217;s lease agreements contain lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately.&#13;However, for certain leases, the Company elects to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.&#13;Additionally, for certain equipment leases, the Company applies a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating&#13;lease ROU assets and liabilities.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;Debt&#13;issuance costs incurred to obtain new debt financing or modify existing debt financing consist of incremental direct costs incurred&#13;for professional fees and due diligence services, including reimbursement of similar costs incurred by the lenders. Amounts paid&#13;to the lenders when a financing is consummated are a reduction of the proceeds and are treated as a debt discount. Except for&#13;revolving lines of credit, debt issuance costs and discounts are presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as&#13;a reduction in the carrying value of the debt and are accreted to interest expense using the effective interest method. Debt issuance&#13;costs related to revolving lines of credit are presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a long-term asset&#13;and are amortized using the straight-line method over the contractual term of the debt agreement. Unamortized deferred debt issuance&#13;costs are not charged to expense when the related debt becomes a demand obligation due to the violation of terms so long as it&#13;is probable that the lenders will either waive the violation or will agree to amend or restructure the terms of the indebtedness.&#13;If either circumstance is probable, the deferred debt issuance costs continue to be amortized over the remaining term of the initial&#13;amortization period. If it is not probable, the costs will be charged to expense.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;The&#13;Company measures the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for all equity awards granted, including stock&#13;options, based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date. The Company computes the fair value of options using&#13;the Black-Scholes-Merton (&amp;#8220;BSM&amp;#8221;) option pricing model. The Company recognizes the cost of the equity awards over the&#13;period that services are provided to earn the award, usually the vesting period. For awards granted which contain a graded vesting&#13;schedule, and the only condition for vesting is a service condition, compensation cost is recognized as an expense on a straight-line&#13;basis over the requisite service period as if the award was, in substance, a single award. The Company recognizes the impact of&#13;forfeitures in the period that the forfeiture occurs, rather than estimating the number of awards that are not expected to vest&#13;in accounting for stock-based compensation.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;When&#13;the Company enters into a financial instrument such as a debt or equity agreement (the &amp;#8220;host contract&amp;#8221;), the Company&#13;assesses whether the economic characteristics of any embedded features are clearly and closely related to the primary economic&#13;characteristics of the remainder of the host contract. When it is determined that (i) an embedded feature possesses economic characteristics&#13;that are not clearly and closely related to the primary economic characteristics of the host contract, and (ii) a separate, stand-alone&#13;instrument with the same terms would meet the definition of a financial derivative instrument, then the embedded feature is bifurcated&#13;from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative instrument. The estimated fair value of the derivative feature is recorded&#13;separately from the carrying value of the host contract, with subsequent changes in the estimated fair value recorded as a non-operating&#13;gain or loss in the Company&amp;#8217;s consolidated statements of operations.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;The&#13;Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities&#13;are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using&#13;enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Realization&#13;of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely&#13;than not that some portion or all of a deferred income tax asset will not be realized based on the weight of available evidence,&#13;including expected future earnings.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;The&#13;Company recognizes an uncertain tax position in its financial statements when it concludes that a tax position is more likely&#13;than not to be sustained upon examination based solely on its technical merits. Only after a tax position passes the first step&#13;of recognition will measurement be required. Under the measurement step, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of&#13;benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon effective settlement. This is determined on a cumulative probability&#13;basis. The full impact of any change in recognition or measurement is reflected in the period in which such change occurs. Interest&#13;and penalties related to income taxes are recognized in the provision for income taxes.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

The resulting net foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated&#13;other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders&amp;#8217; equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and&#13;losses from foreign currency transactions and remeasurement gains (losses) on short-term intercompany borrowings, are recorded&#13;in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Instead, under this ASU, an entity would perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the&#13;fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying&#13;amount exceeds the reporting unit&amp;#8217;s fair value; however, the loss recognized is not to exceed the total amount of goodwill&#13;allocated to that reporting unit. In addition, income tax effects will be considered, if applicable. This ASU is effective for&#13;fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019.

 Serif&gt;On&#13;December 2, 2018, the Company entered into a Plan of Merger (the &amp;#8220;Merger Agreement&amp;#8221;) with Morinda and New Age Health&#13;Sciences Holdings, Inc., a newly formed Utah corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (&amp;#8220;Merger Sub&amp;#8221;).&#13;On December 21, 2018 (the &amp;#8220;Closing Date&amp;#8221;), the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were completed.

 Serif&gt;Pursuant&#13;to the Merger Agreement, the Company paid to Morinda&amp;#8217;s equity holders (i) $75.0 million in cash; (ii) 2,016,480 shares of&#13;the Company&amp;#8217;s Common Stock with an estimated fair value on the closing Date of approximately $11.0 million, (iii) 43,804&#13;shares of Series D Preferred Stock (the &amp;#8220;Preferred Stock&amp;#8221;) providing for the potential payment of up to $15 million&#13;contingent upon Morinda achieving certain post-closing milestones, as discussed below.&amp;#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;Pursuant&#13;to the Certificate of Designations of Series D Preferred Stock (the &amp;#8220;CoD&amp;#8221;), the holders of the Preferred Stock are&#13;entitled to receive a dividend of up to an aggregate of $15.0 million (the &amp;#8220;Milestone Dividend&amp;#8221;) if the Adjusted EBITDA&#13;(as defined in the CoD) of Morinda is at least $20.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2019. The Milestone Dividend is&#13;payable on April 15, 2020. If the Adjusted EBITDA of Morinda is less than $20.0 million, the Milestone Dividend shall be reduced&#13;by applying a five-times multiple to the difference between the Adjusted EBITDA target of $20 million and actual Adjusted EBITDA&#13;for the year ending December 31, 2019. Accordingly, no Milestone Dividend is payable if actual Adjusted EBITDA is $17.0 million&#13;or lower. Additionally, the Company is required to pay quarterly dividends to the holders of the Preferred Stock at a rate of&#13;1.5% per annum of the Milestone Dividend amount, payable on a pro rata basis. The Company may pay the Milestone Dividend and /or&#13;the annual dividend in cash or in kind, provided that if the Company chooses to pay in kind, the shares of Common Stock issued&#13;as payment therefore must be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &amp;#8220;Securities Act&amp;#8221;). The Preferred&#13;Stock shall terminate on April 15, 2020.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;Prior&#13;to the Merger, Morinda was an S corporation for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Accordingly, Morinda&amp;#8217;s taxable&#13;earnings were reported on the individual income tax returns of the stockholders who were responsible for payment of the related&#13;income tax liabilities.&amp;#160;In December 2018, Morinda agreed to distribute to its stockholders approximately $39.6 million of&#13;its previously-taxed S corporation earnings whereby distributions are payable (i)&amp;#160;up to $25.0 million for which the timing&#13;and amount are subject to a future financing event, and (ii)&amp;#160;approximately $14.6 million based on the calculation of&amp;#160;excess&#13;working capital (&amp;#8220;EWC&amp;#8221;)&amp;#160;as of the Closing Date. EWC is the amount by which Morinda&amp;#8217;s actual working capital&#13;(as defined in the Merger Agreement) on the Closing Date exceeds $25.0 million.&amp;#160;The Closing Date balance sheet of Morinda&#13;indicated that EWC was approximately $14.6 million as of the Closing Date.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;Revenue&#13;    for the Marley reporting unit is not expected to exceed the $15.0 million earnout threshold during 2019. The fair value of&#13;    the earnout was valued using the weighted average return on assets whereby the fair value increased from $0.8 million to $0.9&#13;    million during 2018. The increase in the fair value of the earnout of $0.1 million is recognized as an expense for the year&#13;    ended December 31, 2018.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#13;&lt;/table&gt;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;On&#13;January 10, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated third party resulting in the sale for $8.9 million&#13;of the land and building that serves as the Company&amp;#8217;s corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado. Concurrently with the&#13;sale, the Company entered into a lease of this property for an initial term of ten years, with two options to extend for successive&#13;five-year periods. The monthly lease cost is $52,000 for the initial year, with 2% annual increases for each year thereafter.&#13;The Company determined that this transaction qualified as a sale under ASU 2016-02 (&amp;#8220;&lt;i&gt;Leases&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#8221;), which the Company&#13;adopted effective January 1, 2017. Therefore, a gain of approximately $3.3 million was recognized for the year ended December&#13;31, 2017. In connection with the leaseback, the Company recognized an ROU lease asset and a corresponding ROU lease liability&#13;for approximately $4.3 million. The present value of the ROU lease liability was based on the Company&amp;#8217;s implicit borrowing&#13;rate of 10.0% on the closing date.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;On&#13;August 10, 2018 (the &amp;#8220;Closing Date&amp;#8221;), the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with Siena Lending Group&#13;LLC (&amp;#8220;Siena&amp;#8221;) that provides for a $12.0 million revolving credit facility (the &amp;#8220;Siena Revolver&amp;#8221;) with&#13;a scheduled maturity date of August 10, 2021 (the &amp;#8220;Maturity Date&amp;#8221;). Outstanding borrowings bear interest at the greater&#13;of (i) 7.5% or (ii) the prime rate plus 2.75%. As of December 31, 2018, the effective interest rate was 8.25%. Beginning on November&#13;7, 2018, the Company was required to pay interest on a minimum of $2.0 million of borrowings, regardless of whether such funds&#13;had been borrowed. The Siena Revolver also provides for an unused line fee equal to 0.5% per annum of the undrawn portion of the&#13;$12.0 million commitment. The Siena Revolver is subject to availability based on eligible accounts receivables and eligible inventory&#13;of the Company. As of December&amp;#160;31, 2018, the borrowing base calculation permitted total borrowings of approximately $2.5&#13;million. After deducting the outstanding principal balance of $2.0 million, the Company had excess borrowing availability of $0.5&#13;million. Pursuant to the Siena Revolver, the Company granted a security interest in substantially all assets and intellectual&#13;property of the Company and its subsidiaries, except for such assets owned by Morinda. Siena&amp;#8217;s obligation to fund loans&#13;was subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including the requirement to raise debt or equity which was satisfied&#13;during the fourth quarter of 2018.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;The&#13;Siena Revolver contains standard and customary events of default including, but not limited to, maintaining compliance with the&#13;financial and non-financial covenants set forth in the Siena Revolver. The financial covenants require maintenance of a fixed&#13;charge coverage ratio of no less than 1.1 if excess borrowing availability is less than $1.0 million, and to maintain minimum&#13;liquidity of $2.0 million. The fixed charge coverage ratio compares EBITDA, net of unfinanced capital expenditures, to fixed charges&#13;for the latest quarterly reporting period. As of December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants.&#13;The Siena Revolver also limits or prohibits the Company from paying dividends, incurring additional debt, selling significant&#13;assets, or merging with other entities without the consent of the lenders. The Siena Revolver also includes an event of default&#13;if Brent Willis ceases to be employed as chief executive officer or if Greg Gould ceases to be employed as the chief financial&#13;officer, unless a successor is appointed within 60 days and such successor is reasonably satisfactory to the Lender.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;In&#13;connection with the financing, the Company incurred a financial advisor fee, a closing fee and professional fees for a total of&#13;$0.4 million. This amount is being accounted for as debt issuance costs that is being amortized using the straight-line method&#13;over the three-year term of the Siena Revolver.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;The&#13;Siena Revolver includes a lockbox arrangement that requires the Company to direct its customers to remit payments to a restricted&#13;bank account, whereby all available funds are used to pay down the outstanding principal balance under the Siena Revolver. Accordingly,&#13;the entire outstanding principal balance of the Siena Revolver is classified as a current liability as of December 31, 2018. [As&#13;discussed in Note 16, the Siena Revolver was paid off and terminated on March 29, 2019.]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;The&#13;Siena Revolver includes features that were determined to be embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation and accounting as separate&#13;financial instruments. The Company determined that embedded derivatives include the requirement to pay (i) an early termination&#13;premium if the Siena Revolver is terminated before the Maturity Date, and (ii) default interest at a 5.0% premium if events of&#13;default exist. An early termination premium is required to be paid if Siena&amp;#8217;s commitment to make revolving loans is terminated&#13;prior to the Maturity Date. The fee is equal to 4.00%, 2.25% and 1.25% of the $12.0 million commitment if termination occurs during&#13;the first, second and third years after the Closing Date, respectively. These embedded derivatives are classified within Level&#13;3 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair value was estimated using the &amp;#8220;with&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;without&amp;#8221; method. Accordingly,&#13;the Siena Revolver was first valued with the embedded derivatives (the &amp;#8220;with&amp;#8221; scenario) and subsequently valued without&#13;the embedded derivatives (the &amp;#8220;without&amp;#8221; scenario). The fair value of the embedded derivatives was estimated as the&#13;difference between these two scenarios.&amp;#160;The fair values were determined using the income approach, specifically the yield&#13;method. As of December 31, 2018, key Level 3 assumptions and estimates used in the valuation of the embedded derivatives included&#13;an assessment of the probability of early termination of the Siena Revolver, the remaining term to maturity of approximately 2.6&#13;years, probability of default of approximately 10%, and a discount rate of 6.1%.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

The Company recognized a loss on change in fair value of embedded&#13;derivatives of $0.5 million which is included in non-operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;On&#13;August 3, 2016, the Company&amp;#8217;s approved and implemented the New Age Beverages Corporation 2016-2017 Long Term Incentive Plan&#13;(the &amp;#8220;LTI Plan&amp;#8221;). The LTI Plan provides for stock options to be granted to employees, directors and consultants at&#13;an exercise price not less than 100% of the fair value of the Company&amp;#8217;s Common Stock on the grant date. The options granted&#13;generally have a maximum term of 10 years from the grant date and are exercisable upon vesting. Option grants generally vest over&#13;a period between one and three years after the grant date of such award. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 0.2 million shares&#13;were available for future grants of stock options, restricted stock and similar instruments under the LTI Plan. The number of&#13;shares reserved for grants is adjusted annually on the first day of January whereby a maximum of 10% of the Company&amp;#8217;s outstanding&#13;shares of Common Stock are available for grant under the LTI Plan. Accordingly, as of January 1, 2019, an additional 4.0 million&#13;shares of Common Stock became available for future grants under the LTI Plan.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;Based&#13;on the assumptions set forth above, the weighted-average grant date fair value per share of employee options during the years&#13;ended December&amp;#160;31, 2018 and 2017 was $4.05 and $1.11, respectively. The BSM model requires various highly subjective assumptions&#13;that represent management&amp;#8217;s best estimates of the fair value of the Company&amp;#8217;s Common Stock, volatility, risk-free&#13;interest rates, expected term, and dividend yield. The expected term represents the weighted-average period that options granted&#13;are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules. Since the Company does not have an extended history&#13;of actual exercises, the Company has estimated the expected term using a simplified method which calculates the expected term&#13;as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the awards. The Company has never declared or paid cash dividends&#13;and does not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future; therefore, the Company used an expected dividend yield of zero.&#13;The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury rates in effect during the expected term of the grant. The expected volatility&#13;is based on the historical volatility of the Company&amp;#8217;s Common Stock for the period beginning in August 2016 when its shares&#13;were first publicly traded through the grant date of the respective stock options.&amp;#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;Morinda&#13;has a defined contribution employee benefit plan under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the &amp;#8220;401(k) Plan&amp;#8221;).&#13;The 401(k) Plan covers all eligible U.S. employees of Morinda who are entitled to participate at the beginning of the first full&#13;quarter following commencement of employment. Morinda matches contributions up to 3% of the participating employee&amp;#8217;s compensation.&#13;Morinda&amp;#8217;s matching contributions vest over four years with 0% vested through the end of the first year of service and 33%&#13;vesting upon completion of each of the next three years of service. Total contributions by Morinda to the 401(k) Plan were insignificant&#13;for the period from December 21, 2018 through December 31, 2018. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company extended the right to&#13;participate in the 401(k) Plan to all of the Company&amp;#8217;s eligible employees.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;Morinda&#13;has an unfunded retirement benefit plan for the Company&amp;#8217;s Japanese branch that entitles substantially all employees in Japan,&#13;other than directors, to retirement payments.

 Serif&gt;Upon&#13;termination of employment, the Morinda employees of the Japanese branch are generally entitled to retirement benefits determined&#13;by reference to basic rates of pay at the time of termination, years of service, and conditions under which the termination occurs.&#13;If the termination is involuntary or caused by retirement at the mandatory retirement age of 65, the employee is entitled to a&#13;greater payment than in the case of voluntary termination. Morinda employees in Indonesia whose service is terminated are generally&#13;entitled to retirement benefits determined by reference to basic rates of pay at the time of termination, years of service and&#13;conditions under which the termination occurs. The unfunded benefit obligation for these defined benefit pension plans was approximately&#13;$3.0 million as of December&amp;#160;31, 2018. Of this amount, approximately $2.9 million is included in other long-term liabilities&#13;in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;The&#13;Company&amp;#8217;s operations are subject to numerous governmental rules and regulations in each of the countries it does business.&#13;These rules and regulations include a complex array of tax and customs regulations as well as restrictions on product ingredients&#13;and claims, the commissions paid to the Company&amp;#8217;s IPCs, labeling and packaging of products, conducting business as a direct-selling&#13;business, and other facets of manufacturing and selling products. In some instances, the rules and regulations may not be fully&#13;defined under the law or are otherwise unclear in their application. Additionally, laws and regulations can change from time to&#13;time, as can their interpretation by the courts, administrative bodies, and the tax and customs authorities in each country. The&#13;Company actively seeks to be in compliance, in all material respects, with the laws of each of the countries in which it does&#13;business and expects its IPCs to do the same. The Company&amp;#8217;s operations are often subject to review by local country tax&#13;and customs authorities and inquiries from other governmental agencies. No assurance can be given that the Company&amp;#8217;s compliance&#13;with governmental rules and regulations will not be challenged by the authorities or that such challenges will not result in assessments&#13;or required changes in the Company&amp;#8217;s business that could have a material impact on its business, consolidated financial&#13;statements and cash flow.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;From&#13;time to time, the Company may be a party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Although&#13;the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes that the final outcome&#13;of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation&#13;can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other&#13;factors.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;Net&#13;loss per share is computed by dividing loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares&#13;outstanding during the year. The calculation of diluted net loss per share includes dilutive stock options, unvested restricted&#13;stock awards, and other Common Stock equivalents computed using the treasury stock method, in order to compute the weighted average&#13;number of shares outstanding. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, basic and diluted net loss per share were the same&#13;since all Common Stock equivalents were anti-dilutive. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the following potential Common Stock&#13;equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share since the impact of inclusion was anti-dilutive (in&#13;thousands):&amp;#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;Fair&#13;value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction&#13;between market participants on the measurement date. When determining fair value, the Company considers the principal or most&#13;advantageous market in which it transacts and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset&#13;or liability. The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value&#13;into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant&#13;to the fair measurement:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;For&#13;the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, one customer comprised approximately 11% and 10%, respectively, of the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;consolidated net revenue. A substantial portion of the business acquired from Morinda is conducted in foreign markets, exposing&#13;the Company to the risks of trade or foreign exchange restrictions, increased tariffs, foreign currency fluctuations and similar&#13;risks associated with foreign operations. Approximately 70% of the Company&amp;#8217;s consolidated net revenue and 90% of Morinda&amp;#8217;s&#13;net revenue for 2019 is expected to be generated outside the United States, primarily in the Asia Pacific market. Morinda&amp;#8217;s&#13;Tahitian Noni&amp;#174; Juice, MAX and other noni-based beverage products are expected to comprise over 85% of Morinda&amp;#8217;s net&#13;revenue for 2019. However, if consumer demand for these products decreases significantly or if the Company ceases to offer these&#13;products without a suitable replacement, the Company&amp;#8217;s consolidated financial condition and operating results would be adversely&#13;affected. The Company purchases fruit and other Noni-based raw materials from French Polynesia, but these purchases of materials&#13;are from a wide variety of individual suppliers with no single supplier accounting for more than 10% of its raw material purchases&#13;during 2018. However, as the majority of the raw materials are consolidated and processed at the Company&amp;#8217;s plant in Tahiti,&#13;the Company could be negatively affected by certain governmental actions or natural disasters if they occurred in that region&#13;of the world.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;Financial&#13;instruments that subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted&#13;cash, and accounts receivable.

 Serif&gt;Generally,&#13;credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is diversified due to the number of entities comprising the Company&amp;#8217;s customer&#13;base and their dispersion across different geographies and industries.

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;Goodwill represents the excess of the&#13;purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill and other&#13;intangibles with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but tested for impairment annually or more frequently when events or&#13;circumstances indicates that the carrying value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its fair value. The goodwill impairment&#13;test is applied by performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit. If, on the basis&#13;of qualitative factors, it is considered more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying&#13;amount, further testing of goodwill for impairment is not required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting&#13;unit&amp;#8217;s fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill&#13;allocated to that reporting unit. The Company performed a qualitative assessment and determined there was no impairment of goodwill&#13;for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt/normal Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0&gt;The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and&#13;liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial&#13;reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in&#13;effect when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon&#13;future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred&#13;income tax asset will not be realized based on the weight of available evidence, including expected future earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt/normal Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;In&#13;May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.&amp;#160;2014-09, &lt;i&gt;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&lt;/i&gt;, which supersedes nearly&#13;all existing revenue recognition standards under U.S. GAAP. The new standard provides a five-step process for recognizing&#13;revenue that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to&#13;which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted this ASU using the&#13;full retrospective method effective January 1, 2018. The impact of adoption of this ASU was immaterial and, accordingly,&#13;there were no changes to the previously issued financial statements for the year ended Decemebr 31, 2017.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;In&#13;August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&amp;#8220;ASU&amp;#8221;)&#13;No. 2016-15, &lt;i&gt;Statement of Cash Flows, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.&amp;#160;&lt;/i&gt;The new standard&#13;is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are classified in the statements of&#13;cash flows and must be adopted retrospectively for each prior reporting period presented upon initial adoption. ASU 2016-15 was&#13;adopted effective January 1, 2018 and did not have a material impact on the Company&amp;#8217;s consolidated financial statements&#13;for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Accordingly, there were no transactions that required retrospective adjustments&#13;in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2017.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;In&#13;November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18,&amp;#160;&lt;i&gt;Statement of Cash&amp;#160;Flows &amp;#8211; Restricted Cash&lt;/i&gt;, which requires&#13;entities that have restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents to reconcile the change during the period in the total cash,&#13;cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents in its statement of cash flows.&#13;As a result, amounts generally described as cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents&#13;shown on the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted this standard during 2018 using the retrospective transition method.&#13;The adoption did not result in any changes to the Company&amp;#8217;s previously reported consolidated statements of cash flows for&#13;the year ended December 31, 2017.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;In&#13;May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09,&amp;#160;&lt;i&gt;Compensation&amp;#8212;Stock Compensation: Scope of Modification Accounting&lt;/i&gt;,&#13;which provides clarification on when modification accounting should be used for changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based&#13;payment award. This standard does not change the accounting for modifications of share-based payment awards but clarifies that&#13;modification accounting guidance should only be applied if there is a change to the value, vesting conditions, or award classification&#13;and would not be required if the changes are considered non-substantive. This standard was adopted by the Company in the first&#13;quarter of fiscal 2018 and did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.&amp;#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;In&#13;June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, &lt;i&gt;Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on&#13;Financial Instruments.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#160; ASU 2016-13 amends the guidance on the impairment of financial instruments. &amp;#160;This update&#13;adds an impairment model (known as the current expected credit losses model) that is based on expected losses rather than incurred&#13;losses. &amp;#160;Under the new guidance, an entity recognizes, as an allowance, its estimate of expected credit losses. &amp;#160;In&#13;November 2018, ASU 2016-13 was amended by ASU 2018-19, &lt;i&gt;Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments&#13;&amp;#8211; Credit Losses.&lt;/i&gt; &amp;#160;ASU 2018-19 changes the effective date of the credit loss standards (ASU 2016-13) to fiscal&#13;years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Further, the ASU clarifies that&#13;operating lease receivables are not within the scope of ASC 326-20 and should instead be accounted for under the new leasing standard,&#13;ASC 842.&amp;#160; &amp;#160;The Company has not yet determined the effect that ASU 2018-19 will have on its results operations, balance&#13;sheets or financial statement disclosures.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;In&#13;January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, &lt;i&gt;Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill&#13;Impairment.&lt;/i&gt; The amendments in this ASU simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill&#13;impairment test and eliminating the requirement for a reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative&#13;assessment. Instead, under this ASU, an entity would perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the&#13;fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying&#13;amount exceeds the reporting unit&amp;#8217;s fair value; however, the loss recognized is not to exceed the total amount of goodwill&#13;allocated to that reporting unit. In addition, income tax effects will be considered, if applicable. This ASU is effective for&#13;fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The&#13;Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;In&#13;December 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (&amp;#8220;Tax Act&amp;#8221;) was enacted into law which significantly revises&#13;the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The newly enacted federal income tax law, among other things, contains significant&#13;changes to corporate taxation, including a flat corporate tax rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense&#13;to 30% of adjusted taxable income, limitation of the deduction for newly generated net operating losses to 80% of current year&#13;taxable income and elimination of net operating loss (&amp;#8220;NOL&amp;#8221;) carrybacks, future taxation of certain classes of offshore&#13;earnings regardless of whether they are repatriated, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for&#13;depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits beginning in 2018.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;As&#13;of December&amp;#160;31, 2018, the Company has continued its position to return all foreign earnings to the U.S. parent company and&#13;has recorded deferred tax liabilities of $850,000 for foreign withholding taxes associated with foreign retained earnings and&#13;cross-border payments.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;As&#13;a result of the Tax Act, the corporate tax rate decreased from a top marginal rate of 35% that was effective through December&#13;31, 2017 to a flat rate of 21% effective January 1, 2018. Accordingly, a decrease of $1.4 million in the Company&amp;#8217;s domestic&#13;deferred income tax assets was recognized as of December 31, 2017, and this amount was fully offset by a corresponding decrease&#13;in the valuation allowance.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;Before&#13;the Company acquired Morinda on December 21, 2018, Morinda&amp;#8217;s net earnings taxed for the U.S. and various state jurisdictions&#13;were payable personally by the shareholders pursuant to an election under Subchapter&amp;#160;S of the Internal Revenue Code. The&#13;Subchapter S election terminated upon closing of the business combination with the Company. Accordingly, the Company recognized&#13;net deferred income tax liabilities of approximately $9.9 million for differences between the income tax basis of the assets and&#13;liabilities and the related balances for financial reporting purposes.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

The Company has recorded income tax liabilities for&#13;foreign withholding on distributed earnings. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has no undistributed earnings from foreign&#13;subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested. The Company is also responsible for state income taxes and other taxes&#13;assessed at the Company level.

 Serif; margin: 0&gt;For the year ended December&amp;#160;31, 2017 the valuation allowance&#13;increased by $0.7 million, primarily as a result of the increase in net operating losses. For the year ended December&amp;#160;31,&#13;2018, the net decrease in the valuation allowance amounted to $2.9 million since net operating loss carryforwards were considered&#13;to be realizable due to net deferred tax liabilities related to purchase accounting. In assessing the realizability of deferred&#13;income tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax&#13;assets will not be realized.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;At&#13;December 31, 2018, the Company has federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $36.3 million, of which $24.9 million does not expire&#13;and $11.4 million will begin to expire in 2023. Additionally, the Company has varying amounts of NOL carryforwards in the U.S.&#13;states in which it does business that start to expire in 2023. Federal and state laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization&#13;of NOL and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for income tax purposes, as defined in Section&amp;#160;382&#13;of the Internal Revenue Code.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;Pursuant&#13;to Internal Revenue Code (&amp;#8220;IRC&amp;#8221;) Section 382, annual use of the Company&amp;#8217;s net operating loss carryforwards may&#13;be limited in the event a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% occurs within a three-year period. The Company has not&#13;completed an IRC Section 382 analysis regarding the limitation of net operating loss carryforwards.

 Serif&gt;As&#13;discussed above, the imposition of the one-time Transition Tax may reduce or eliminate U.S. federal deferred income taxes on the&#13;unremitted earnings of the Company&amp;#8217;s foreign subsidiaries. However, the Company may still be liable for withholding taxes&#13;or other income taxes that might be incurred upon the repatriation of foreign earnings. The Company has made a provision for additional&#13;income taxes on undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because the Company does not intend to permanently reinvest&#13;these earnings outside the United States.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

As a result of the business combination with Morinda in December 2018 as discussed in&#13;Note 3, the Company has changed its operating segments to consist of the Morinda segment and the New Age segment. The New Age&#13;segment was previously comprised of the Brands segment and the DSD segment which are now combined as a single segment as they&#13;are operating with a single management team. After the Morinda business combination, the Company&amp;#8217;s CODM began&#13;assessing performance and allocating resources based on the financial information of these two reporting segments.&#13;Accordingly, the Company&amp;#8217;s previous segment disclosures have been restated for the year ended December 31, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0&gt;The Company determines if contractual arrangements are considered&#13;a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (&amp;#8220;ROU&amp;#8221;) assets, whereas assets&#13;related to finance leases are included in property and equipment. The corresponding liabilities related to ROU assets and assets&#13;under financing leases are included in accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the Company&amp;#8217;s consolidated&#13;balance sheets, based on the related contractual maturities. ROU assets represent the Company&amp;#8217;s right to use an underlying&#13;asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the related obligations to make lease payments arising from the lease.&#13;Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments&#13;over the lease term. None of the Company&amp;#8217;s leases provide an implicit interest rate, which requires use of the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;estimated incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes&#13;any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 8pt/normal Times New Roman
