: Revenue from products relate to shipments of cannabidiol (&#8220;CBD&#8221;) brand products
 which we began selling in late February 2017. During our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018
 we earned revenue from our CBD product lines of $197
554 as compared to $18
054 for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2017. The increase of 994% reflects a full year of sales incurred from our CBD brand products as compared to one month in fiscal 2017. In addition
 during our fiscal year ended March 31
 2017
 we received $27
500 from a license agreement which did not recur nor did we receive any other revenue from licenses during our fiscal year ended March 31
: Cost of goods sold consists of purchases of inventory for sale. We generally purchase products that are private labels and brand the products using our tradenames. During the fiscal year ended March 31
 2018
 we incurred $155
549 of costs to purchase product which represented 80% of our product revenues. Since we began sales of CBD products in late February 2017
 cost of products for fiscal year ended March 31
: For our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018
 gross margin comprised entirely from sale of our CBD products and was $42
005 or 21% of our revenue. For our fiscal year ended March 31
 2017
 gross margin was $39
163 which comprised $27
500 from sale of services and $11
: Sales and marketing expenses mainly comprised of advertising
 public relations
 events
 and website marketing costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased to $356
948 for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018 as compared to $16
899 for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2017. The majority of the increase related to public relation services
: General and administrative expenses mainly comprised of professional fees
 travel expenses
 meals and entertainment and other office support costs. General and administrative expenses increased $811
622 to $953
484 for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018 as compared to $141
862 for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2017. General and administrative expenses during our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018 included non-cash stock based compensation related to our issuance of stock for services to board advisory members and our CEO
 which totaled approximately $598
: In conjunction with the Share Exchange Agreement
 Stony Hill Ventures paid us $325
000 and we assumed $51
366 of liabilities
: Depreciation and amortization relates to depreciation of our property and equipment and the amortization of a brand that we acquired in February 2017
 which was being amortized over a period of 5 years. Amortization totaled $224
770 for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018 as compared to $19
956 for our fiscal year ended March 31
: During our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018
 sales of the VitaCBD products did not meet our expectations. As such
 we were not able to achieve the expected operating results from the VitaCBD brand products. As a result
 we impaired the intangible asset related to the acquisition of the&nbsp;VitaCBD brand name&nbsp;and recorded an impairment charge of $893
667 which reflected the net book value of the intangible as of March 31
A summary of our cash flows for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018 as compared to our fiscal year ended March 31
Net cash used in operating activities was $637
467 for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018 as compared to $137
464 for our fiscal year ended March 31
Net cash used in investing activities was $173
236 for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018 as compared to $775
000 for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2017. The decrease primarily related to lower investments in equity and an intangible purchased during our fiscal year ended March 31
 2017
 which we did not purchase a similar asset during our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018. In addition
 investing activities during our fiscal year ended March 31
 2017 included reverse merger costs paid in cash of $325
000 for which we did not incur a similar cost in our fiscal year ended March 31
Net cash provided by financing activities was $695
000 for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018 as compared to $1
125
101 for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2017. The decrease primarily relates to less sales of our shares of our common stock offset slightly by a higher price per share obtained from our sale of common stock during our fiscal year 2018. In addition
 during our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018
 we paid $100
000 to repurchase 5
400
Our uses of cash have been primarily for strategic investments we made and operations and marketing efforts to promote our products and company. Our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by financing
 primarily through the sale of equity securities
 as we have only recently begun to receive revenues from our principal business activities and we have used cash for various strategic investments for which we typically receive returns when such investments are sold and when or if dividends are declared. We anticipate that significant additional expenditures will be necessary to expand and bring to market our products and investments before sufficient and consistent positive operating cash flows will be achieved. As such
 we anticipate that additional funds will be needed to continue operations
 obtain profitability and to achieve our objectives. As of the date of this Form 10-K
As reflected in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere is this Form 10-K
 as of March 31
 2018 we had cash on hand and had an accumulated deficit of $60
934 and $2
901
933 respectively
 and during our fiscal year ended March 31
 2018
 we utilized cash for operations and incurred a net loss of $673
467 and $2
386
864
 respectively. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Further
 our independent auditors in their audit report for our fiscal year ended March 31
Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital and to ultimately achieve sustainable revenues and income from our operations. During the fiscal year ended March 31
 2018
 we raised $795
000 through the receipt of Subscription Agreements (&#8220;Subscription&#8221;) where we sold 397
500 shares of our common stock to accredited investors at a price of $2.00 per share. As of March 31
 2018
 we had cash on hand of $60
934. We estimate that such funds will not be sufficient to continue operations without obtaining additional funds. As such
 we are currently working on obtaining additional funds to operate our business through and beyond the date of this Form 10-K filing. However
 there can be no assurance that such funds will be available or at terms acceptable to us. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing
 it may contain undue restrictions and covenants on our operations
Financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Among other things
 estimates include the collectability of accounts receivable
 recoverability of inventory
 assumptions made in determining impairment of investments and intangible
 useful life of our intangible
 and accruals for potential liabilities. These estimates generally involve complex issues and require judgments
 involve analysis of historical information and the prediction of future trends
For investments that are not required to be consolidated
 we use either the equity method or the cost method of accounting. We use the equity method for unconsolidated equity investments in which we are considered to have significant influence over the operations of the investee. We use the cost method for all other investments. Under the cost method
 there is no change to the cost basis unless there is an other-than-temporary decline in value or dividends are received. If the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary
Intangible assets are recorded when such assets are acquired and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset. We regularly review intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful lives have changed from the original estimate or that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist
 we assess the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments

Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended March 31

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Applied Biosciences Corp. (Formerly Stony Hill Corp.) (the Company) as of March 31
 2018 and 2017
 the related consolidated statements of operations
 stockholders' equity
 and cash flows for the years then ended
 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated&nbsp;financial statements). In our opinion
 the consolidated financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of March 31
 2018 and 2017
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the fiscal years then ended
The accompanying consolidated&nbsp;financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated&nbsp;financial statements
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management

Applied BioSciences Corp. (formerly First Fixtures
 Inc. and Stony Hill Corp. or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 21
 2014 and established a fiscal year end of March 31. Effective October 24
 2016 the Company changed its name from First Fixtures Inc. to Stony Hill Corp and on March 6
 2018
 the Company changed its name from Stony Hill Corp. to Applied BioSciences Corp. The Company is focused on multiple areas of the hemp and CBD industry. Specifically
 the Company is focused on select investments

 real estate
 and partnership opportunities in the recreational

 nutraceutical
On November 4
 2016
 the Company
 entered into a Share Exchange Agreement by and among the Company
 Stony Hill Ventures Corp. (&#8220;Stony Hill Ventures&#8221;)
 and the holders of common stock of Stony Hill Ventures
 which consisted of 26 stockholders. Stony Hill Ventures was incorporated on March 15
 2016
Under the terms and conditions of the Share Exchange Agreement
 the Company offered
 sold and issued 10
830
The merger between the Company and Stony Hill Ventures was treated as a reverse acquisition for financial statement reporting purposes with Stony Hill Ventures deemed the accounting acquirer and the Company deemed the accounting acquiree. Accordingly
 Stony Hill Ventures&#8217; assets
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. As reflected in the consolidated financial statements
 as of March 31
 2018 the Company has incurred a net loss of $2
386
864 and used $673
467 of cash from operating activities during the fiscal year ended March 31
The Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital and to ultimately achieve sustainable revenues and income from operations. During the fiscal year ended March 31
 2018
 the Company raised $795
000 through the sale of 497
500 aggregate shares of its common stock to accredited investors. As of March 31
 2018
 cash on hand was $60
934 and management estimates that the current funds on hand will not be sufficient to continue operations without obtaining additional funds. As such
 the Company is currently working on obtaining additional funds to operate its business through and beyond the date of this Form 10-K filing. However
 there is no assurance that such funds will be available or at terms acceptable to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing
 it may contain undue restrictions and covenants on its operations
MARCH 31
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries
 Stony Hill Ventures Corp.
 a Nevada corporation
 Applied Products LLC
 a Washington limited liability&nbsp;company
 and&nbsp;SH Holdings LLC and SH Products LLC
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Among other things
 management estimates include the collectability of its accounts receivable
 recoverability of inventory
 assumptions made in determining impairment of investments and intangible assets
 accruals for potential liabilities
 and realization of deferred tax assets. These estimates generally involve complex issues and require judgments
 involve analysis of historical information and the prediction of future trends
The Company follows paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;Paragraph 820-10-35-37&#8221;) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP)
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures
Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1
Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above
The carrying amounts of the Company&#8217;s financial assets and liabilities
MARCH 31
The Company receives revenue from two main sources - license fees and sale of products. For license fees
 revenue arrangements provide for the payment of contractually determined monthly ongoing fees in consideration for the grant of right to use intellectual property of the Company
 including trademark
 trade dress
 images
For both license fees and sale of products
 revenue is recognized when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 (ii) all obligations have been substantially performed pursuant to the terms of the arrangement
 (iii) amounts are fixed or determinable
The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense for the fiscal periods ended March 31
 2018 and 2017 amounted to $193
977 and $15
414
 respectively
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined principally on a first-in-first-out average cost basis. Inventories consist of finished goods held for sale. Management regularly reviews inventory quantities on-hand and records an inventory provision for excess or obsolete inventory based on the future expected demand for our products. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market value
 based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently difficult to assess. There was no provision for inventory obsolescence necessary as of March 31
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company uses an estimated useful life of three years for employee-related computers and software
 three years for other office equipment and computer hardware
Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Based upon management&#8217;s annual assessment
 there were no indicators of impairment of the Company&#8217;s property and equipment and other long-lived assets as of March 31
Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
 net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Company&#8217;s assessment of the collectability of accounts. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts by considering the age of each outstanding invoice and the collection history of each customer to determine whether a specific allowance is appropriate. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when identified. As of March 31
 2018 and 2017
 the allowance for doubtful accounts was $2
227 and nil
MARCH 31
For investments that are not required to be consolidated
 the Company uses either the equity method or the cost method of accounting. The Company uses the equity method for unconsolidated equity investments in which the Company is considered to have significant influence over the operations of the investee. The Company uses the cost method for all other investments. Under the cost method
 there is no change to the cost basis unless there is an other-than-temporary decline in value or dividends are received. If the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary
Intangible assets are recorded when such assets are acquired and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset. The Company regularly reviews intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful lives have changed from the original estimate or that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist
 the Company assesses the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments
 if any
On February 23
 2017
 the Company consummated an Asset Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with mCig
 Inc. for the purchase of the VitaCBD brand name. In connection with the Agreement
 the Company recorded intangible assets of $1
138
135. As of March 31
 2017
 the Company did&nbsp;not believe there were any indicators of impairment of its intangible asset given the recent acquisition. During the fiscal year ended March 31
 2018
 sales of the VitaCBD products did not meet management&#8217;s expectations and the Company was not able to achieve the expected operating results. As a result
 the Company impaired the intangible asset related to the acquisition of the&nbsp;VitaCBD brand name&nbsp;and recorded an impairment charge of $893
667
 representing the net book value of intangibles at March 31
 2018
 after current year amortization of $224
The Company accounts for employee and non-employee stock awards under ASC 718
 Compensation-Stock Compensation
 whereby equity instruments issued to employees for services are recorded based on the fair value of the instrument issued at the grant date and recognized over the requisite service period. The Company has not adopted a stock option plan as of March 31
The Company accounts for stock-based payments to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50
 Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. Stock-based payments to non-employees include grants of stock
MARCH 31
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method
The Company operates in one segment for the distribution of products. In accordance with the &#8220;Segment Reporting&#8221; Topic of the ASC
 the Company&#8217;s chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer and President
 who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Existing guidance
 which is based on a management approach to segment reporting
 establishes requirements to report selected segment information quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services
 major customers
 and the countries in which the entity holds material assets and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation under &#8220;Segment Reporting&#8221; due to their similar customer base and similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of products and services; and procurement
 manufacturing and distribution processes. Since the Company operates in one segment
In May 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. Under ASU 2014-09
 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition
 the standard requires disclosure of the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The FASB has recently issued ASU 2016-08
 ASU 2016-10
 ASU 2016-11
 ASU 2016-12
 ASU 2016-20
 and ASU 2017-05
 all of which clarify certain implementation guidance within ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods therein. The standard can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method)
 or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). The Company will adopt the provisions of this statement in the quarter beginning April 1
In February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases. This update will require the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability
 initially measured at the present value of the lease payments
 for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. For operating leases
 the asset and liability will be expensed over the lease term on a straight-line basis
 with all cash flows included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. For finance leases
 interest on the lease liability will be recognized separately from the amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statement of comprehensive income and the repayment of the principal portion of the lease liability will be classified as a financing activity while the interest component will be included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption
MARCH 31
In January 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-01
 Financial Instruments &#8211; Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. ASU 2016-01 primarily affects equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
 and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Among other things
 this new guidance requires certain equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. This standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 with certain provisions allowing for early adoption. The Company will adopt the provisions of this statement in the quarter beginning April 1

The Company adopted accounting rules which address the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under these rules
 the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. These accounting rules also provide guidance on de-recognition

In April 2018
 the Company sold 12
500 shares of common stock at a price of $2.00 per share for total proceeds of $25
000. The shares were issued pursuant to a private placement Subscription Agreement with accredited investors. The Subscription Agreement offered up to one million shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock at a price per share of $2.00 per share. The Company made this offering solely to accredited investors
 as defined under Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933
As of the end of the fiscal year ended March 31
 2018
 we carried out an evaluation
 under the supervision and with the participation of members of our management
 including our President (who is our principal executive officer) and our Secretary (who is our principal financial officer)
 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act. Our President and our Secretary have concluded
 based on their evaluation
 that as of March 31
 2018
 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized
 and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including the President and Secretary
 as appropriate
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process
 including policies and procedures
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of this assessment
 our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of March 31
 2018 based on such criteria. Deficiencies existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (i) lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board
 resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and (ii) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. Management believes that the lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures
A control system
 no matter how well conceived and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance that the objectives of the control system are met under all potential conditions
 regardless of how remote
 and may not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
In connection with our continued monitoring and maintenance of our controls procedures as part of the implementation of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 we continue to review
 test
 and improve the effectiveness of our internal controls. There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter and since the year ended March 31
 2018 that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect

ITEM 10. DIRECTORS
Our executive officer&#8217;s and director&#8217;s and their respective age&#8217;s as of March 31
Secretary
Chris Bridges
Chris Bridges has served as our President since February 10
 2017
 and as a director since March 9
 2017. Chris Bridges
 age 38
 has served as the Chief Executive Officer of Vessix Inx
 a virtual payment systems business which provides payment services designed for the aviation industry
 since January 2013. From January 2009 until September 2013
 Mr. Bridges served as a director of Banctek Solutions
 which provides merchant bankcard processing services to all types of merchants. From January 2005 until January 2008
 Mr. Bridges was Executive Vice President - Acquisitions at PRS Assets
 of Denver
John Brady
John Brady has served as the Secretary of the Company since October 3
 2016
 and as our Treasurer since January 5
 2018. Mr. Brady spent the first part of his career as a broker and owner of a boutique investment banking brokerage firm. For the past 12 years
 he been an independent consultant
Our board of directors is currently composed of two members
 neither of whom qualify as an independent director in accordance with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market. The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests
 such as that the director is not
 and has not been for at least three years
 one of our employees and that neither the director
 nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. In addition
 our board of directors has not made a subjective determination as to each director that no relationships exist which
 in the opinion of our board of directors
 would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director
 though such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our board of directors made these determinations
No director
 nominee for director
As of March 31
 2018
 the Company has no significant employees
Since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors
 the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our directors. The Board of Directors has not established an audit committee and does not have an audit committee financial expert
 nor has the Board of Directors established a nominating committee. The Board is of the opinion that such committees are not necessary since the Company is an early business development stage company and has only two directors
 and to date
 such directors have been performing the functions of such committees. Thus
 there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation
 nominations
There are no family relationships among our directors or officers. Other than as described above
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our executive officers and directors
 and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities
 file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Executive officers
 directors and greater-than-ten percent stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based on our review of filings made on the SEC website
 and the fact of us not receiving certain forms or written representations from certain reporting persons that they have complied with the relevant filing requirements
 we believe that
 during the year ended March 31
 2018
 none of our executive officers
We have not implemented a formal policy or procedure by which our stockholders can communicate directly with our Board of Directors. Nevertheless
 every effort has been made to ensure that the views of stockholders are heard by the Board of Directors or individual directors
 as applicable
 and that appropriate responses are provided to stockholders in a timely manner. We believe that we are responsive to stockholder communications
 and therefore have not considered it necessary to adopt a formal process for stockholder communications with our Board. During the upcoming year
The Company has not adopted a code of ethics that applies to its principal executive officers
 principal financial officer
 principal accounting officer or controller
We have no employment agreements with our officers
We have no employment agreements with our officers

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts&#13;with Customers. ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition&#13;guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. Under ASU&#13;2014-09
 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that&#13;reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition
 the standard&#13;requires disclosure of the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.&#13;The FASB has recently issued ASU 2016-08
 ASU 2016-10
 ASU 2016-11
 ASU 2016-12
 ASU 2016-20
 and ASU 2017-05
 all of which clarify&#13;certain implementation guidance within ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December&#13;15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods&#13;therein. The standard can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method)
&#13;or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application&#13;(the cumulative catch-up transition method). The Company will adopt the provisions of this statement in the quarter beginning&#13;April 1

 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases. This update will require the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a&#13;corresponding lease liability
 initially measured at the present value of the lease payments
 for all leases with terms longer&#13;than 12 months. For operating leases
 the asset and liability will be expensed over the lease term on a straight-line basis
 with&#13;all cash flows included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. For finance leases
 interest on the lease liability&#13;will be recognized separately from the amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statement of comprehensive income and the&#13;repayment of the principal portion of the lease liability will be classified as a financing activity while the interest component&#13;will be included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting&#13;periods beginning after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption

 the FASB issued ASU 2016-01
 Financial Instruments &amp;#150; Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets&#13;and Financial Liabilities. ASU 2016-01 primarily affects equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
&#13;and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Among other things
 this new guidance requires certain&#13;equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. This standard is effective&#13;for reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 with certain provisions allowing for early adoption. The Company will&#13;adopt the provisions of this statement in the quarter beginning April 1

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts&#13;with Customers. ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition&#13;guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. Under ASU&#13;2014-09
 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that&#13;reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition
 the standard&#13;requires disclosure of the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.&#13;The FASB has recently issued ASU 2016-08
 ASU 2016-10
 ASU 2016-11
 ASU 2016-12
 ASU 2016-20
 and ASU 2017-05
 all of which clarify&#13;certain implementation guidance within ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December&#13;15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods&#13;therein. The standard can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method)
&#13;or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application&#13;(the cumulative catch-up transition method). The Company will adopt the provisions of this statement in the quarter beginning&#13;April 1

 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases. This update will require the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a&#13;corresponding lease liability
 initially measured at the present value of the lease payments
 for all leases with terms longer&#13;than 12 months. For operating leases
 the asset and liability will be expensed over the lease term on a straight-line basis
 with&#13;all cash flows included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. For finance leases
 interest on the lease liability&#13;will be recognized separately from the amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statement of comprehensive income and the&#13;repayment of the principal portion of the lease liability will be classified as a financing activity while the interest component&#13;will be included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting&#13;periods beginning after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption

 the FASB issued ASU 2016-01
 Financial Instruments &amp;#150; Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets&#13;and Financial Liabilities. ASU 2016-01 primarily affects equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
&#13;and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Among other things
 this new guidance requires certain&#13;equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. This standard is effective&#13;for reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 with certain provisions allowing for early adoption. The Company will&#13;adopt the provisions of this statement in the quarter beginning April 1

 2018
 the Company&#13;had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $2.0 million that may be available to reduce future years' taxable income&#13;through 2038. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements
&#13;as management has determined that their realization of the Company&amp;#8217;s net deferred tax assets of approximately $580
000 was&#13;not likely to occur and accordingly










 the Company may recognize the tax benefit from&#13;an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing&#13;authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such&#13;a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate&#13;settlement. These accounting rules also provide guidance on de-recognition
 classification
 interest and penalties on income taxes
&#13;accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. As of March 31

Description
of the Company

Applied
BioSciences Corp. (formerly First Fixtures
 Inc. and Stony Hill Corp. or the &#147;Company&#148;) was incorporated in the State
of Nevada on February 21
 2014 and established a fiscal year end of March 31. Effective October 24
 2016 the Company changed its
name from First Fixtures Inc. to Stony Hill Corp and on March 6
 2018
 the Company changed its name from Stony Hill Corp. to Applied
BioSciences Corp. The Company is focused on multiple areas of the hemp and CBD industry. Specifically
 the Company is focused
on select investments
 branding
 real estate
 and partnership opportunities in the recreational
 health and wellness
 nutraceutical
and media industries.



On
November 4
 2016
 the Company
 entered into a Share Exchange Agreement by and among the Company
 Stony Hill Ventures Corp. (&#147;Stony
Hill Ventures&#148;)
 and the holders of common stock of Stony Hill Ventures
 which consisted of 26 stockholders. Stony Hill
Ventures was incorporated on March 15
 2016
 in Nevada and was organized for various investments under the Stony Hill brand as
well as to conduct any other related business and activities.

Under
the terms and conditions of the Share Exchange Agreement
 the Company offered
 sold and issued 10
830
000 shares of common stock
of the Company in consideration for all the issued and outstanding shares in Stony Hill Ventures. The effect of the issuance was
Stony Hill Ventures became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and represents the Company&#146;s principal business.

The
merger between the Company and Stony Hill Ventures was treated as a reverse acquisition for financial statement reporting purposes
with Stony Hill Ventures deemed the accounting acquirer and the Company deemed the accounting acquiree. Accordingly
 Stony Hill
Ventures&#146; assets
 liabilities and results of operations became the historical financial statements of the Company. No step-up
in basis or intangible assets or goodwill was recorded in this transaction.

Going
concern

These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize
its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. As reflected in the consolidated
financial statements
 as of March 31
 2018 the Company has incurred a net loss of $2
386
864 and used $673
467 of cash from operating
activities during the fiscal year ended March 31
 2018. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability
to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

The Company&#146;s ability to
continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital and to ultimately achieve sustainable revenues
and income from operations. During the fiscal year ended March 31
 2018
 the Company raised $795
000 through the sale of 497
500
aggregate shares of its common stock to accredited investors. As of March 31
 2018
 cash on hand was $60
934 and management estimates
that the current funds on hand will not be sufficient to continue operations without obtaining additional funds. As such
 the
Company is currently working on obtaining additional funds to operate its business through and beyond the date of this Form 10-K
filing. However
 there is no assurance that such funds will be available or at terms acceptable to the Company. Even if the Company
is able to obtain additional financing

Principles
of Consolidation


The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries
 Stony Hill Ventures Corp.
a Nevada corporation
 Applied Products LLC
 a Washington limited liability&#160;company
 and&#160;SH Holdings LLC and SH Products
LLC
 both&#160;Nevada limited liability companies. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Management evaluates its investments on an individual basis for purposes of determining whether or not consolidation is appropriate.


Use
of Estimates and Assumptions

Preparation
of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Among
other things
 management estimates include the collectability of its accounts receivable
 recoverability of inventory
 assumptions
made in determining impairment of investments and intangible assets
 accruals for potential liabilities
 and realization of deferred
tax assets. These estimates generally involve complex issues and require judgments
 involve analysis of historical information
and the prediction of future trends
 and are subject to change from period to period. Actual amounts could differ significantly
from these estimates.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The
Company follows paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Paragraph 820-10-35-37&#148;) to
measure the fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for
disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value
in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP)
 and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures
 Paragraph 820-10-35-37
establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three
(3) broad levels. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:



Level
    1
    
Quoted
    market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.

    
    
    

Level
    2
    
Pricing
    inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable
    as of the reporting date.

    
    
    

Level
    3
    
Pricing
    inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.


Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models
 discounted cash flow methodologies or
similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.

The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within
more than one level described above
 the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement of the instrument.

The
carrying amounts of the Company&#146;s financial assets and liabilities
 such as accounts receivables and accounts payable approximate
their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. The Company uses Level 3 inputs for its investments.

Revenue
Recognition

The
Company receives revenue from two main sources - license fees and sale of products. For license fees
 revenue arrangements provide
for the payment of contractually determined monthly ongoing fees in consideration for the grant of right to use intellectual property
of the Company
 including trademark
 trade dress
 images
 likenesses and other associated intellectual property. Revenue from
product sales relate to shipments of cannabidiol (&#147;CBD&#148;) brand products. There is no right of returns other than for
goods damaged during shipment.

For
both license fees and sale of products
 revenue is recognized when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 (ii) all
obligations have been substantially performed pursuant to the terms of the arrangement
 (iii) amounts are fixed or determinable
and (iv) the collectibility of amounts is reasonably assured.

Shipping
Cost

The
Company recognizes amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction related to shipping as revenue. The costs incurred by the
Company for shipping are classified as cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.



The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense for the fiscal periods ended March 31
 2018 and 2017 amounted
to $193
977 and $15
414
 respectively
 and were included in &#34;General and Administrative expenses&#34; in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.



Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined principally on a first-in-first-out average cost basis. Inventories
consist of finished goods held for sale. Management regularly reviews inventory quantities on-hand and records an inventory provision
for excess or obsolete inventory based on the future expected demand for our products. Inventory write-downs are measured as the
difference between the cost of the inventory and market value
 based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently
difficult to assess. There was no provision for inventory obsolescence necessary as of March 31
 2018 and 2017.

Property
and Equipment

Property
and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets. The Company uses an estimated useful life of three years for employee-related computers and software
 three years
for other office equipment and computer hardware
 and five years for furniture. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
shorter of the lease-term or the estimated useful life of the related asset.

Management
regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Based upon
management&#146;s annual assessment
 there were no indicators of impairment of the Company&#146;s property and equipment and
other long-lived assets as of March 31
 2018.

Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts
receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
 net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is
based on the Company&#146;s assessment of the collectability of accounts. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance
for doubtful accounts by considering the age of each outstanding invoice and the collection history of each customer to determine
whether a specific allowance is appropriate. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectable are charged against the allowance for doubtful
accounts when identified. As of March 31
 2018 and 2017
 the allowance for doubtful accounts was $2
227 and nil
 respectively.

Earnings
(Loss) per Share

The
basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company&#146;s net income (loss) available to common shareholders
by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing
the Company&#146;s net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the period. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted average number of shares adjusted
for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share
due to the lack of dilutive items.



For
investments that are not required to be consolidated
 the Company uses either the equity method or the cost method of accounting.
The Company uses the equity method for unconsolidated equity investments in which the Company is considered to have significant
influence over the operations of the investee. The Company uses the cost method for all other investments. Under the cost method
there is no change to the cost basis unless there is an other-than-temporary decline in value or dividends are received. If the
decline is determined to be other-than-temporary
 the Company writes down the cost basis of the investment to a new cost basis
that represents realizable value. Investments&#160;accounted for under the equity method or cost method of accounting above are
included in the caption &#34;Equity investments&#34; on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Intangible
Asset

Intangible
assets are recorded when such assets are acquired and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset. The
Company regularly reviews intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful lives have changed
from the original estimate or that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist
the Company assesses the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows
associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments
if any
 are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which the
impairment determination was made.

On
February 23
 2017
 the Company consummated an Asset Purchase Agreement (the &#147;Agreement&#148;) with mCig
 Inc. for the purchase
of the VitaCBD brand name. In connection with the Agreement
 the Company recorded intangible assets of $1
138
135. As of March
31
 2017
 the Company did&#160;not believe there were any indicators of impairment of its intangible asset given the recent acquisition.
During the fiscal year ended March 31
 2018
 sales of the VitaCBD products did not meet management&#146;s expectations and the
Company was not able to achieve the expected operating results. As a result
 the Company impaired the intangible asset related
to the acquisition of the&#160;VitaCBD brand name&#160;and recorded an impairment charge of $893
667
 representing the net book
value of intangibles at March 31
 2018
 after current year amortization of $224
512.

Stock
Based Compensation

The
Company accounts for employee and non-employee stock awards under ASC 718
 Compensation-Stock Compensation
 whereby equity instruments
issued to employees for services are recorded based on the fair value of the instrument issued at the grant date and recognized
over the requisite service period. The Company has not adopted a stock option plan as of March 31
 2018.

The
Company accounts for stock-based payments to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50
 Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees.
Stock-based payments to non-employees include grants of stock
 grants of stock options and issuances of warrants that are recognized
based on the value of the vested portion of the award over the requisite service period as measured at its then- current fair
value as of each financial reporting date.

Income
Taxes

The
Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.



The
Company operates in one segment for the distribution of products. In accordance with the &#147;Segment Reporting&#148; Topic
of the ASC
 the Company&#146;s chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer and President
who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Existing
guidance
 which is based on a management approach to segment reporting
 establishes requirements to report selected segment information
quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services
 major customers
 and the countries in which
the entity holds material assets and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation under &#147;Segment
Reporting&#148; due to their similar customer base and similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of products and services;
and procurement
 manufacturing and distribution processes. Since the Company operates in one segment
 all financial information
required by &#147;Segment Reporting&#148; can be found in the accompanying consolidated financial statements

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In
May 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts
with Customers. ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition
guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. Under ASU
2014-09
 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that
reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition
 the standard
requires disclosure of the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
The FASB has recently issued ASU 2016-08
 ASU 2016-10
 ASU 2016-11
 ASU 2016-12
 ASU 2016-20
 and ASU 2017-05
 all of which clarify
certain implementation guidance within ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December
15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods
therein. The standard can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method)
or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application
(the cumulative catch-up transition method). The Company will adopt the provisions of this statement in the quarter beginning
April 1
 2018. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 will not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures.

In
February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases. This update will require the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a
corresponding lease liability
 initially measured at the present value of the lease payments
 for all leases with terms longer
than 12 months. For operating leases
 the asset and liability will be expensed over the lease term on a straight-line basis
 with
all cash flows included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. For finance leases
 interest on the lease liability
will be recognized separately from the amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statement of comprehensive income and the
repayment of the principal portion of the lease liability will be classified as a financing activity while the interest component
will be included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting
periods beginning after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption
 leases will be recognized and measured
at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its financial statements and related disclosures.

In
January 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-01
 Financial Instruments &#150; Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities. ASU 2016-01 primarily affects equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Among other things
 this new guidance requires certain
equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. This standard is effective
for reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 with certain provisions allowing for early adoption. The Company will
adopt the provisions of this statement in the quarter beginning April 1
 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
of the adoption of ASU 2016-01 on its financial statements and related disclosures.

Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB
 including its Emerging Issues Task Force
 the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants
 and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact
on the Company's present or future consolidated financial statements.&#160;

 2018







On
February 23
 2017
 the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Asset Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with mCig
Inc.
 a Nevada corporation (&#8220;mCig&#8221;) for a total purchase price of $1
144
000
 consisting of the issuance of an aggregate
of 350
000 shares of common stock valued at $994
000
 and cash of $150
000. Of the 350
000 shares of common stock consideration
150
000 shares with total fair value of $426
000 have not been issued as of March 31
 2018. Upon acquisition
 the Company recorded
an intangible asset of $1
138
135 consisting of the Vita CBD brand name and $5
865 of inventory received from mCig. The VitaCBD
business is primarily a line of cannabidiol (&#8220;CBD&#8221;) retail brand products that include CBD tinctures
 ejuices
 edibles

providing a ten-day written notice prior of such termination.

Financial
Advisory Services Agreement

On
November 1
 2017
 the Company entered into a Financial Advisory Consulting Services Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) whereby
the Company hired an advisor to provide certain financial advisory services. The term of the agreement is segmented into two segments
with the first segment ended on January 31
 2018 with a term of 3 months and the second segment expiring on October 31
 2018 with
a term of 9 months. Under the first segment and second segment

222 shares of the
Company&#8217;s restricted common stock
 respectively. Such shares are deemed to be earned and vested on November 1
 2018 and
February 1
 2018
 respectively. During the current fiscal year ended March 31
 2018
 the Company issued the 40
000 shares due
under the first segment valued at $88
000. No shares were issued under the second segment; however
 the Company estimated the
fair value of the 22
222 shares under the segment to be approximately $44
000 based on the fair value of the Company&#8217;s common
stock at March 31
 2018
 and recognized expense of $9
778 for the fiscal year then ended. As such
 total expense under the Agreement
was $97
778
 which was reflected in the general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

In
accordance with the Agreement
 if the Company&#8217;s average closing price of its stock falls below $2.25 (&#8220;threshold price
per share&#8221;) on a split adjusted basis within a period of 90 days before and including May 4
 2018 and August 1
 2018
 respectively
the Company will be required to issue an adjusted number of shares based on a set formula defined in the Agreement.

The
Company has no tax provision for any period presented due to its history of operating losses. As of March 31
 2018
 the Company
had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $2.0 million that may be available to reduce future years' taxable income
through 2038. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements
as management has determined that their realization of the Company&#8217;s net deferred tax assets of approximately $580
000 was
not likely to occur and accordingly
 the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to
tax loss carry-forward.

Components

The
Company adopted accounting rules which address the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on
a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under these rules
 the Company may recognize the tax benefit from
an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such
a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. These accounting rules also provide guidance on de-recognition
 classification
 interest and penalties on income taxes
accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. As of March 31
 2018
 no liability for unrecognized tax benefits
was required to be recorded.



































The entire disclosure for income taxes. Disclosures may include net deferred tax liability or asset recognized in an enterprise's statement of financial position

On
October 1
 2017
 the Company entered into a two-year Commercial Lease Agreement (&#147;Lease&#148;) whereby the Company&#146;s
subsidiary
 Vita Products LLC
 leased 2
100 square feet of office space. The lease commenced on October 1
 2017 and requires the
Company to pay $2
750 per month (&#147;Base Rent&#148;) or $33
000 per year for a total commitment of $66
000. Beginning at
the end of the first year of the Lease and annually thereafter
 the Base Rent shall be increased by the same percentage as any
increase in the Consumer Price Index (&#147;CPI&#148;) as published by the U.S. Department of Labor for the most recent preceding
12 month period. In addition to the Base Rent
 the Company is required to pay
 on a pro rata basis
 any common area expenses.
The Lease required a security deposit of $5
500
 which the Company paid in September 2017. At the end of the Lease the Company
at its sole discretion
 has the right to extend the Lease term for one additional 12 month period at a rental rate commensurate
with the then current market conditions for a similar space in the same area.

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries
 Stony Hill Ventures Corp.
a Nevada corporation
 Applied Products LLC
 a Washington limited liability&#160;company
 and&#160;SH Holdings LLC and SH Products
LLC
 both&#160;Nevada limited liability companies. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Management evaluates its investments on an individual basis for purposes of determining whether or not consolidation is appropriate.






Preparation
of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Among
other things
 management estimates include the collectability of its accounts receivable
 recoverability of inventory
 assumptions
made in determining impairment of investments and intangible assets
 accruals for potential liabilities
 and realization of deferred
tax assets. These estimates generally involve complex issues and require judgments
 involve analysis of historical information
and the prediction of future trends
 and are subject to change from period to period. Actual amounts could differ significantly
from these estimates.




The
Company follows paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Paragraph 820-10-35-37&#148;) to
measure the fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for
disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value
in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP)
 and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures
 Paragraph 820-10-35-37
establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three
(3) broad levels. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:



Level
    1
    
Quoted
    market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.

    
    
    

Level
    2
    
Pricing
    inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable
    as of the reporting date.

    
    
    

Level
    3
    
Pricing
    inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.


Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models
 discounted cash flow methodologies or
similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.

The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within
more than one level described above
 the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement of the instrument.

The
carrying amounts of the Company&#146;s financial assets and liabilities
 such as accounts receivables and accounts payable approximate
their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. The Company uses Level 3 inputs for its investments.




The
Company receives revenue from two main sources - license fees and sale of products. For license fees
 revenue arrangements provide
for the payment of contractually determined monthly ongoing fees in consideration for the grant of right to use intellectual property
of the Company
 including trademark
 trade dress
 images
 likenesses and other associated intellectual property. Revenue from
product sales relate to shipments of cannabidiol (&#147;CBD&#148;) brand products. There is no right of returns other than for
goods damaged during shipment.

For
both license fees and sale of products
 revenue is recognized when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 (ii) all
obligations have been substantially performed pursuant to the terms of the arrangement
 (iii) amounts are fixed or determinable
and (iv) the collectibility of amounts is reasonably assured.




The
Company recognizes amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction related to shipping as revenue. The costs incurred by the
Company for shipping are classified as cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.




The Company expenses advertising
costs as incurred. Advertising expense for the fiscal periods ended March 31
 2018 and 2017 amounted to $193
977 and $15
414
respectively
 and were included in &#34;General and Administrative expenses&#34; in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.




Inventories are stated at the lower
of cost or market. Cost is determined principally on a first-in-first-out average cost basis. Inventories consist of finished
goods held for sale. Management regularly reviews inventory quantities on-hand and records an inventory provision for excess or
obsolete inventory based on the future expected demand for our products. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference
between the cost of the inventory and market value
 based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently difficult to
assess. There was no provision for inventory obsolescence necessary as of March 31
 2018 and 2017.




Property
and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets. The Company uses an estimated useful life of three years for employee-related computers and software
 three years
for other office equipment and computer hardware
 and five years for furniture. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
shorter of the lease-term or the estimated useful life of the related asset.

Management
regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Based upon
management&#146;s annual assessment
 there were no indicators of impairment of the Company&#146;s property and equipment and
other long-lived assets as of March 31
 2018.




Accounts receivable are recorded
at the invoiced amount
 net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Company&#146;s
assessment of the collectability of accounts. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts
by considering the age of each outstanding invoice and the collection history of each customer to determine whether a specific
allowance is appropriate. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when
identified. As of March 31
 2018
 and 2017
 the allowance for doubtful accounts was $2
227 and nil
 respectively.





The
basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company&#146;s net income (loss) available to common shareholders
by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing
the Company&#146;s net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the period. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted average number of shares adjusted
for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share
due to the lack of dilutive items.




For investments that are not required
to be consolidated
 the Company uses either the equity method or the cost method of accounting. The Company uses the equity method
for unconsolidated equity investments in which the Company is considered to have significant influence over the operations of
the investee. The Company uses the cost method for all other investments. Under the cost method
 there is no change to the cost
basis unless there is an other-than-temporary decline in value or dividends are received. If the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary
the Company writes down the cost basis of the investment to a new cost basis that represents realizable value. Investments&#160;accounted
for under the equity method or cost method of accounting above are included in the caption &#34;Equity investments&#34; on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.





Intangible
assets are recorded when such assets are acquired and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset. The
Company regularly reviews intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful lives have changed
from the original estimate or that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist
the Company assesses the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows
associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments
if any
 are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which the
impairment determination was made.

On
February 23
 2017
 the Company consummated an Asset Purchase Agreement (the &#147;Agreement&#148;) with mCig
 Inc. for the purchase
of the VitaCBD brand name. In connection with the Agreement
 the Company recorded intangible assets of $1
138
135. As of March
31
 2017
 the Company did&#160;not believe there were any indicators of impairment of its intangible asset given the recent acquisition.
During the fiscal year ended March 31
 2018
 sales of the VitaCBD products did not meet management&#146;s expectations and the
Company was not able to achieve the expected operating results. As a result
 the Company impaired the intangible asset related
to the acquisition of the&#160;VitaCBD brand name&#160;and recorded an impairment charge of $893
667
 representing the net book
value of intangibles at March 31
 2018
 after current year amortization of $224
512.




The
Company accounts for employee and non-employee stock awards under ASC 718
 Compensation-Stock Compensation
 whereby equity instruments
issued to employees for services are recorded based on the fair value of the instrument issued at the grant date and recognized
over the requisite service period. The Company has not adopted a stock option plan as of March 31
 2018.

The
Company accounts for stock-based payments to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50
 Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees.
Stock-based payments to non-employees include grants of stock
 grants of stock options and issuances of warrants that are recognized
based on the value of the vested portion of the award over the requisite service period as measured at its then- current fair
value as of each financial reporting date.




The Company follows the liability
method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially
enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.




The
Company operates in one segment for the distribution of products. In accordance with the &#147;Segment Reporting&#148; Topic
of the ASC
 the Company&#146;s chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer and President
who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Existing
guidance
 which is based on a management approach to segment reporting
 establishes requirements to report selected segment information
quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services
 major customers
 and the countries in which
the entity holds material assets and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation under &#147;Segment
Reporting&#148; due to their similar customer base and similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of products and services;
and procurement
 manufacturing and distribution processes. Since the Company operates in one segment
 all financial information
required by &#147;Segment Reporting&#148; can be found in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.





In
May 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts
with Customers. ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition
guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. Under ASU
2014-09
 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that
reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition
 the standard
requires disclosure of the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
The FASB has recently issued ASU 2016-08
 ASU 2016-10
 ASU 2016-11
 ASU 2016-12
 ASU 2016-20
 and ASU 2017-05
 all of which clarify
certain implementation guidance within ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December
15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods
therein. The standard can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method)
or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application
(the cumulative catch-up transition method). The Company will adopt the provisions of this statement in the quarter beginning
April 1
 2018. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 will not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures.

In
February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases. This update will require the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a
corresponding lease liability
 initially measured at the present value of the lease payments
 for all leases with terms longer
than 12 months. For operating leases
 the asset and liability will be expensed over the lease term on a straight-line basis
 with
all cash flows included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. For finance leases
 interest on the lease liability
will be recognized separately from the amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statement of comprehensive income and the
repayment of the principal portion of the lease liability will be classified as a financing activity while the interest component
will be included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting
periods beginning after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption
 leases will be recognized and measured
at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its financial statements and related disclosures.

In
January 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-01
 Financial Instruments &#150; Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities. ASU 2016-01 primarily affects equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Among other things
 this new guidance requires certain
equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. This standard is effective
for reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 with certain provisions allowing for early adoption. The Company will
adopt the provisions of this statement in the quarter beginning April 1
 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
of the adoption of ASU 2016-01 on its financial statements and related disclosures.

Other
