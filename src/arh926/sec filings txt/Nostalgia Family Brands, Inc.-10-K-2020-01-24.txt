800
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 5
In 2012
 we filed a registration statement with respect to the sale of up to 3
000
000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $0.10 per share. The registration statement went effective on August 13
The Company is an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; (&#8220;EGC&#8221;)
 that is exempt from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (&#8220;the JOBS Act&#8221;)
We aim to acquire ownership of and other rights to discontinued consumer product brands with the ultimate goal of reviving these products and commercializing them based on the concept that nostalgia for such brands will be a powerful incentive to purchase by the 55 and over population
 which we refer to in this report as the senior population. We believe that many formerly popular brand names that were discontinued by their parent company still resonate with the senior population and if so revived and made available in supermarkets and other retail establishments
We believe that as a person ages
 he or she often feels left behind and tends to remember the &#8220;good old days&#8221; when life was simpler. We believe we can tap into these feelings and use it as a trigger for purchasing decisions
 as studies have shown that seniors miss their youth and many of the products which they used during childhood that are no longer available. Older adults have a preference to purchase brands which have been established for a long time. We believe that the combination of familiarity and positive associations linger as a person ages
We are a newly established company and have limited operations. For the period from November 5
 2010 (Inception) to December 31
 2017
 we have not generated any revenue and incurred net losses of $127
672. Due to the &#8220;newly-established&#8221; nature of our business
 we expect to incur losses as we expand. To date
 our cash flow requirements have been met by an equity financing and debt. If we are unable to successfully generate sufficient profits or otherwise obtain additional funds for our working capital needs
 we may need to cease or curtail operations. Furthermore
 there is no assurance the net proceeds from any financing arrangement will be sufficient to cover cash requirements during the early stages of our operations. For these reasons
We intend to target for purchase the intellectual property and other rights to discontinued consumer product brands. We consider a product to be discontinued if it is no longer available at traditional retail levels such as grocery and drug stores
We do not currently own any brand names or have any products for sale. To date
 we have researched over 100 discontinued products and are focusing upon 20 of these products in following three categories of consumer products: candy
 food other than candy
 and personal products

An estimated 88 million people in the United States are over the age of 55 according to the World Factbook updated on September 24
 2015 (the &#8220;WF 2015&#8221;). We believe this large and growing segment of the population are a viable demographic market with more financial resources and an increasing awareness of their power as consumers.

Marketing
As demonstrated by the above Pew Research Center surveys
 due to the fact that there is still a substantial percentage (39%) of the U.S. senior population (exceeding 47 million persons) who do not use the internet
 we plan to market our anticipated product brands using a combination of radio and print media advertising. Advertising over the radio is expected to commence in the areas most concentrated with a senior population. Our website will not initially offer our products for sale
In addition
 we intend to purchase advertising space for particular regions of major weekend supplements including
 but not limited to
 Parade and AARP Magazine
 to target our market and advise the senior population that their favorite brands are once again available at retail stores in their area. We intend to purchase the advertising space through cash payments and payments in the form of shares of our common stock. We believe that advertising can be purchased for cash or stock with little or no lead time and at substantial discounts from prevailing market prices for &#8220;remainders&#8221; which are sections of a national run by these and other publications when not sold by print time; provided however
We expect that if and when demand is created through our advertising campaigns
 it will be easier to retain independent manufacturer&#8217;s representatives to sell our products to regional buyers at independent retailers and retailers will be more likely to stock our products as a result of advertising-generated demand. These independent representatives also obviate the need for us to have sales personnel on our payroll
We intend to ultimately sell our products primarily in the mass market retail channel in all 50 states
 including
 but not limited to
 supermarket chains
 drug stores
 gas station marts
We expect that all product production will initially be out-sourced to third-party manufacturers. We do not anticipate expenses with respect to inventory
Our proposed business is subject to significant competition. The food and consumer products industry is fragmented
 highly competitive and is dominated by large multinational companies including
 but not limited to
 Nestle
 Kraft Foods
 Mars
 Proctor &amp; Gamble and Unilever
 as well as smaller competitors
 many of whom have already established their brand name recognition in our proposed markets. In addition
 many of our competitors have significantly larger marketing personnel and financial resources than we have and competition for shelf space in grocery stores and other retail outlets is intense
We intend to offer distinctive products which address specific consumer needs. We will target the senior population where nostalgia is expected to be a strong motivator for purchases. However
 these efforts will not guarantee that we will be competitive or that our business plan will be successful. Further
We believe that competition is based primarily upon availability
 price
 quality and efficacy of products
 customer service
 brand name recognition and marketing and trade support
We do not own any intellectual property. As part of our acquisition strategy
 we will endeavor to purchase all relevant trademarks
 trade names
Other than time spent researching our proposed business and identifying potential product acquisitions
We do not presently have any employees other than our two executive officers
 neither of whom are expected to be full-time employees. Our officers are responsible for planning
 developing and operational duties
 and will continue to do so throughout the early stages of our growth. We have no intention of hiring employees until our business has been successfully launched and we have sufficient
 reliable revenue from our operations
 which is not expected for at least the next 12 months. Although we cannot reliably estimate the percentage of time each of our executive officers will spend on behalf of our Company prior to the successful launch of our business
 of which we can give no assurance of success
 they have each committed to spend such time as they deem reasonably necessary to launch our business. Mr. McDermitt is available to work as a full-time employee if and when we successfully launch our business. Mr. O&#8217;Donnell
 our CFO
We intend to retain independent manufacturer&#8217;s representations to seek buyers of our products
Our shares of common stock are not registered under the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction
 and accordingly there is no public trading market for our common stock. Further
 no public trading market is expected to develop in the foreseeable future unless and until the Company completes a business combination with an operating business and the Company thereafter files a registration statement under the Securities Act. Therefore
 outstanding shares of our common stock cannot be offered
 sold
 pledged or otherwise transferred unless subsequently registered pursuant to
 or exempt from registration under
 the Securities Act and any other applicable federal or state securities laws or regulations. Shares of our common stock cannot be sold under the exemptions from registration provided by Rule 144 or Section 4(a) (1) of the Securities Act (&#8220;Rule 144&#8221;) as long as the Company is designated a &#8220;shell company&#8221; and for 12 months after it ceases to be a &#8220;shell company&#8221;
 provided the Company otherwise is in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations. Compliance with the criteria for securing exemptions under federal securities laws and the securities laws of the various states is extremely complex

We qualify as an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; or &#8220;EGC&#8221; under the JOBS Act. As a result
 we are permitted to

 rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company
comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor&#8217;s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e.
submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes

 Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words

 as a Smaller Reporting Company and so long as we remain a Smaller Reporting Company
 we benefit from similar exemptions and exclusions as an Emerging Growth Company. In the event that we cease to be an Emerging Growth Company as a result of a lapse of the five year period

As a newly established company with an unproven business strategy
We were incorporated on November 5
 2010 and our business is in its early planning stages and has not commenced operations. Our business prospects are difficult to predict because of our limited operating history
 early stage of establishment and unproven business strategy. While we intend to focus on acquiring rights to and reviving discontinued consumer product brands
 there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our business plan. We may never generate revenues or attain profitable operations
We are uncertain of our ability to function as a going concern
To date
 we have completed only the initial stages of our business plan and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue
 if any
 from our business in order to achieve profitability. It is not possible at this time for us to predict with assurance the potential success of our business. The revenue and income potential of our proposed business and operations are as of yet unknown. Our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds by issuing debt or equity securities or otherwise. If we fail to raise sufficient capital when needed
 we will not be able to completely execute our business plan. As a result
Our business will fail if we are unable to identify
 acquire
 commercialize
The success of our business plan is dependent
 among other things
 on our ability to identify
 acquire
 commercialize
 market and sell discontinued consumer product brands. It is our current plan to purchase the intellectual property and other rights to certain discontinued consumer product brands; however
 we currently do not own any intellectual property and have not obtained any copyrights
We expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. These losses will occur because we do not yet have any revenues to offset the expenses associated with the development of our planned business. We cannot guarantee that we will ever become successful in generating sufficient revenues in the future. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues
 we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks
If our views on the purchasing power of nostalgia as a driver for sales of consumer products is erroneous
We believe that there is a potential market for the revival of discontinued consumer product brands based upon the strength of nostalgia in the senior population. We can give no assurance that our views on nostalgia or its use as a marketing tool to sell products will prove to be successful
 especially considering that any brands we may acquire were likely discontinued due to a lack of sales or popularity at such time. If such views turn out to be erroneous
We intend to enter a competitive market which could impact our ability to gain market share and accordingly
The market for consumer products is very competitive. Although we intend to differentiate ourselves from other companies
 there are a number of companies
 many of which are established
 adequately funded and which sell numerous products which would compete with any brands we may acquire. If we cannot gain shelf space for our planned products at retailers or gain market share
Our ability to successfully develop our business
 generate operating revenues and achieve profitability depends upon our ability to obtain the necessary financing to implement our business plan. We will require financing through the issuance of additional debt and/or equity in order to implement our business plan
 including identifying
 acquiring and distributing consumer products
 building inventory
 hiring additional personnel as needed and eventually establishing profitable operations. Such financing may not be forthcoming. As it has been widely reported
 global and domestic financial markets and economic conditions have been
 and continue to be
 disrupted and volatile due to a variety of factors
 including
 but not limited to
 weak economic conditions. As a result
 the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has increased substantially while the availability of funds from those markets has diminished significantly
 even more so for smaller companies like ours. If such conditions and constraints continue
 we may not be able to acquire funds either through credit markets or through equity markets and
 even if financing is available
If our estimates related to expenditures are erroneous or inaccurate
Our success is dependent in part upon the accuracy of our management&#8217;s estimates of expenditures for the next twelve months and beyond
 including
 but not limited to
 the expenditures we expect to incur as a public reporting company
 costs relating to acquiring rights to consumer product brands and commercialization of those brands
 website development
 and advertising and administrative expenses all of which management estimates will cost an aggregate minimum of approximately $300
000 over the next 12 months. If such estimates are erroneous or inaccurate
 or we encounter unforeseen expenses and delays
 we may not be able to carry out our business plan
If we are unable to identify and retain qualified personnel
We expect to be dependent on relationships with third parties in order to successfully commercialize our planned product lines. As a new company with very limited operating history and resources we may have difficulty in attracting and retaining the personnel required by us. If we are unable to fill those key positions or if we fail to hire or retain the necessary personnel
Our future success depends upon the continued service of Mr. William P. McDermitt
 our Chief Executive Officer and sole Director
 and Mr. Edward O&#8217;Donnell
 our Vice President
 Chief Financial Officer and Secretary
 upon whom we are relying to implement our business plan. The loss of the services of either Mr. McDermitt or Mr. O&#8217;Donnell could negatively impact our ability to select and commercialize potential brands
Each of our executive officers are part-time employees and have committed to spend such time as they deem reasonably necessary to launch our business. Our inability to have a full-time chief financial officer may make it more difficult to
 or cause a delay in
While we intend to rely heavily upon Mr. McDermitt
 he has no experience serving as an officer and/or director of a publicly traded company or experience with the reporting requirements which public companies are subject to. In addition
 Mr. McDermitt has no experience with the financial accounting and preparation requirements of financial statements which are required to be filed quarterly and annually under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended. Due to lack of financial resources
 we were unable to timely file a number of our annual and quarterly reports with the SEC in the past. Consequently
Although we are delinquent in our SEC filings due to lack of funding
 we are in the process of rectifying our delinquency. It is the management&#8217;s intention to meet the SEC&#8217;s requirements and to be up to date in all of our filings
 but we cannot insure it because of the Company&#8217;s lack of financial resources. It is possible that the SEC could take enforcement action against us
 including potentially the de-registration of our securities
 if we fail to file our annual and quarterly reports in a timely manner as required by the SEC. If the SEC were to take any such actions
In the event we are delinquent with respect to our reporting requirements in the future
 the Securities and Exchange Commission may revoke the registration of our common stock and
OTC Bulletin Board
If
 in the future
 we are delinquent with respect to our reporting requirements
 the Commission may revoke the registration of our common stock. If the Commission revokes the registration of our common stock
 brokers
 dealers and other market participants would be prohibited from buying
 selling
 making a market in
 publishing quotations of
 or otherwise effecting transactions with respect to such common stock until
 in the case of suspension
 the lifting of such suspension
 or
 in the case of a revocation
 we file a new registration statement with the Commission under the Exchange Act and that registration statement is declared effective. As a result
 public trading of our common stock would cease and investors would find it extraordinarily difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock or obtain accurate price quotations for our common stock
 which could result in a significant decline in the value of our stock. In addition
 any business which we acquire or start may be adversely impacted
 including
 without limitation
 an adverse impact on our ability to issue stock to raise equity capital
In addition
 if our shares become quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board
 we will be required to remain current in our filings with the SEC and our securities will not be eligible for quotation if we are not current in our filings with the SEC. In the event that we become delinquent in our required filings with the SEC
There is no public market for our securities and there can be no assurance that an active trading market for our Common Stock will develop
 or
 if developed
 be sustained. Our Common Stock may never be quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board
 or
 even if quoted
Because we will be subject to &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules if our shares are quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board
Broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in &#8220;penny stocks&#8221; are regulated by penny stock rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on some national securities exchanges). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer
 prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules
 to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock
 the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction
 and
 if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker
 the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer&#8217;s presumed control over the market
 and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer&#8217;s account. In addition
 broker-dealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and &#8220;accredited investors&#8221; must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser&#8217;s written agreement to the transaction. Consequently
 these requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity
 if any
 in the secondary market for a security subject to the penny stock rules. If a trading market does develop for our common stock
 these regulations will likely be applicable
FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer
 a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to non-institutional customers
 broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer&#8217;s financial status
 tax status
 investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules
 FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for certain customers. FINRA requirements will likely make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock
 which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in our common stock. As a result
 fewer broker-dealers may be willing to make a market in our common stock
State securities laws may limit secondary trading
Stockholders may not be able to resell the shares which they purchase in a certain state unless and until the shares of our common stock are qualified for secondary trading under the applicable securities laws of such state or there is confirmation that an exemption
 such as listing in certain recognized securities manuals
 is available for secondary trading in such state. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in registering or qualifying our common stock for secondary trading
 or identifying an available exemption for secondary trading in our common stock in every state. If we fail to register or qualify
 or to obtain or verify an exemption for the secondary trading of our common stock in any particular state
 the shares of common stock cannot be offered or sold to
 or purchased by
 a resident of that state. In the event that a significant number of states refuse to permit secondary trading in our common stock
 the market for the common stock will be limited
 which could drive down the market price of our common stock
 and reduce the liquidity of the shares of our common stock and a stockholder&#8217;s ability to resell shares of our common stock at all or at current market prices
If quoted
 the price of our common stock may be volatile
Even if our shares are quoted for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board or other over-the-counter market and a public market develops for our common stock
our announcements of the acquisition of assets and achievement of milestones
changes in financial estimates by securities analysts
Because we do not intend to pay any dividends on our common stock
We have not declared or paid any dividends on our common stock since our inception
 and we do not anticipate paying any such dividends for the foreseeable future. Accordingly
 holders of our common stock will have to rely upon capital appreciation
 if any
We are authorized to issue up to 50
000
000 shares of common stock
 $0.001 par value
 of which 3
800
000 shares of common stock are currently issued and outstanding. Our Board of Directors has the authority to cause us to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to determine the rights
 preferences and privilege of such shares
 without consent of any of our stockholders. We may issue shares in connection with financing arrangements or otherwise. Any such issuances will result in immediate dilution to our existing stockholders&#8217; interests
The market price of our common stock may decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales
 or the possibility that these sales may occur
 also may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling equity securities in the future
We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect
 if any
 that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock may have on the market price of our common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our common stock
 including
 but not limited to
 shares issued in connection with an acquisition or the perception that such sales or distributions could occur
Any issuance of preferred stock would make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock
Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the preferences
 limitations and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series
 without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock may be issued with voting
 liquidation
 dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us
We will incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company
 and our management will devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives. We may fail to comply with the rules that apply to public companies
We will incur significant legal
 accounting and other expenses as a public company
 including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended
 and regulations regarding corporate governance practices
 such as accurately and timely filing annual and interim reports
 soliciting proxies for annual and special meetings of stockholders
 conflicts of interest policies and a code of conduct. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements. Moreover
 the reporting requirements
 rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. Any changes we make to comply with these obligations may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely basis
 or at all. These reporting requirements
 rules and regulations
 coupled with the increase in potential litigation exposure associated with being a public company
 could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or board committees or to serve as executive officers
 or to obtain certain types of insurance
 including directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; insurance
After a public offering
 we will be subject to Section 404 of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules of the SEC
 which generally require our management and if we meet certain requirements
 our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Section 404 generally requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However
 for so long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act
 we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies
 including
 but not limited to
 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company or
 if prior to such date
 we opt to no longer take advantage of the applicable exemption
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of the Company. Management
 with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
 has evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2017. Based upon this evaluation
 Management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer
If we have a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting
 we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. We or our independent registered public accounting firm
 if required
 may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting
 which could harm our operating results
 cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and cause the trading price of our stock to fall. In addition
 failure to maintain an effective system of internal control
 or any other problems with our financial systems or internal controls
The JOBS Act permits &#8220;emerging growth companies&#8221; like us to rely on some of the reduced disclosure requirements that are already available to smaller reporting companies
 which are companies that have a non-affiliate public float of less than $75 million. As long as we qualify as an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company
 we would be permitted to omit the auditor&#8217;s attestation on internal control over financial reporting that would otherwise be required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 as described above and are also exempt from the requirement to submit &#8220;say-on-pay&#8221;
In addition
 Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this until we are no longer an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of this exemption. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. In addition
 the JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company to &#8220;test the waters&#8221; by communicating orally or in writing with qualified institutional buyers or other accredited investors to gauge interest in a contemplated securities offering
 even if a registration statement has not yet been filed
 and permits analysts to publish research reports about an emerging growth company that is going public even if the analyst&#8217;s firm is one of the underwriters in the issuer&#8217;s IPO. We have not provided any of such information to any qualified institutional buyers or other accredited investors
We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement
 (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion
 or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer
 which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30
 and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. Until such time
 however
 we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result

A claim against the Company was served on January 17
 2014 by Vintage Filings PR Newswire in the Superior Court of New Jersey for approximately $5
900 related to services rendered in 2012. The claim was settled in April 2014 for $6

 including fees
 which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheets. As of June 30
 2016
 $500.00 was paid by CUBBO
 Inc. with respect to the judgment. The plaintiff initially agreed to defer taking action to enforce the judgment; however
 the time frame which the plaintiff initially agreed upon has expired. The Company intends to negotiate an extension. On August 13
 2015 we filed with the Securities Exchange Commission a registration statement on Form S-1 to raise $350

 which was declared effective as of June 29

Item 5. Market for Common Equity
There is currently no public market for our common stock and we have not applied for listing or quotation on any public market. We intend to seek a market maker to file an application on our behalf to have our common stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. In order for such applicable to be accepted
 we will have to satisfy certain criteria in order for our common stock to be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. There can be no assurance that our common stock will ever be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or that any market for our common stock will develop. We currently have no market maker that is willing to list quotations for our common stock. There is no assurance that a trading market will develop
 or
 if developed
Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 50

We have not paid any dividends since our inception and do not anticipate the payment of dividends in the foreseeable future. At present
 our policy is to retain earnings
 if any
 to develop and market our business. The payment of dividends in the future will depend upon factors including
 but not limited to
 our earnings
 capital requirements
Except as set forth below
During the period between January 3
 2011 and January 13
 2012
 we issued 3
800
000 shares of our common stock to 44 investors
 at a purchase price of $0.01 per share
 or aggregate proceeds of $38
000. These shares were issued in a series of transactions in reliance upon an exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act set forth in Section 4(a)(5) thereof and Regulation D promulgated thereunder for transactions not involving any public offering. The Registrant believes that the exemption was available because the offer and sale of the securities did not involve a public offering and because of the limited number of recipients
 each of the purchaser&#8217;s representation of sophistication in financial matters
All purchasers represented in writing that they acquired the securities for their own accounts. A legend was placed on the stock certificates stating that the securities have not been registered pursuant to the Securities Act and cannot be sold or otherwise transferred without an effective registration or an exemption therefrom
To mitigate the current lack of financial resources
 on August 13
 2015
 the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) to raise $350
000. The SEC declared the registration statement effective as of June 29

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and information relating to our business that reflect our current views and assumptions with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties
 including the risks in the section entitled Risk Factors beginning on page 10
 that may cause our or our industry&#8217;s actual results
 levels of activity
 performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable
 we cannot guarantee future results

 or achievements. Except as required by applicable law
 including the securities laws of the United States
We aim to acquire ownership and other rights to discontinued consumer product brands
 with the ultimate goal of reviving these products and commercializing them
 based on an idea that nostalgia for such brands will be a powerful incentive to purchase among the senior population. We believe that many formerly popular brand names that were discontinued by their parent companies still resonate with the senior population and if so revived and made available in supermarkets and other retail establishments
We are a newly established company and have limited operations. For the period from November 5
 2010 (Inception) to December 31
 2017
 we have not generated any revenue and incurred net losses of $127
672. For the year ended December 31
 2017
 we have generated net losses of $6
589. Due to the &#8220;early&#8221; nature of our business
 we expect to incur losses as we expand. To date
 our cash flow requirements have been met in part by an equity financing and debt. If we are unable to successfully generate sufficient profits or otherwise obtain additional funds for our working capital needs
 we may need to cease or curtail operations. Furthermore
 there is no assurance the net proceeds from any successful financing arrangement will be sufficient to cover cash requirements during the initial stages of our operations. For these reasons
In April 2012
 the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus
 an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and
 as a result
As of the date of this Report on Form 10-K
 we have spent time researching our proposed business and identifying potential product acquisitions. We intend to purchase rights to

The success of our business plan is dependent
 among other things
 on our ability to identify
 acquire
 commercialize
 market and sell discontinued consumer product brands. Our business will fail if we cannot successfully implement our business plan
 or successfully market our planned products. Additionally
 if our views on the strength of nostalgia as a driver for sales of consumer products is erroneous
We are a newly established company with limited operating history. There is a limited operating history by which to evaluate the likelihood of our success or our ability to continue as a going concern. To date
 we have not generated any revenues. We will require additional funding in order to continue operations for the next 12 months. If we do complete the implementation of our business plan
 we may nevertheless not be able to generate sufficient revenues to become profitable
 and will likely need additional funding to continue operations. We may never secure any additional funding necessary to continue our operations. On August 13
 2015 we filed with the Securities Exchange Commission a registration statement on Form S-1 to raise $350

 the Company changed its accountant from Wei Wei &amp; Co.

The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the Commission&#8217;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer&#8217;s management
 including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers
 or persons performing similar functions
In accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15
 an evaluation was completed by the Company&#8217;s management
 with the participation of the Company&#8217;s President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Company&#8217;s management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the periods covered by this quarterly report. Based on that evaluation
 the Company&#8217;s management concluded that the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act
 is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms
 and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company&#8217;s management
 including the Company&#8217;s CEO
 to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure for the reasons discussed below. However
 because of the Company&#8217;s lack of financial resources
The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Our internal control system was designed to
 in general
 provide reasonable assurance to the Company&#8217;s management and board regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements
 but because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
Our management assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2017. The framework used by management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled &#8220;Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework 2013&#8221; issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment
 our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has determined and concluded that
 as of December 31
 2017
A material weakness is a deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company&#8217;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control our financial reporting as of December 31
 2017
There have been no significant changes to the Company&#8217;s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our fiscal year ended December 31
 2017 that materially affected
 or were reasonably likely to materially affect

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;). In the opinion of management
 such information contains all adjustments
 consisting only of normal recurring adjustments
 necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented.









All sources of revenue will be recorded pursuant to FASB ASC 605
 
 when persuasive evidence of arrangement exists

 the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.




The Company records a beneficial conversion feature (&#8220;BCF&#8221;) related to the issuance of convertible debt that has conversion features at fixed or adjustable rates that are in-the-money when issued. The BCF for the convertible instruments
 if any
 is recognized and measured as a reduction to the carrying amount of the convertible instrument equal to the relative fair value of the conversion features
 which is credited to additional paid-in-capital.




The Company recognizes deferred income taxes for differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences for those differences
 which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future taxable income. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 









Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the amount available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share includes the effect of dilutive common stock equivalents from the assumed exercise of options
 warrants
 convertible preferred stock and convertible notes. The Company&#8217;s common stock equivalents were excluded in the computation of diluted net (loss) per share since their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. There are no dilutive securities issued for the periods presented in the accompanying financial statements.

 US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
 Other Comprehensive Basis of Accounting
 IFRS).

 (2) whether the entity's cash and cash equivalents are insured or expose the entity to credit risk
 (3) the classification of any negative balance accounts (overdrafts)
 and (4) the carrying basis of cash equivalents (for example
 at cost) and whether the carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value.




























Disclosure of accounting policy related to debt. Includes
 but is not limited to
 debt issuance costs
 the effects of refinancings
 method of amortizing debt issuance costs and original issue discount
 and classifications of debt.




























Disclosure of accounting policy for computing basic and diluted earnings or loss per share for each class of common stock and participating security. Addresses all significant policy factors
 including any antidilutive items that have been excluded from the computation and takes into account stock dividends
 splits and reverse splits that occur after the balance sheet date of the latest reporting period but before the issuance of the financial statements.

 which may include its accounting policies for recognizing and measuring deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowances
 recognizing investment tax credits
 operating loss carryforwards
 tax credit carryforwards
 and other carryforwards

Disclosure of accounting policy pertaining to new accounting pronouncements that may impact the entity's financial reporting. Includes

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;). In the opinion of management
 such information contains all adjustments
 consisting only of normal recurring adjustments
All sources of revenue will be recorded pursuant to FASB ASC 605
 
 when persuasive evidence of arrangement exists
 delivery has occurred
The Company records a beneficial conversion feature (&#8220;BCF&#8221;) related to the issuance of convertible debt that has conversion features at fixed or adjustable rates that are in-the-money when issued. The BCF for the convertible instruments
 if any
 is recognized and measured as a reduction to the carrying amount of the convertible instrument equal to the relative fair value of the conversion features
The Company recognizes deferred income taxes for differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences for those differences
Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the amount available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share includes the effect of dilutive common stock equivalents from the assumed exercise of options
 warrants
 convertible preferred stock and convertible notes. The Company&#8217;s common stock equivalents were excluded in the computation of diluted net (loss) per share since their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. There are no dilutive securities issued for the periods presented in the accompanying financial statements.

The Company&#8217;s financial statements have been presented on a going concern basis
 which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company is subject to the substantial business risks and uncertainties inherent to such an entity
 including the potential risk of business failure. The Company has not generated any revenues since inception. While the Company is attempting to commence operations and generate revenues
While the Company believes in its ability to raise additional funds and the viability of its strategy
 there can be no assurances that they will be successful. The Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its stockholders and its ability to obtain the necessary equity or debt financing and eventually attain profitable operations. 



































The entire disclosure when substantial doubt is raised about the ability to continue as a going concern. Includes
 but is not limited to
 principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern
 management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the ability to meet its obligations
 and management's plans that alleviated or are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern.
