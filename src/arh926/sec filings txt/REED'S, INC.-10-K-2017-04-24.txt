Historical
Development

Reed&rsquo;s
Original Ginger Brew  created in 1987 by Christopher J. Reed
 our founder
 former Chief Executive Officer
 and
current Chief Innovation Officer was introduced to the market in Southern California stores in 1989. By 1990
 we began
marketing our products through United Natural Foods Inc. (UNFI) and other natural food distributors and moved our production
to a larger facility in Boulder
 Colorado.



 we incorporated our business operations
in the state of Florida under the name of Original Beverage Corporation and moved all production to a co-pack facility
in Pennsylvania. Throughout the 1990&rsquo;s
 we continued to develop and launch new Ginger Brew varieties. Reed&rsquo;s Ginger
Brews reached broad placement in natural and gourmet foods stores nationwide through UNFI and other major specialty
 natural/gourmet
and mainstream food and beverage distributors.




 we began licensing the products of
China Cola and eventually acquired the rights to that product in 2000. In 1999
 we purchased the Virgil&rsquo;s Root Beer brand
from the Crowley Beverage Company. In 2000
 we moved into an 18
000-square foot warehouse property
 the Brewery
 in Los
Angeles
 California
 to house our west coast production and warehouse facility. The Brewery also serves as our principal executive
offices. In 2001
 pursuant to a reincorporation merger
 we changed our state of incorporation to Delaware and also changed our
name to &ldquo;Reed&rsquo;s
 Inc.&rdquo;


On
December 12
 2006
 we completed the sale of 2
000
000 shares of our common stock at an offering price of $4.00 per share in our
initial public offering. The public offering resulted in gross proceeds of $8
000
000. Following the public offering
 we expanded
sales and operations dramatically
 initially using a direct store delivery strategy in Southern California
 along with other regional
independent direct store distributors (DSD). The relationships with DSD&rsquo;s were supported by our sales staff. In 2007 we
raised a net of $7
600
000 in a private placement. We re-focused our sales strategy to eliminate company direct store delivery
sales and to expand sales to DSD&rsquo;s and natural food distributors on a national level. We also started selling directly to
supermarket grocery stores
 which has become a significant portion of our business today.

We
continually introduce new products and line extensions
 such as our California Juice Company products in 2009
 Virgil&rsquo;s
diet line of ZERO beverages introduced in 2010 and Dr. Better and Light 55 Calories Extra Ginger Brew in 2011. We commenced offering
private label products in 2010 and in 2012 we launched our Culture Club Kombucha line that has been expanded as sales have grown.
In 2015 we launched Stronger Ginger Brew that contains 50% more fresh ginger than our best-selling Reed&rsquo;s Extra Ginger Brew.

Industry
Overview

We
offer natural premium carbonated soft drinks (CSD)
 which are a growing segment of the estimated $10 billion CSD market nationwide.
Within natural food store markets
 we are among the top-selling natural soft drinks. This market is steady and growing. We also
sell in major grocery chains nationally. The trend in grocery stores is to expand offerings of natural products and we have the
scale and capability to develop these direct customer relationships.

Our
Products

We
primarily manufacture and sell beverages and candies or other ginger related products. We make all of our products using premium
all-natural ingredients and our beverage line is GMO free. Our primary brands are our Reed&rsquo;s ginger brew line
 our Virgil&rsquo;s
line of root beer and our Culture Club Kombucha. Our candy products that include Reed&rsquo;s Crystallized Ginger Candy and Reed&rsquo;s
Chews represent a lesser portion of revenues. We have sold ginger ice cream in prior years.

Reed&rsquo;s
Ginger Brews

Ginger
ale is the oldest known soft drink. Before modern soft drink technology existed
 non-alcoholic beverages were brewed at home directly
from herbs
 roots
 spices
 and fruits. These handcrafted brews were highly prized for their taste and their tonic
 health-giving
properties. Reed&rsquo;s Ginger Brews are a revival of this lost art of home brewing sodas. We make them with care and attention
to wholesomeness and quality
 using the finest fresh herbs
 roots
 spices
 and fruits.

We
believe that Reed&rsquo;s Ginger Brews are unique in their kettle-brewed origin among all mass-marketed soft drinks. Reed&rsquo;s
Ginger Brews contain between 8 and 39 grams of fresh ginger in every 12-ounce bottle. We use pure cane sugar as the sweetener.
Our products differ from commercial soft drinks in three particular characteristics: sweetening
 carbonation and coloring for
greater adult appeal. Instead of using injected-based carbonation
 we produce our carbonation naturally
 through slower
 beer-oriented
techniques. This process produces smaller
 longer lasting bubbles that do not dissipate rapidly when the bottle is opened. We
do not add coloring. The color of our products comes naturally from herbs
 fruits
 spices
 roots and juices and our beverages
are GMO free.


    
    


In
addition
 since Reed&rsquo;s Ginger Brews are pasteurized
 they do not require or contain any preservatives. In contrast
 modern
commercial soft drinks generally are produced using natural and artificial flavor concentrates prepared by flavor laboratories
tap water
 and highly refined sweeteners. Typically
 manufacturers make a centrally processed concentrate that will lend itself
to a wide variety of situations
 waters and filling systems. The final product is generally cold-filled and requires preservatives
for stability. Colors are added that are either natural
 although highly processed
 or artificial.

Our
Reed&rsquo;s line contains the following products:



    
Reed&rsquo;s
    Original Ginger Brew
    root
 lemon
 lime
 honey
 raw cane sugar
 pineapple
 herbs and spices. Reed&rsquo;s Original Ginger Brew is 20% fruit juice.

    cloves and allspice. Reed&rsquo;s Spiced Apple Brew is 50% apple juice.

    
    

    
Reed&rsquo;s
    Cherry Ginger Brew
 cherry juice from concentrate and spices. 

    
    

    
Reed&rsquo;s
    Light 55 Calories Extra Ginger Brew

Virgil&rsquo;s
Root Beer

Virgil&rsquo;s
is a premium craft root beer. We use all-natural ingredients
 including filtered water
 unbleached cane sugar
 anise from Spain
licorice from France
 bourbon vanilla from Madagascar
 cinnamon from Sri Lanka
 clove from Indonesia
 wintergreen from China
sweet birch and molasses from the southern United States
 nutmeg from Indonesia
 pimento berry oil from Jamaica
 balsam oil from
Peru and cassia oil from China. We collect these ingredients worldwide and gather them together at the brewing and bottling facilities.
We combine these ingredients under strict specifications and finally heat-pasteurize Virgil&rsquo;s Root Beer
 to ensure quality.
We sell Virgil&rsquo;s Root Beer in three packaging styles: 12-ounce bottles in a four-pack
 a special swing-lid style pint bottle
and a 5-liter self-tapping party keg. The Virgil&rsquo;s soda line is GMO free.

In
addition to our Virgil&rsquo;s Root Beer
 we also offer the following products under our Virgil&rsquo;s brand:

 and


Reed&rsquo;s
Culture Club Kombucha

We
introduced our Culture Club Kombucha in 2012. Kombucha is a fermented tea that dates its origin back thousands of years. Among
consumers
 Kombucha is believed to have healing and cleansing characteristics. Sweetened tea is introduced to a &ldquo;starter&rdquo;
culture and lightly fermented to produce an acetic drink. We make the finest Kombucha possible
 using a combination of Oolong
and Yerba Mate teas
 spring water and a combination of ginger
 organic juices and flavors Initially
 we produced four flavors
Goji Ginger
 Hibiscus Ginger Grapefruit
 Lemon Ginger Raspberry and Cranberry Ginger. We introduced four additional flavors in
2013
 Pomegranate Ginger
 Coconut Water Lime
 Cabernet Grape
 and Passion Mango Ginger.


    
    


Other
Beverage Brands

We
have other popular brands that currently have limited distribution
 including China Cola
 California Juice
 Sonoma Sparkler and
Flying Cauldron Butterscotch Beer. We are continually developing new brands and products.

Private
Label Products

We
design and manufacture drinks for private label customers in multiple facilities. We are experts in flavor development and in
matching existing products in the market. We develop the recipe and may design the label and/or the bottle style. We do not private
label any of our own branded product recipes.

Our
private label products have been variations of any of our offerings. We develop the sources for glass and ingredients. We have
a variety of packaging options
 including swing-lid bottles
 foil capsules and various label types. Our Los Angeles facility is
certified as SQF level 2 compliant.

New
Product Development

We
are always working on ideas and products to continue expanding our Reed&rsquo;s Ginger Brews
 Virgil&rsquo;s product line
 Reed&rsquo;s
Ginger Candy product lines and packaging styles. Current focus in our research is for reduced sugar offerings. Among the advantages
of our self-operated Brewery are the flexibility to try innovative packaging and the capability to experiment with new product
flavors at less cost to our operations or capital.

We
have developed and are currently field testing an all-natural fountain offering. We expect the testing to be completed in 2017
and to begin distribution later in the year.

Our
private label products require continual product development. We are able to be nimble and innovative
 producing new products
in a short amount of time.

Manufacture

    packing
 or co-pack facilities in Pennsylvania and an additional co-packer in Indiana which supplies us with product we do
    not produce at The Brewery. The co-packer assembles our products and charges us a fee
 generally by the case
 for the products
    they produce.


We
follow a &ldquo;fill as needed&rdquo; manufacturing model to the best of our ability and we have no significant backlog of orders.
Substantially all of the raw materials used in the preparation
 bottling and packaging of our products are purchased by us or
by our contract packers in accordance with our specifications. Reed&rsquo;s Crystallized Ginger is made to our specifications
in Fiji. Reed&rsquo;s Ginger Candy Chews are made and packed to our specifications in Indonesia.

Generally
we obtain the ingredients used in our products from domestic suppliers and each ingredient has several reliable suppliers. We
have no major supply contracts with any of our suppliers. As a general policy
 we pick ingredients in the development of our products
that have multiple suppliers and are common ingredients. This provides a level of protection against a major supply constriction
or calamity.

We
believe that as we continue to grow
 we will be able to keep up with increased production demands. The LA Brewery is nearing the
completion of a major renovation that we believe will allow the Brewery to handle the entire West Coast business and to absorb
significant increases in general sales. To the extent that any significant increase in business requires us to supplement or substitute
our current co-packers
 we are developing a pre-qualification for all prospective co-packers
 so that there would not be a significant
delay or interruption in fulfilling orders and delivery of our products. In addition
 we do not believe that growth will result
in any significant difficulty or delay in obtaining raw materials
 ingredients or finished product that is repackaged at the Brewery.


    
    


Our
Primary Markets

We
target a niche in the estimated $100 billion carbonated and non-carbonated soft drink markets in the US
 Canada and International
markets. Our brands are generally regarded as premium and natural
 with upscale packaging and are loosely defined as the artisanal
(craft)
 premium bottled carbonated soft drink category.

The
soft drink industry is highly fragmented and the craft soft drink category consists of such competitors as
 Henry Weinhards
 Thomas
Kemper
 Hansen&rsquo;s
 Izze
 Boylan and Jones Soda
 to name a few. These brands have the advantage of being seen widely in the
national market and being commonly known for years through well-funded ad campaigns. Despite our products having a relatively
high price for an artisanal premium beverage product
 minimal mass media advertising and a relatively small but growing presence
in the mainstream market compared to many of our competitors
 we believe that results to date demonstrate that Reed&rsquo;s Ginger
Brews and Virgil&rsquo;s sodas are making strong inroads and market share gains against some of the larger brands in the market.

Kombucha
is the largest growth segment of the functional beverage category of drinks and foods
 including coconut water
 yogurt and fresh
juices. Among this broader category
 the refrigerated juices and functional beverages segment grew by approximately $200 million
in 2012 to an estimated market of approximately $600 million (50% growth)
 according to SPINS data. We are preparing an exciting
relaunch of these brands in 2017 and expect to gain back a significant amount of lost space. Kombucha comprises the overwhelming
majority share of this explosive growth and comprises most of the segment. It is generally believed that the segment will continue
to expand at a strong rate over the next few years. Other functional drinks in this category are also expanding sales at healthy
rates
 primarily coconut water and fresh pressed juices. Consumer awareness and demand for functional drinks is increasing and
we feel that Kombucha and other cultured drinks will be in the forefront of this expanding market category.

We
sell the majority of our products in the natural food store
 mainstream supermarket chains and foodservice locations
 primarily
in the United States and
 to a lesser degree
 in Canada and Europe.

Natural
Food Stores

Our
primary and historical marketing and distribution source of our products has been natural food and gourmet stores throughout the
US. These stores include Whole Foods Market
 Trader Joe&rsquo;s
 Sprouts
 The Fresh Market
 Earth Fare
 and New Seasons
 just
to name a few. Our brands are also sold in gourmet restaurants and deli&rsquo;s nationwide. With the advent of large natural food
store chains and specialty merchants
 the natural foods segment continues to grow each year
 helping fuel the continued growth
of our brands.

Mainstream
Supermarkets and Retailers

We
also sell our products to direct store delivery distributors (DSD) who specialize in distributing and selling our products directly
to mainstream retail channels
 natural foods
 and specialty retail stores. Our brands are further sold directly to some retailers
who require that we sell directly to their distribution centers since they have developed their own logistics capabilities. Examples
of chains that fall into the &ldquo;direct&rdquo; category are retailers such as
 Costco
 Trader Joe&rsquo;s
 some Whole Foods
Market Regions and Kroger.

Supermarkets
particularly supermarket chains and prominent local/regional chains
 often impose slotting fees in order to gain shelf presence
within their stores. These fees can be structured to be paid one-time only or in installments. We utilize selective slotting in
supermarket chains throughout the US and to a lesser degree
 in Canada. However
 our local and national sales team has been able
to place our products without having to pay significant slotting fees. Slotting fees for new item placements on average have cost
anywhere between $10 to $150 per store
 per new item.

Food
Service Placement

We
also market our beverages to industrial cafeterias (corporate feeders)
 and to on premise bars and restaurants. As our business
continues to mature
 we intend to place our beverages in stadiums
 sport arenas
 concert halls
 theatres
 and other cultural centers
as long-term marketing and pouring relationships are developed within this business segment.


    
    


International
Sales

We
have developed a limited market for our products in Canada
 Europe and Asia. Sales outside of North America currently represent
3% of our total gross sales. Sales in Canada represent about 1.3% of our total sales. We believe that there are good opportunities
for expansion of sales in Canada
 Middle East
 England and Australia and we are increasing our marketing focus on those markets.
Other international sales become cost prohibitive
 except in specialty sales circumstances
 since our premium sodas are packed
in glass
 which involves substantial freight to move overseas. We are open to opportunities to export and to co-pack internationally
and expand our brands into foreign markets
 and we are holding preliminary discussions with trading companies and import/export
companies for the distribution of our products throughout Asia
 Europe
 Australia and South America. We believe that these areas
are a natural fit for Reed&rsquo;s ginger products
 because of the importance of ginger in international markets
 especially the
Asian market where ginger is a significant part of diet and nutrition.

Distribution
Sales and Marketing

We
currently have a national network of mainstream
 natural and specialty food distributors in the United States and Canada. We sell
directly to our distributors
 who in turn sell to retail stores. We also use our own internal sales force and independent sales
representatives to promote our products for our distributors and direct sales to our retail customers. One of the main goals of
our sales and marketing efforts is to increase sales and grow our brands. Our sales force consists of senior sales representatives
in five geographic regions across the country who are supported in their region by local Reeds sales staff. Generally
 our sales
managers are responsible for all activities related to the sales
 distribution and marketing of our brands to our entire distributor
and retail partner network in North America. We distribute our products primarily through several national natural foods distributors
and an increasing number of regional mainstream DSD distributors. We have entered into agreements with some of our distributors
that commit us to &ldquo;termination fees&rdquo; if we terminate our agreements early or without cause. These agreements call
for our customer to have the right to distribute our products to a defined type of retailer within a defined geographic region.
As is customary in the beverage industry
 if we should terminate the agreement or not automatically renew the agreement
 we would
be obligated to make certain payments to our customers. We are in constant review of our distribution agreement with our partners
across North America. We also offer our products and promotional merchandise directly to consumers via the Internet through our
website
 

Marketing
to Distributors

We
market to distributors using a number of marketing strategies
 including direct solicitation
 telemarketing
 trade advertising
and trade show exhibition. These distributors include natural food
 gourmet food and mainstream distributors. Our distributors
sell our products directly to natural food
 gourmet food and mainstream supermarkets for sale to the public. We maintain direct
contact with our distributor partners through our in-house sales managers. From time to time and in very limited markets
 when
use of our own sales force is not cost effective
 we will utilize independent sales brokers and outside representatives.

Marketing
to Retail Stores

The
primary focus of our sales efforts is supermarket sales. We have a small highly trained sales force that is directly contacting
supermarket chains and setting up promotional calendars. In addition
 we market to retail stores by utilizing trade shows
 trade
advertising
 telemarketing
 direct mail pieces and direct contact with the store. Our sales managers and representatives visit
these retail stores to sell directly in many regions. Sales to retail stores are coordinated through our distribution network
and our regional warehouses.



The
beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing
 packaging
 development of new products
and flavors and marketing campaigns. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of
manufacturers. Most of these brands have enjoyed broad
 well-established national recognition for years
 through well-funded ad
and other branding campaigns. In addition
 the company&rsquo;s manufacturing these products generally have greater financial
marketing and distribution resources than we do. Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include taste
and flavor of products
 trade and consumer promotions
 rapid and effective development of new
 unique cutting edge products
 attractive
and different packaging
 branded product advertising and pricing. We also compete for distributors who will concentrate on marketing
our products over those of our competitors
 provide stable and reliable distribution and secure adequate shelf space in retail
outlets. Competitive pressures in the soft drink category could cause our products to be unable to gain or to lose market share
or we could experience price erosion. We believe that our all natural innovative beverage recipes
 packaging
 use of premium ingredients
and a trade secret brewing process provide us with a competitive advantage and that our commitments to the highest quality standards
and brand innovation are keys to our success.


    
    


The
Kombucha market is dominated by a few producers who sell their products nationally. The remainder of the producers is comprised
of mostly fragmented regional or local companies. There are companies that gain market share in certain regions; however
 most
do not have the scale and capability to effectively sell and distribute on a national basis. We believe that Reed&rsquo;s Kombucha
market share was achieved in a relatively short period of time
 by leveraging our existing distribution channels and customer
relationships to expand our sales volume quickly. We also have in-house production capabilities that can be scaled up as needed
to make this a primary brand for Reed&rsquo;s. We believe that our existing infrastructure creates a competitive advantage
 including
product design
 manufacturing &amp; production and a network of sales &amp; distribution.

Proprietary
Rights

We
own trademarks that we consider material to our business. Three of our material trademarks are registered trademarks in the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office: Reed&rsquo;s Original Ginger Brew All-Natural Jamaican Style Ginger Ale &reg;
 Virgil&rsquo;s &reg;
and China Cola &reg;. Registrations for trademarks in the United States will last indefinitely as long as we continue to use and
police the trademarks and renew filings with the applicable governmental offices. We have not been challenged in our right to
use any of our material trademarks in the United States. We intend to obtain international registration of certain trademarks
in foreign jurisdictions.

In
addition
 we consider our finished product and concentrate formulae
 which are not the subject of any patents
 to be trade secrets.
Our brewing process is a trade secret. This process can be used to brew flavors of beverages other than ginger ale and ginger
beer
 such as root beer
 cream soda
 cola and other spice and fruit beverages. We have not sought any patents on our brewing processes
because we would be required to disclose our brewing process in patent applications.

We
generally use non-disclosure agreements with employees and distributors to protect our proprietary rights.

Government
Regulation

The
production
 distribution and sale in the United States of many of our Company&rsquo;s products are subject to the Federal Food
Drug
 and Cosmetic Act
 the Federal Trade Commission Act
 the Lanham Act
 state consumer protection laws
 federal
 state and local
workplace health and safety laws
 various federal
 state and local environmental protection laws and various other federal
 state
and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production
 transportation
 sale
 safety
 advertising
 labeling and ingredients
of such products. Outside the United States
 the distribution and sale of our many products and related operations are also subject
to numerous similar and other statutes and regulations.

A
California law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the state as having
been found to cause cancer or birth defects. The law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide
warnings on their products. This is because the law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning
is not required. Consequently
 even trace amounts of listed components can expose affected products to the prospect of warning
labels. Products containing listed substances that occur naturally or that are contributed to such products solely by a municipal
water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement. No Company beverages produced for sale in California are currently
required to display warnings under this law. We are unable to predict whether a component found in a Company product might be
added to the California list in the future
 although the state has initiated a regulatory process in which caffeine will be evaluated
for listing. Furthermore
 we are also unable to predict when or whether the increasing sensitivity of detection methodology that
may become applicable under this law and related regulations as they currently exist
 or as they may be amended
 might result
in the detection of an infinitesimal quantity of a listed substance in a beverage of ours produced for sale in California.


    
    


Bottlers
of our beverage products presently offer and use non-refillable
 recyclable containers in the United States and various other
markets around the world. Some of these bottlers also offer and use refillable containers
 which are also recyclable. Legal requirements
apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas requiring that deposits or certain taxes or fees be charged for
the sale
 marketing and use of certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures
vary. Other types of beverage container-related deposit
 recycling
 tax and/or product stewardship statutes and regulations also
apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas. We anticipate that additional
 similar legal requirements may
be proposed or enacted in the future at local
 state and federal levels
 both in the United States and elsewhere.

All
of our facilities and other operations in the United States are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations
including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater. Our policy is to comply with all such
legal requirements. Compliance with these provisions has not had
 and we do not expect such compliance to have
 any material adverse
effect on our capital expenditures
 net income or competitive position.

Environmental
Matters

Our
primary cost environmental compliance activity is in recycling fees and redemption values. We are required to collect redemption
values from our customers and remit those redemption values to the state
 based upon the number of bottles of certain products
sold in that state.



We
have 62 full-time equivalent employees on our corporate staff down from 69 in the year ending December 31
 2015. The table below
lists the departments. We employ additional people on a part-time basis as needed. We have never participated in a collective
bargaining agreement. We believe that the relationship with our employees is good.

 which serves as our principal executive offices
 our West Coast Brewery
and bottling plant and our Southern California warehouse facility. Approximately 30

Our
common stock is listed for trading on the NYSE MKT trading under the symbol &ldquo;REED&rdquo;. The following is a summary of
the high and low bid prices of our common stock on the NYSE MKT Capital Markets for the periods presented:

As
of December 31
 2016
 there were approximately 4
500 stockholders of record of the common stock (including only non-objecting
beneficial owners of record) and 13
982
230 outstanding shares of common stock.

Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities

During
the fiscal year ended December 31
 2016
 we issued the following equity securities that were unregistered under the Securities
Act:



    
We
    issued 214 shares of common stock in exchange for Reeds Board of Director services. The value of the stock was based on the
    closing price of the stock on the issuance or agreed upon date. The total value of shares issued for services was $900 the
    shares were issued pursuant to exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.


Also
during the fiscal year ended December 31
 2016
 we issued the following equity securities that were registered under the Securities
Act:

On
June 2
 2016
 pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement dated May 26
 2016 (&ldquo;Purchase Agreement&rdquo;) with institutional
and accredited investors
 Reed&rsquo;s Inc.
 a Delaware corporation (&ldquo;Reed&rsquo;s&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;)
closed a private financing transaction for the issuance and sale by Reed&rsquo;s of 692
412 shares of common stock (&ldquo;Shares&rdquo;)
and warrants to purchase 346
206 shares of common stock (&ldquo;Warrants&rdquo;)
 for gross proceeds to Reed&rsquo;s of $2
354
200.
The Offering was made solely to accredited investors (as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act of 1933
 as amended (the
&ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;)) in reliance upon the exemption from registration in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule
506 of Regulation D.

The
Company used the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes.

The
Warrants have an exercise price of $4.25 per share and a term of 5 years. The exercise price of the Warrants is subject to customary
adjustments in the event of stock dividends and splits
 and the Warrants contain protective provisions in the event of fundamental
transactions. In addition
 holders of the Warrants shall be entitled to participate in distributions
 dividends and subsequent
rights offerings to the same extent that the holders would have participated therein if the holders had held the number of shares
of common stock acquirable upon complete exercise of the Warrants. Except upon at least 61 days&rsquo; prior notice from a holder
of a Warrant to the Company
 the holder will not have the right to exercise any portion of the Warrant if the holder
 together
with its affiliates
 would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the number of shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock (including
securities convertible into common stock) outstanding immediately after the exercise.

The
Company entered in to a registration rights agreement with the investors pursuant to which it filed a resale registration statement
for the Shares and the common stock underlying the Warrants within 30 days of effective date.

Maxim
Group LLC (&ldquo;Maxim&rdquo;) acted as the placement agent for the offering under a Placement Agent Agreement
 dated May 26
2016
 between Maxim and Reed&rsquo;s (the &ldquo;Placement Agent Agreement&rdquo;). Upon the closing of the offering
 pursuant
to the Placement Agent Agreement
 Maxim received warrants to purchase up to 72
703 shares of common stock (&ldquo;Placement Agent
Warrants&rdquo;). The Placement Agent Warrants have an exercise price of $3.74 and are exercisable for a term of 5 years. The
exercise price of the Placement Agent Warrants is subject to customary adjustments in the event of stock dividends and splits
and the Placement Agent Warrants contain protective provisions in the event of fundamental transactions.

Each
of the Purchase Agreement and the Placement Agent Agreement contains customary representations
 warranties and covenants of the
parties thereto. The Company also agreed not to issue any shares of its common stock or rights to acquire shares of its common
stock for a period of 90 days from the closing of the offering
 subject to certain customary exemptions for issuances pursuant
to the Company&rsquo;s equity plans. In addition
 the Company agreed not to enter into any variable rate transactions for a period
of one year.

Dividend
Policy

We
have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings
 if any
 for use in our
business
 and
 therefore
 we do not anticipate declaring or paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Payments of future
dividends
 if any
 will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors
 including the
terms of our credit facility and our financial condition
 operating results
 current and anticipated cash needs and plans for
expansion.

We
are obligated to pay a non-cumulative 5% dividend from lawfully available assets to the holders of our Series A preferred stock
in additional shares of common stock at our discretion. In 2016 and 2015
 we paid dividends on our Series A preferred stock in
an aggregate of 1
504 and 751 shares of common stock in each such year
 respectively and anticipate that we will be obligated
to issue at least this many shares annually to the holders of the Series A preferred stock so long as such shares are issued and
outstanding.

Securities
Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans

2007
Stock Option Plan and 2015 Incentive and Non-statutory stock option plan

On
October 8
 2007
 our board of directors adopted the 2007 Stock Option Plan for 1
500
000 shares and the plan was approved by our
stockholders on November 19
 2007. All of the shares granted under our 2007 Stock Option Plan have been issued. Forfeited options
issued under the 2007 plan can be reissued prior to expiration of the plan. On April 6
 2015
 our board of directors adopted the
2015 Incentive and Non-statutory Stock Option Plan for 500
000 shares and the plan was approved by our stockholders on December
30
 2015. Forfeited options issued under the 2015 plan cannot be reissued.


    
    


The
plans permit the grant of options to our employees
 directors and consultants. The options may constitute either &ldquo;incentive
stock options&rdquo; within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code or &ldquo;non-qualified stock options&rdquo;.
The primary difference between &ldquo;incentive stock options&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-qualified stock options&rdquo; is that once
an option is exercised
 the stock received under an &ldquo;incentive stock option&rdquo; has the potential of being taxed at the
more favorable long-term capital gains rate
 while stock received by exercising a &ldquo;non-qualified stock option&rdquo; is
taxed according to the ordinary income tax rate schedule.

The
plans are currently administered by the board of directors. The plan administrator has full and final authority to select the
individuals to receive options and to grant such options as well as a wide degree of flexibility in determining the terms and
conditions of options
 including vesting provisions.

The
exercise price of an option granted under the plan cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value per share of common stock
on the date of the grant of the option. The exercise price of an incentive stock option granted to a person owning more than 10%
of the total combined voting power of the common stock must be at least 110% of the fair market value per share of common stock
on the date of the grant. Options may not be granted under the plan on or after the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the plan.
Incentive stock options granted to a person owning more than 10% of the combined voting power of the common stock cannot be exercisable
for more than five years.

When
an option is exercised
 the purchase price of the underlying stock will be paid in cash
 except that the plan administrator may
permit the exercise price to be paid in any combination of cash
 shares of stock having a fair market value equal to the exercise
price
 or as otherwise determined by the plan administrator.

If
an optionee ceases to be an employee
 director
 or consultant with us
 other than by reason of death
 disability or retirement
all vested options must be exercised within three months following such event. However
 if an optionee&rsquo;s employment or consulting
relationship with us terminates for cause
 or if a director of ours is removed for cause
 all unexercised options will terminate
immediately. If an optionee ceases to be an employee or director of
 or a consultant to us
 by reason of death
 disability
 or
retirement
 all vested options may be exercised within one year following such event or such shorter period as is otherwise provided
in the related agreement.

For
the 2007 plan
 when a stock award expires or is terminated before it is exercised
 the shares set aside for that award are returned
to the pool of shares available for future awards. For the 2015 plan
 when a stock award expires or is terminated before it is
exercised
 the shares are canceled and cannot be reissued.

No
option can be granted under the plan after ten years following the earlier of the date the plan was adopted by the board of directors
or the date the plan was approved by our stockholders.

(a)
Gross sales is used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance
 including sales performance
of particular products
 salesperson performance
 product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross
sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items
 which can mask certain performance issues.
We therefore believe that the presentation of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. Gross sales
is not a measure that is recognized under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles &ldquo;GAAP&rdquo; and should not be considered
as an alternative to net sales
 which is determined in accordance with GAAP
 and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating
performance in place of net sales. Additionally
 gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other
companies
 as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition
 gross sales may not be realized in
the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers.


    
    


(b)
Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements
 the disclosure
thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally
 our definition of promotional and other allowances
may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration
given to the Company&rsquo;s distributors or retail customers including
 but not limited to the following: (i) reimbursements
given to the Company&rsquo;s distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers
 including slotting
 shelf
space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (ii) the Company&rsquo;s agreed share of fees given to distributors
and/or directly to retailers for in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iii) the Company&rsquo;s agreed share of slotting
shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers; (iv) incentives given to the Company&rsquo;s distributors and/or
retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; and (v) discounted or free products. The presentation
of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending
levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing
activities. The Company&rsquo;s promotional allowance programs with its numerous distributors and/or retailers are executed through
separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements
described above and are of varying durations
 ranging from one week to one year.

(c)
Cost of tangible goods sold consists of the costs of raw materials and packaging utilized in the manufacture of products
 co-packing
fees
 repacking fees
 in-bound freight charges
 inventory adjustments
 as well as certain internal transfer costs. Cost of tangible
goods sold is used internally by management to measure the direct costs of goods sold
 aside from unallocated plant costs. Cost
of tangible goods sold is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cost of
goods sold
 which is determined in accordance with GAAP
 and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance
in place of cost of goods sold.

(d)
Cost of goods sold &ndash; idle capacity consists of direct production costs in excess of charges allocated to our finished goods
in production. Plant costs include labor costs
 production supplies
 repairs and maintenance
 and inventory write-off. Our charges
for labor and overhead allocated to our finished goods are determined on a market cost basis
 which is lower than our actual costs
incurred. Plant costs in excess of production allocations are expensed in the period incurred rather than added to the cost of
finished goods produced. Cost goods sold &ndash; idle capacity is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be
considered as an alternative to cost of goods sold
 which is determined in accordance with GAAP
 and should not be used alone
as an indicator of operating performance in place of cost of goods sold.


    
    


Year
ended December 31
 2016 Compared to Year ended December 31
 2015

Gross
Sales

Gross
sales for all of Reeds products decreased 7% to $46
198
000 for the year ended December 31
 2016 from $49
713
000 in the prior
year.

Sales
Volume Eight Ounce Equivalents - 
increased 0.5%
 Reed&rsquo;s variety beverages led by Flying Cauldron was up 4.4% and net private label beverages were up 0.5%.
Virgils decreased 10.4% and Reed&rsquo;s Kombucha decreased 54.3%.

Gross
Sales Dollars Eight Ounce Equivalents -
beverages increased 1.9%
 Reed&rsquo;s variety beverages led by Flying Cauldron were up 4.1% and net private label beverages was
up 3.6%. Virgils decreased 9.8% and Reed&rsquo;s Kombucha decreased 53.8%. On an eight-ounce serving size
 gross sales were unchanged
at $12.16 per eight-ounce case.

Sales
are down an average of 9% in all selling channels. All customers representing at least one percent of sales in 2015
were still customers in 2016. We believe that the decline in all channels was due to consumer
preferences away from all sugar sodas including our natural based sugars. In response to the general consumer trend
 the Company&rsquo;s
research and development efforts have focused on all natural alternatives that have 12 calories per 12 ounce serving. We are in
tests in the market place and expect to have these offerings available in the marketplace in the second half of this year.

Gross
sales of items such as candy
 ingredients
 packaging and mail order are not included in the discussion above. These items as a
group totaled $1
684
000 in gross sales
 a decrease of $743
000 or 31% over 2015. The decrease in candy was $597
000 and was the
direct result of a California lawsuit that has required the Company to find reliable alternative suppliers.

Promotional
and other allowances

Promotions
and allowances for beverage products decreased in dollars 1% to $3
726
000 (8.1% of gross sales) for the year ended December 31
2016 from $3
765
000 (7.6% of gross sales) in the prior year.

The
promotional discounts on eight-ounce equivalent increased 4.1% or $0.04/case to $1.02/case from $0.98/case in 2015. This increase
is primarily attributable to an increase in the promotional programs and discounts offered in the fourth quarter of 2016 over
a lower sales volume.

Net
Sales

Net
sales of all items decreased 7.6% or $3
476
000 to $42
472
000 for the year ended December 31
 2016 from $45
948
000 in the prior
year.

For
beverage products
 net sales by 8oz case equivalents decreased in 2016 by 2.7% to $11.60/case from $11.92/case from the prior
year.

Cost
of Goods Sold

Cost
of goods sold consists of the costs of raw materials and packaging utilized in the manufacture of products
 co-packing fees
 repacking
fees
 in-bound freight charges
 inventory adjustments
 as well as certain internal transfer costs. Cost of goods sold also consists
of direct production costs in excess of charges allocated to our finished goods in production. Plant costs include labor costs
production supplies
 and repairs and maintenance. Our charges for labor and overhead allocated to our finished goods are determined
on a market cost basis
 which is lower than our actual costs incurred. Plant costs in excess of production allocations are expensed
in the period incurred rather than added to the cost of finished goods produced.

Total
cost of goods sold decreased to $33
490
000 in the year ended December 31
 2016
 a decrease of $853
000 or 2.5% from 2015. The
decrease was due to net volume decrease of 7.6% and increases in cost of production. Had total cost of goods decreased at a rate
equal to the volume decrease of 7.6%
 total cost of goods would have decreased a total of $3
228
000. The company incurred an
additional $2
376
000 in the rate of cost of goods sold.

Specific
production costs that comprised the additional $2
376
000 or $0.65 eight-ounce case was comprised of direct write off of inventories
of $705
000 or $0.19/eight-once case
 packaging cost increases of $1
208
000 or $0.33/eight-ounce case and ingredient cost increases
of 842
000 or $0.23/eight-ounce case. These increases were partially offset by labor productivity decreases of $183
000 or $0.05/eight-ounce
case and a decrease in the reserve for obsolescence by $175
000 over 2015 or $0.05/eight-ounce case.17

Gross
Profit

Our
gross profit of $8
982
000 in the year ended December 31
 2016 represents a decrease of $2
623
000
 or 22.6% from 2015. As a percentage
of sales
 our gross profit decreased to 21.1% in 2016 as compared to 25.3% in 2015. As noted above
 the gross profit is the result
of a decrease in net selling price of 4.1% and an increase cost of goods sold of 7.1%.

The
Company has in place for the first quarter of 2017 cost cutting initiatives related to ingredient usage and package pricing that
are on track to drive over 200 basis point improvement for the full year. In addition
 the Company LA plant is scheduled for production
in May that will enable the Company to realize an overdue savings of an additional 350 basis points on an annualized basis from
that initiative. We believe that since these initiatives are under our control
 the savings will be realized in 2017.


    
    



Delivery
and Handling Expenses

Delivery
and handling expenses consist of delivery costs to customers and warehouse costs incurred for handling our finished goods after
production. Delivery and handling costs decreased to $3
902
000 in the year ended December 31
 2016 compared to $5
100
000 in
2015. The $1
198
000 (23%) decrease is due to lower volume but higher full truck quantities. Current rates of 9% are comparable
to historic rates. The Company expects costs to decrease further when the L.A. Brewery upgrade is finalized.

Selling
and marketing expenses

Selling
and marketing expenses consist primarily of three categories; direct charges for staff compensation costs in sales labor
 sales
operations consisting of travel and entertainment
 office rent and communications and sales support consisting primarily of brokers
fees
 advertising and consultants. Selling and marketing costs for 2016 were $3
701
000 or a decrease of 24% when compared to
$4
867
000 in 2015.

The
decrease of $1
166
000 is the result of decreases in sales labor costs of $461
000
 sales operations of $188
000 and sales support
of $517
000.

Our
sales staff decreased to 16 full time equivalents (FTE&rsquo;s) employees at December 31
 2016
 from 17 FTE&rsquo;s at December
31
 2015.

General
and Administrative Expenses

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of three categories; direct charges for staff compensation costs in office and general
management
 General and administrative operations consisting of office rent
 facility depreciation
 utilities
 General and administrative
support in information
 SEC filings
 shareholder meetings
 legal and audit and finally; miscellaneous expenses such as amortization
of intangibles and bad debt expense. General and administrative costs for 2016 were $4
208
000 or a decrease of
4% when compared to $4
368
000 in 2015.

The
total decrease of $160
000 is due to a decrease in administrative wage related expenses of $257
000
 a decrease
of administrative operations of $154
000
 an increase administrative support expenses of $251
000. Impairment loss
of $224
000 driven by the China Cola brand impairment.

The
General management and administrative staff decreased to 13 FTE&rsquo;s at December 31
 2016
 from 15 at December 31
 2015.

Loss
from Operations

Loss
from operations was $3
053
000 in the year ended December 31
 2016
 as compared to loss from operations of $2
730
000 in 2015
or an increase of $323
000. The increase in the operating loss is due to the decline in sales that were not offset by similar
reduction in cost of goods sold that resulted in a lower gross profit of $2
623
000. The lower gross profit was mirrored by a
similar decrease in expenses of $2
300
000.

Interest
Expense

Interest
expense increased to $1
724
000 in the year ended December 31
 2016
 compared to interest expense of $1
231
000 in the same period
of 2015. During 2016 and 2015 the Company&rsquo;s losses incurred liquidity shortages that required a an infusion of capital.
A total of $3
000
000 was obtained that also changed the terms of the existing line of credit and CAPEX loan. As the plant approached
completion
 further borrowing was obtained to complete the plant. As a direct consequence of the term change and the additional
borrowing
 the Company&rsquo;s net interest charge increased.


    
    


Modified
EBITDA

The
Company defines modified EBITDA (a non-GAAP measurement) as net income (loss) before interest
 taxes
 depreciation and amortization
impairment charges
 non-cash share-based compensation and warrant liability expenses. Other companies may
calculate modified EBITDA differently. Management believes that the presentation of modified EBITDA provides a measure of performance
that approximates cash flow before interest expense
 and is meaningful to investors.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

As
of December 31
 2016
 we had stockholder&rsquo;s deficit of $1
657
000 and working capital deficit of $1
563
000
 compared
to stockholder&rsquo;s equity of $785
000 and working capital of $730
000 at December 31
 2015. The decrease in our working capital
of $2
293
000 was primarily a result of cash flow from operations.

Our
decrease in cash and cash equivalents to $451
000 at December 31
 2016 compared to $1
816
000 at December 31
 2015
 a decrease
of $1
365
000 was primarily a result of cash generated by financing activities of $1
578
000 less cash used for costs of
plant improvements of $410
000 and use of cash for operations of $2
533
000.

On
September 1
 2015 Reed&rsquo;s Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) entered into an additional Term Loan (Term Loan B) with a principal
balance of $1
500
000 at prime plus 11.60% (currently 14.85%) with PMC Financial Services Group
 LLC.

Concurrently
the conditions for a rate change involving Term Loan A of $1
500
000 from December 5
 2014 have been modified. The payment terms
have not been modified. Under the new conditions
 the rate charge will be calculated on a sliding scale based on the trailing
6 month EBITDA. If the EBITDA measuring point stays below $1
000
000 where it was at the time of financing
 the rate would rise
to 12% from the current rate of 9%. If EBITDA rises to $1
500
000 then the rate will remain at 9%.

Notwithstanding
the other borrowing terms above
 if Excess Borrowing Availability under the $6 million Revolving working capital loan remains
more than $1
500
000 at all times during the preceding month (currently Reed&rsquo;s Borrowing Availability is zero) the Interest
Rate shall remain unchanged for the asset based lending that includes the Revolving working capital loan
 CAPEX capital improvement
loan and Term Loan A. The six month Term Loan B rates are to remain the same at 14.85%.



    
    


For
the year ended December 31
 2016
 the Company recorded a net loss of $5
009
000 and utilized cash in operations of $2
533
000.
During 2015
 the company experienced a major disruption in our east coast production facilities. By October of 2015
 the Company
had qualified another two co-packers for a total of three co-packers enabling the Company to avoid supply chain interruptions
in 2016. We believe that if this disruption had not occurred
 the Company would have been able to fill purchase orders and avoid
the additional costs related to delivery and raw materials in 2015. The Company&rsquo;s ability to reclaim the lost shelf space
continued in 2016. This remains the Company&rsquo;s main focus.

As
of March 31
 2017
 the Company had a cash balance of $197
000 and had available borrowing on our existing line of credit of $191
000.
On April 24
 2017
 the Company issued a convertible note resulting in net proceeds of $3
240
000. Furthermore
 during the year
ended December 31
 2016
 we were able to extend the maturity date of our operating line of credit and our other bank loans through
October 21
 2018.

We
believe that the Company currently has the necessary working capital to support existing operations for at least the next 12 months.
Our primary capital source will be positive cash flow from operations. If our sales goals do not materialize as planned
 we believe
that the Company can reduce its operating costs and can be managed to maintain positive cash flow from operations. Historically
we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of common stock
 preferred stock
 convertible debt
 a line of
credit from a financial institution and cash generated from operations.

We
may not generate sufficient revenues from product sales in the future to achieve profitable operations. If we are not able to
achieve profitable operations at some point in the future
 we eventually may have insufficient working capital to maintain our
operations as we presently intend to conduct them or to fund our expansion and marketing and product development plans. In addition
our losses may increase in the future as we expand our manufacturing capabilities and fund our marketing plans and product development.
These losses
 among other things
 have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our working capital
 total assets and
stockholders&rsquo; equity. If we are unable to achieve profitability
 the market value of our common stock would decline and
there would be a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

If
we suffer losses from operations
 our working capital may be insufficient to support our ability to expand our business operations
as rapidly as we would deem necessary at any time
 unless we are able to obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms
 or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available
on acceptable terms
 we may not be able to pursue our business objectives and would be required to reduce our level of operations
including reducing infrastructure
 promotions
 personnel and other operating expenses. These events could adversely affect our
business
 results of operations and financial condition. If adequate funds are not available or if they are not available on acceptable
terms
 our ability to fund the growth of our operations
 take advantage of opportunities
 develop products or services or otherwise
respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our
financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
or GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our financial statements including
various allowances and reserves for accounts receivable and inventories
 the estimated lives of long-lived assets and trademarks
and trademark licenses
 as well as claims and contingencies arising out of litigation or other transactions that occur in the
normal course of business. The following summarize our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices:

Revenue
Recognition
 and collection
of the receivable is reasonably assured
 which generally occurs when the product is shipped. A product is not shipped without
an order from the customer and credit acceptance procedures performed. The allowance for returns is regularly reviewed and adjusted
by management based on historical trends of returned items. Amounts paid by customers for shipping and handling costs are included
in sales. The Company reimburses its wholesalers and retailers for promotional discounts
 samples and certain advertising and
promotional activities used in the promotion of the Company&rsquo;s products. The accounting treatment for the reimbursements
for samples and discounts to wholesalers results in a reduction in the net revenue line item. Reimbursements to wholesalers and
retailers for certain advertising activities are included in selling and marketing expenses.



    
    


Long-Lived
Assets
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment
 management prepares an estimate of future
cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying
amount of the asset
 an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. For the years ended
December 31
 2016 the Company recognized a charge of $268
000 for impairments for its property and equipment in anticipation of
early retirement of equipment with the Los Angeles plant. There were no charges for equipment impairment prior to that in the
prior years.

Intangible
assets
that these brand names will contribute cash flows to the Company perpetually. These indefinite-lived intangible assets are not
amortized
 but are assessed for impairment annually and evaluated annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life is
appropriate. As part of our impairment test
 we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not
that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If further testing is necessary
 we compare the estimated fair value of
our indefinite-lived intangible asset with its book value. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds
its fair value
 as determined by its discounted cash flows
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
For the year ended December 31
 2016 the Company recognized a $224
000 impairment charge related to its China Cola brand. For
the year ended December 31
 2015
 the Company did not recognize any impairment charges for its indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Management
believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of our long lived assets
 including our trademark license and trademarks
is a &ldquo;critical accounting estimate&rdquo; because: (1) it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because
it requires management to estimate fair value
 which is based on assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the
impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet
 as well as net income
 could be
material. Management&rsquo;s assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues
and expenses have fluctuated in the past and we expect they will continue to do so.

In
estimating future revenues
 we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data for existing
product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows.

Accounts
Receivable
where we become aware of a specific customer&rsquo;s inability to meet its financial obligations to us
 a specific reserve for
bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount our management believes will
ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts
 bad debt charges are recorded
based on our historical losses and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding.

.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value
of the inventory. We regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory
based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and/or our ability to sell the product(s) concerned and production
requirements. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for our products include unanticipated
changes in consumer preferences
 general market conditions or other factors
 which may result in cancellations of advance orders
or a reduction in the rate of reorders placed by customers. Additionally
 our management&rsquo;s estimates of future product demand
may be inaccurate
 which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory.

Stock-Based
Compensation. 
transactions for services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting
to employees based on the authoritative guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) whereas the value
of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized as compensation on the straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative
guidance of the FASB whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a)
the date at which a performance commitment is reached
 or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity
instruments is complete. Options granted to non-employees are revalued each reporting period to determine the amount to be recorded
as an expense in the respective period. As the options vest
 they are valued on each vesting date and an adjustment is recorded
for the difference between the value already recorded and the then current value on the date of vesting. In certain circumstances
where there are no future performance requirements by the non-employee
 option grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based
compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date.

The
fair value of the Company&rsquo;s stock option and warrant grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing
model
 which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free interest rates
 expected volatility
 expected life of the stock options
or warrants
 and future dividends. Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes Option
Pricing model
 and based on actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could materially
affect compensation expense recorded in future periods.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Reed&rsquo;s
Inc.

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Reed&rsquo;s
 Inc. as of December 31
 2016 and 2015
 and the related statements
of operations
 changes in stockholders&rsquo; equity (deficit)
 and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis
for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An
audit includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
 assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion
 the financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects

REED&rsquo;S
INC.
NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR

 2016 AND 2015



    
Operations
    and Liquidity




    
Nature
    of Operations


Reed&rsquo;s
Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) was organized under the laws of the state of Florida in January 1991. In 2001
 the Company changed
its name from Original Beverage Corporation to Reed&rsquo;s
 Inc. and changed its state of incorporation from Florida to Delaware.
The Company is engaged primarily in the business of developing
 manufacturing and marketing natural non-alcoholic beverages
 as
well as candies and ice creams. We currently manufacture
 market and sell seven unique product lines:



    
Reed&rsquo;s
    Ginger Brews


    
    

    
Virgil&rsquo;s
    Root Beer
 Cream Sodas
 Dr. Better and Real Cola
 including ZERO diet sodas


    
    

    
Culture
    Club Kombucha


    
    

    
China
    Colas


    
    

    
Reed&rsquo;s
    Ginger candy and ice creams
 

    
    

    
Sonoma
    Sparkler and other juice based products.


The
Company sells its products primarily in natural food stores
 supermarket chains
 and upscale gourmet stores in the United States
and Canada.



    
Cash
    and Liquidity


The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern. Such
assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the year
ended December 31
 2016 the Company recorded a net loss of $ 5
009
000 and utilized cash in operations of $2
533
000. As of December
31
 2016
 we had a working capital deficiency of $1
563
000 and a stockholders&rsquo; deficit of $1
657
000.

As
of March 31
 2017
 the Company had a cash balance of $197
000 and had available borrowing on our existing line of credit of $191
000.
On April 21
 2017
 the Company issued a convertible note resulting in net proceeds of $3
240
000. Furthermore
during the year ended December 31
 2016
 we were able to extend the maturity date of our operating line of credit and our other
bank loans through October 21
 2018. We estimate the Company currently has sufficient cash and liquidity to meet its anticipated
working capital for the next twelve months.

Historically
we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of common stock
 preferred stock
 a line of credit from a financial
institution and cash generated from operations. We anticipate that our primary capital source will be positive cash flow from
operations. If our sales goals do not materialize as planned
 we believe that the Company can reduce its operating costs and achieve
positive cash flow from operations. However
 we may not generate sufficient revenues from product sales in the future to achieve
profitable operations. If we are not able to achieve profitable operations at some point in the future
 we may have insufficient
working capital to maintain our operations as we presently intend to conduct them or to fund our expansion
 marketing
 and product
development plans. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms
 or at all.


    
    




    
Significant
    Accounting Policies




    
Use
    of Estimates


The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Those estimates and assumptions include estimates for reserves of uncollectible accounts
inventory obsolescence
 depreciable lives of property and equipment
 analysis of impairments of recorded long term assets and
intangibles
 accruals for potential liabilities and assumptions made in valuing stock instruments issued for services.



    
Accounts
    Receivable


The
Company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the
Company becomes aware of a specific customer&rsquo;s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company
 a specific reserve
for bad debts is estimated and recorded
 which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes
will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts
 bad debt charges are recorded
based on the Company&rsquo;s historical losses and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding.

The
allowance for doubtful accounts and returns and discounts is established through a provision reducing the carrying value of receivables.
At December 31
 2016 and 2015
 the allowance for doubtful accounts and returns and discounts was approximately $256
000 and $356
000
respectively.



    
    


Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory.
We regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily
on our estimated forecast of product demand and/or our ability to sell the product(s) concerned and production requirements. Demand
for our products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for our products include unanticipated changes
in consumer preferences
 general market conditions or other factors
 which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a
reduction in the rate of reorders placed by customers. Additionally
 our management&rsquo;s estimates of future product demand
may be inaccurate
 which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory.



    
Property
    and Equipment and Related Depreciation


Property
and equipment is stated at cost. Expenditures for major renewals and improvements that extend the useful lives of property and
equipment or increase production capacity are capitalized
 and expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense
as incurred. Depreciation is calculated using accelerated and straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets
as follows:



Property
    and Equipment Type
    
Years
    of Depreciation 
    

    
    
39
    years
    

Machinery
    and equipment
    
5-12
    years
    

    
    
5
    years
    

Office
    equipment
    
5-7
    years
    


Management
assesses the carrying value of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment
 management prepares an estimate of future cash flows expected to
result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset
an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. For the years ended December 31
 2016 the
Company recognized a charge of $260
000 for impairments for its property and equipment in anticipation of early retirement of
equipment with the Los Angeles plant. There were no charges for equipment impairment prior to that in the prior years.


    
    





    
Intangible
    Assets and Impairment Policy


Intangible
assets are comprised of indefinite-lived brand names acquired and have been assigned an indefinite life as we currently anticipate
that these brand names will contribute cash flows to the Company perpetually. These indefinite-lived intangible assets are not
amortized
 but are assessed for impairment annually and evaluated annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life is
appropriate. As part of our impairment test
 we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not
that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If further testing is necessary
 we compare the estimated fair value of
our indefinite-lived intangible asset with its book value. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds
its fair value
 as determined by its discounted cash flows
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
For the years ended December 31
 2016 the Company recognized an impairment charge of $224
000 for the China Cola brand. For 2015
the Company did not recognize any impairment charges for its indefinite-lived intangible assets.



    
    


The
Company&rsquo;s cash balances on deposit with banks are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250
000
at December 31
 2016. The Company may be exposed to risk for the amounts of funds held in bank accounts more than the insurance
limit. In assessing the risk
 the Company&rsquo;s policy is to maintain cash balances with high quality financial institutions.
The Company had cash balances more than the guarantee during the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015.

During
the year ended December 31
 2016
 the Company had two customers who accounted for approximately 22% and 12% of its sales
 respectively;
and during the year ended December 31
 2015
 the Company had two customers who accounted for approximately 28% and 14% of its
sales
 respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of sales in either year. As of December 31
 2016
 the Company
had accounts receivable due from one customer who comprised $719
000 (25%) of its total accounts receivable; and as of December
31
 2015
 the Company had accounts receivable due from two customers who comprised $782
000 (24%) and $373
000 (12%)
 respectively
of its total accounts receivable. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable in either year.

During
the year ended December 31
 2016
 the Company had utilized three separate co-pack packers for most its production and bottling
of beverage products in the Eastern United States. Although there are other packers and the Company has outfitted our own brewery
and bottling plant
 a change in packers may cause a delay in the production process
 which could ultimately affect operating results.

During
the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015
 the Company had one vendor which accounted for approximately 26% and 25%
 respectively
of purchases. At December 31
 2016 and 2015
 the Company had accounts payable due to two vendors who comprised 13% and 10% for
the year ended December 31
 2016
 and 14% and 12% of its total accounts payable
 for the year ended December 31
 2015. No other
account was more than 10% of the balance of accounts payable as of December 31
 2016
 and December 31
 2015.



    
Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments


The
Company uses various inputs in determining the fair value of its investments and measures these assets on a recurring basis. Financial
assets recorded at fair value in the balance sheets are categorized by the level of objectivity associated with the inputs used
to measure their fair value. Authoritative guidance provided by the FASB defines the following levels directly related to the
amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these financial assets:

Level
1&mdash;Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level
2&mdash;Inputs
 other than the quoted prices in active markets
 that are observable either directly or indirectly.

Level
3&mdash;Unobservable inputs based on the Company&rsquo;s assumptions.

The
carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities
 such as cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 short-term bank
loans
 accounts payable
 notes payable and other payables
 approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these
instruments. The carrying values of capital lease obligations and long-term financing obligations approximate their fair values
since the interest rates on these obligations are based on prevailing market interest rates.

The
fair value of the warrant liability of $775
000 at December 31
 2016 was valued using Level 2 inputs.


    
    




    
Cost
    of sales


Cost
of goods sold is comprised of the costs of raw materials and packaging utilized in the manufacture of products
 co-packing fees
repacking fees
 in-bound freight charges
 as well as certain internal transfer costs. Additionally
 cost of goods sold consists
of direct production costs in excess of charges allocated to finished goods in production. Plant costs include labor costs
 production
supplies
 repairs and maintenance
 direct inventory write-off charges and adjustments to the inventory reserve. Charges for labor
and overhead allocated to finished goods are determined on a market cost basis
 which may be lower than the actual costs incurred.
Plant costs in excess of production allocations are expensed in the period incurred rather than added to the cost of finished
goods produced. Expenses not related to the production of our products are classified as operating expenses.



    
Delivery
    and Handling Expenses


Shipping
and handling costs are comprised of purchasing and receiving costs
 inspection costs
 warehousing costs
 transfer freight costs
and other costs associated with product distribution after manufacture and are included as part of operating expenses.



    
Income
    Taxes


The
Company uses an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes that allows recognition and
measurement of deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and
liability approach
 deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance
is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before the Company is able to
realize their benefits
 or that future deductibility is uncertain. The Company&rsquo;s policy is to recognize interest and/or
penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.



    
Revenue
    Recognition


Revenue
is recognized on the sale of a product when the risk of loss transfers to our customers
 and collection of the receivable is reasonably
assured
 which generally occurs when the product is shipped. A product is not shipped without an order from the customer and credit
acceptance procedures performed. The allowance for returns is regularly reviewed and adjusted by management based on historical
trends of returned items. Amounts paid by customers for shipping and handling costs are included in sales.

The
Company accounts for certain sales incentives for customers
 including slotting fees
 as a reduction of gross sales. These sales
incentives for the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015 were approximately $3
726
000 and $3
765
000
 respectively.



    
Net
    Loss Per Share


Basic
earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) applicable to Common Stockholders by the weighted average
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net
income (loss) applicable to Common Stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of
additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all dilutive potential common shares had been issued
 using the treasury
stock method. Potential common shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is antidilutive.

For
the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015
 the calculations of basic and diluted loss per share are the same because potential
dilutive securities would have an anti-dilutive effect. The potentially dilutive securities consisted of the following as of:

    Costs

costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling expense in the amount of $254
000 and $105
000
 for the years ended
December 31
 2016 and 2015
 respectively.



    
Stock
    Compensation Expense


The
Company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for
services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based
on the authoritative guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) whereas the value of the award is measured
on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense on the straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company accounts
for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the FASB
whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a
performance commitment is reached
 or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete.
Options granted to non-employees are revalued each reporting period to determine the amount to be recorded as an expense in the
respective period. As the options vest
 they are valued on each vesting date and an adjustment is recorded for the difference
between the value already recorded and the then current value on the date of vesting. In certain circumstances where there are
no future performance requirements by the non-employee
 option grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based compensation
charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date.

The
fair value of the Company&rsquo;s stock option and warrant grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing
model
 which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free interest rates
 expected volatility
 expected life of the stock options
or warrants
 and future dividends. Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton
Option Pricing model
 and based on actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could
materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods.

 the Company has reclassified these expenses to interest expense.



    
Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements 


In
May 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts
with Customers. ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition
guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. Under ASU
2014-09
 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that
reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition
 the standard
requires disclosure of the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
The FASB has recently issued ASU 2016-08
 ASU 2016-10
 ASU 2016-11
 ASU 2016-12
 and ASU 2016-20 all of which clarify certain
implementation guidance within ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15
2017. Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods
therein. The standard can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method)
or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application
(the cumulative catch-up transition method). The Company is currently in the process of analyzing the information necessary to
determine the impact of adopting this new guidance on its financial position
 results of operations
 and cash flows. The Company
will adopt the provisions of this statement in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.

In
February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a corresponding
lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for all interim
and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective transition
approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the beginning of the earliest
period presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the expected impact that the standard could
have on its financial statements and related disclosures.

In
March 2016
 the FASB issued the ASU 2016-09
 Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting. The amendments in this ASU require
 among other things
 that all income tax effects of awards be recognized
in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. The ASU also allows for an employer to repurchase more of an employee&rsquo;s
shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and allows for a policy election
to account for forfeitures as they occur. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
2016
 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual
period. The Company is currently evaluating the expected impact that the standard could have on its financial statements and related
disclosures.

Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB
 including its Emerging Issues Task Force
 the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants
 and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact
on the Company&rsquo;s present or future consolidated financial statements.

Notes
    Payable



The
Company has a Loan and Security Agreement with PMC Financial Services Group
 LLC (PMC) that provides a $6
000
000 revolving line
of credit
 a $3
000
000 term loan
 and a Capital Expansion loan up to $4
700
000. The loans are secured by substantially all the
assets of the Company and become due on January 1
 2019. The notes are as follows:

Revolving
Line of Credit

The
agreement provides a $6
000
000 revolving line of credit. At December 31
 2016 and 2015
 the aggregate amount outstanding under
the line of credit was $4
384
000 and$4
443
000
 respectively.

The
interest rate on the Revolving Loan was the prime rate plus .35% but was modified on December 7
 2016
such that the rate charge will be calculated on a sliding scale based on the trailing 6 month Earnings Before Interest Taxes and
Depreciation (&ldquo;EBITDA&rdquo;). If the EBITDA measuring point stays below $1
000
000 where it is now
 the rate will rise
to 12% from the current rate of 9%. If EBITDA rises to $1
500
000 then the rate will be reduced to 9%. As of December 31
 2016
our effective rate under the revolving line was 9.5%. The monthly management fee is .45% of the average monthly loan balance.

The
revolving line of credit is based on 85% of accounts receivable and 60% of eligible inventory and is secured by substantially
all of the Company&rsquo;s assets. As of December 31
 2016
 the Company had no borrowing availability under the line of credit
agreement

On
April 25
 2016
 the Company agreed with PMC to amend the definition of eligible inventory to include certain glass containers
in exchange for 10
000 warrants. The total value of the line did not increase and the inclusion of the glass as defined under
the amendment expired December 31
 2016. In connection with the agreement
 the Company granted PMC 10
000 warrants at an exercise
price of $3.90 per share with a term of five years and six months. The 10
000 warrants were valued at $15
000 using the Black
Scholes Merton option pricing model and were recorded as a valuation discount. The following assumptions were made in valuing
the 10
000 warrants; term of 5.5 years
 volatility of 56.35%
 expected dividends of 0% and discount rate of 1.50%. The value of
the warrants was recorded as a valuation discount at issuance and was fully amortized to interest expense during the year ended
December 31
 2016.

The
line of credit matures on January 1
 2019 and is subject to a 1% prepayment penalty for prepayment prior to the first anniversary
of the effective date.

Term
    Loans


In
connection with the Loan and Security Agreement with PMC
 the Company entered into two Term Loans of $1
500
000 each
 for an aggregate
borrowing of $3
000
000. The term loans are secured by all of the unencumbered assets of the Company and are due on January 1
2019. The annual interest rate on the first loan was prime plus 5.75% (currently 9.5%)
 and the rate on the second loan was prime
plus 11.60% (currently 14.85%) but was modified on December 7
 2016 such that the new rate will be based on the trailing 6 month
EBITDA. If the EBITDA measuring point stays below $1
000
000 where it is now
 the rate will rise to 12% from the current rate
of 9%. If EBITDA rises to $1
500
000 then the rate will be reduced to 9%. As of December 31
 2016
 and 2015
 the amount outstanding
was $3
000
000 and $3
000
000 respectively.



    
Capital
    Expansion (&ldquo;CAPEX&rdquo;) Loan


In
connection with the Loan and Security Agreement with PMC
 the Company entered into a Capital expansion loan which
 after amendment
allows a total borrowing of $4
700
000. The loans are secured by all of the property and equipment purchased under the loan. The
interest rate on the CAPEX loan is the prime rate plus 5.75% (9.5% at December 31
 2016). Interest only is payable on CAPEX Loans
through January 31
 2017
 at which time principal and interest will be aggregated and repaid in equal monthly payments of principal
and interest based on 48 month amortization. Currently
 the estimated amount that will become due in a year is $953
000.
At December 31
 2016 and 2015
 the balance on the CAPEX loan balance was $3
950
000 and $1
883
000 respectively
 and as of December
31
 2016
 the Company had future borrowing availability of $750
000.

In
addition
 Reed&rsquo;s agreed to pre-pay the CAPEX Loan by at least $300
000 from the proceeds of the sale of idle equipment
if such sale were to occur.

In
conjunction with this loan the Company placed equipment with a cost of $250
000 at a co-packing facility to enable the co-packer
to manufacture our products. Should the Company be unable to secure access to the equipment in the event of failure of the co-packer
the amount will become due and payable by the Company immediately.


    
    




    
Issuance
    of Warrants upon Amendments


On
November 9
 2015
 as part of restructuring of the Term Loans with PMC
 the Company granted PMC 125
000 warrants at an exercise
price of $4.50 per share for five years and six months. The 125
000 warrants were valued at $141
000 using the Black Scholes Merton
option pricing model and were recorded as a valuation discount. The following assumptions were made in valuing the 125
000 warrants;
term of 5.5 years
 volatility of 56.04%
 expected dividends 0% and discount rate of 0.68%. The value of the warrants of $141
000
was recorded as a valuation discount and is being amortized over the remaining 16 months of the term loans.

On
May 13
 2016
 as part of a further restructuring of the loans with PMC
 the Company granted PMC 50
000 warrants at an exercise
price of $4.50 per share with a term of five years and six months. The 50
000 warrants were valued at $38
000 using the Black
Scholes Merton option pricing model and were recorded as a valuation discount. The following assumptions were made in valuing
the 50
000 warrants; term of 5.5 years
 volatility of 54.17%
 expected dividends of 0% and discount rate of 1.49%. The value of
the warrants of $38
000 was recorded as a valuation discount and is being amortized over the remaining term of the loans.

On
December 7
 2016
 the Company agreed to reprice the exercise price of 50
000 common stock purchase warrants granted under Amendment
Twelve from $4.50 to $4.10 and to reprice the exercise price of 125
000 common stock purchase warrants granted under Amendment
Ten from $5.01 to $4.10. The following assumptions were made in repricing the warrants; term of 3.5 years
 volatility of 49.52%
expected dividends 0% and discount rate of 0.74%. The incremental value of the warrants before and after the modification of $38
000
will be amortized over the remaining 24 months of the term loans. Reed&rsquo;s also agreed to pay a one-time fee of $35
000.

During
the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015 amortization of the discount was $130
000 and $9
000 respectively
 and the unamortized
discount was $78
000 and $132
000 as of December 31
 2016 and 2015
 respectively.



    
    


Notwithstanding
the other borrowing terms above
 if Excess Borrowing Availability under the $6 million Revolving line of credit remains more than
$1
500
000 at all times during the preceding month (currently Reed&rsquo;s Borrowing Availability is zero) the additional interest
rate for all loans will be eliminated. The following chart summarizes the loans as of December 31
 2016

On
June 15
 2009
 the Company closed escrow on the sale of its two buildings and its brewery equipment and concurrently entered a
long-term lease agreement for the same property and equipment. In connection with the lease the Company has the option to repurchase
the buildings and brewery equipment from 12 months after the commencement date to the end of the lease term at the greater of
the fair market value or an agreed upon amount. Since the lease contains a buyback provision and other related terms
 the Company
determined it had continuing involvement that did not warrant the recognition of a sale; therefore
 the transaction has been accounted
for as a long-term financing. The proceeds from the sale
 net of transaction costs
 have been recorded as a financing obligation
in the amount of $3
056
000. Monthly payments under the financing agreement are recorded as interest expense and a reduction in
the financing obligation at an implicit rate of 9.9%. The financing obligation was personally guaranteed up to a limit of $150
000
by the principal shareholder
 former Chief Executive Officer and current Chief Innovation Officer
 Christopher
J. Reed.

In
connection with the financing obligation
 the Company issued an aggregate of 400
000 warrants to purchase its common stock at
$1.20 per share for five years. The 400
000 warrants were valued at $752
000 and reflected as a debt discount
 using the Black
Scholes Merton option pricing model. The following assumptions were utilized in valuing the 400
000 warrants: strike price of
$2.10 to $2.25; term of 5 years; volatility of 91.36% to 110.9%; expected dividends 0%; and discount rate of 2.15% to 2.20%. The
400
000 warrants were recorded as valuation discount and are being amortized over 15 years
 the term of the purchase option. Amortization
of valuation discount was $50
000 during both of the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015.

Effective
October 1
 2014
 the Company executed Amendment #1 to the Long-term Financing Obligation. In exchange for a release from the $150
000
personal guarantee by the principal shareholder and Chief Executive Office
 and a release of the brewery equipment which was collateral
for the lease agreement
 the Company issued 200
000 warrants to purchase its common stock for $5.60 per share for five years.
The 200
000 warrants were valued at $584
000 using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model and were recorded as a valuation
discount. The following assumptions were made in valuing the 200
000 warrants; term of 5 years
 volatility of 59.53%
 expected
dividends 0% and discount rate of 1.25%. The warrants value of $584
000 is being amortized over the remaining term of the purchase
option.


    
    


The
aggregate amount due under the financing obligation at December 31
 2016 and 2015 was $2
377
000 and $2
538
000
 respectively.

In addition
 the company leases vehicles and office equipment with rates and monthly payments range from $189 to $10
441 per month
including interest
 at interest rates ranging from 3.50% to 17.31% per annum. The principal balance due under these leases was
$621

The
Company issued warrants to investors and a placement agent as part of our June 2
 2016 financing transaction. In accordance with
ASC 480
 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (&ldquo;ASC 480&rdquo;)
 the fair value of these warrants are classified as a
liability on the Company&rsquo;s balance sheet as according to the warrant terms
 a fundamental transaction could give rise to
an obligation of the Company to pay cash to such warrant holders. Corresponding changes to the fair value of the warrants are
recognized in earnings on the Company&rsquo;s statements of operations in each subsequent period.

The
warrant liability was valued at the following dates using Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with the following average
assumptions:



    
    
December 31
 2016

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
543
000
775
000


The
risk-free interest rate was based on rates established by the Federal Reserve Bank. The Company uses the historical volatility
of its common stock to estimate the future volatility for its common stock. The expected life of the warrant was determined by
the remaining contractual life of the warrant instrument. The expected dividend yield was based on the fact that the Company has
not paid dividends to its common stockholders in the past and does not expect to pay dividends to its common stockholders in the
future.

A Preferred stock can be converted into four shares of Reed&rsquo;s common stock.


    
    


The
Series A Preferred shares have a 5% pro-rata annual non-cumulative dividend. The dividend can be paid in cash or
 in the sole
and absolute discretion of our board of directors
 in shares of common stock based on its then fair market value. We cannot declare
or pay any dividend on shares of our securities ranking junior to the preferred stock until the holders of our preferred stock
have received the full non-cumulative dividend to which they are entitled. In addition
 the holders of our preferred stock are
entitled to receive pro rata distributions of dividends on an &ldquo;as converted&rdquo; basis with the holders of our common
stock. During the year ended December 31

000 dividend

 which the board of directors elected to pay through the issuance of 1
504 shares
of its common stock. During the year ended December 31
 2015 the Company paid a $5

through the issuance of 751 shares of its common stock.

In
the event of any liquidation
 dissolution or winding up of the Company
 or if there is a change of control event
 then
 subject
to the rights of the holders of our more senior securities
 if any
 the holders of our Series A preferred stock are entitled to
receive
 prior to the holders of any of our junior securities
 $10.00 per share plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. Thereafter
all remaining assets shall be distributed pro rata among all of our security holders. Since June 30
 2008
 we have the right
but not the obligation
 to redeem all or any portion of the Series A preferred stock by paying the holders thereof the sum of
the original purchase price per share
 which was $10.00
 plus all accrued and unpaid dividends.

The
Series A preferred stock may be converted
 at the option of the holder
 at any time after issuance and prior to the date such
stock is redeemed
 into four shares of common stock
 subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits
 reverse stock splits
stock dividends
 recapitalization
 reclassification and similar transactions. We are obligated to reserve out of our authorized
but unissued shares of common stock enough such shares to affect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A preferred
stock. During 2016
 no shares of Series A preferred stock were converted into common stock.

Except
as provided by law
 the holders of our Series A preferred stock do not have the right to vote on any matters
 including
 without
limitation
 the election of directors. However
 so long as any shares of Series A preferred stock are outstanding
 we shall not

During
the year ended December 31
 2016
 the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with institutional investors in a
private financing transaction for the issuance and sale of 692
412 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock and warrants to
purchase 346
206 shares of common stock. The net proceeds to the Company from the offering were $2
113
000 after deducting underwriting
discounts
 commissions and offering expenses. The investor warrants have an exercise price of $4.25 per share and a term of 5
years. As per the terms of the offering
 the placement agent received 72
703 warrants and a term of 5 years at an exercise price
of $3.74.

In
connection with the issuance of the warrants
 the Company recorded a warrant liability on its balance sheet as a fundamental transaction
could give rise to an obligation of the Company to pay cash to such warrant holders. Corresponding changes to the fair value of
the warrants are recognized in earnings on the Company&rsquo;s statements of operations in each subsequent period. The Company
determined the aggregate initial fair value of the warrants in the financing transaction to be $543
000 valued using Black-Scholes-Merton
option pricing model. For financial statement purposes
 the amount of the warrant liability created from the issuance of the warrants
of $543
000 has been offset to the net cash proceeds received of $2
113
000
 resulting in a reduction of additional
paid-in capital of $543
000 from the sale of the shares of common stock and warrants.

During
the year ended December 31
 2016
 the Company sold 30
000 shares of its common stock to certain officers of the Company at $3.90
per share with total proceeds of $117

 the Company adopted the Reed&rsquo;s Inc. 2007 Stock Option Plan and in 2015 the Company adopted the Reed&rsquo;s Inc. 2015
Incentive and Non-statutory Stock Option Plan (the &ldquo;Plans&rdquo;). The options under both plans shall be granted from time
to time by the Board of Directors. Individuals eligible to receive options include employees of the Company
 consultants to the
Company and directors of the Company. The options shall have a fixed price
 which will not be less than 100% of the fair market
value per share on the grant date or 110% of the fair market value per share on the grant date for Chief Executive Officer of
the Company. The total number of options authorized is 1
500
000 and 500
000
 respectively for the Plans.


    
    


During
the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015
 the Company granted 172
500 and 548
000 options
 respectively
 to purchase the Company&rsquo;s
common stock at a weighted exercise price of $4.01 and $5.63
 respectively
 to employees under the Plans. The fair value of the
options granted during the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015 was $714
000 and $1
398
000
 respectively.

The
weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted during 2016 and 2015 was $4.01 and $2.54
 respectively. The fair value
of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model that uses the assumptions
noted in the following table. For purposes of determining the expected life of the option
 an average of the estimated holding
period is used. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the options is based on the U. S. Treasury yield
in effect at the time of the grant.

Income
    Taxes


At
December 31
 2016 and 2015
 the Company had available Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future taxable
income. The amounts available were approximately $21.3 million and $18.6 million for Federal purposes
 respectively
 and
$14.5 million and $13.3 million for state purposes respectively. The Federal carryforward expires in 2034 and the state
carryforward expires in 2019. Given the Company&rsquo;s history of net operating losses
 management has determined that it is
more likely than not that the Company will not be able to realize the tax benefit of the carryforwards. Accordingly
 the Company
has not recognized a deferred tax asset for this benefit.

Effective
January 1
 2007
 the Company adopted FASB guidelines that address the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected
to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this guidance
 we may recognize the tax benefit
from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the
taxing authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from
such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized
upon ultimate settlement. This guidance also provides guidance on derecognition
 classification
 interest and penalties on income
taxes
 accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. At the date of adoption
 and as of December 31
 2016
and 2015
 the Company did not have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits
 and no adjustment was required at adoption.

The
Company&rsquo;s policy is to record interest and penalties on uncertain tax provisions as income tax expense. As of December 31
2016
 and 2015
 the Company has not accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Additionally
 tax years
2009 through 2016 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.


    
    


Upon
the attainment of taxable income by the Company
 management will assess the likelihood of realizing the tax benefit associated
with the use of the carryforwards and will recognize the appropriate deferred tax asset at that time.

Significant
components of the Company&rsquo;s deferred income tax assets are as follows as of:

Commitments
    and Contingencies


Lease
Commitments

The
Company leases warehouse space under non-cancelable operating leases. Rental expense under these and other operating leases for
the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015 was $137
000 and $209
000
 respectively. These leases expire in November 2017.

Future
payments under these leases as of December 31
 2016
 are as follows:





    

    
137
000

    
    

    
137
000


Other
Commitments

The
Company has entered into contracts with customers with clauses that commit the Company to pay fees if the Company terminates the
agreement early or without cause. The contracts call for the customer to have the right to distribute the Company&rsquo;s products
to a defined type of retailer within a defined geographic region. If the Company should terminate the contract or not automatically
renew the agreements without cause
 amounts would be due to the customer. As of December 31
 2016 and 2015
 the Company has no
plans to terminate or not renew any agreement with any of their customers; therefore
 no such fees have been accrued in the accompanying
financial statements.



    
Legal
    Proceedings


From
time to time
 we are a party to claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Our management evaluates
our exposure to these claims and proceedings individually and in the aggregate and provides for potential losses on such litigation
if the amount of the loss is estimable and the loss is probable.

We
believe that there are no material litigation matters at the current time. Although the results of such litigation matters and
claims cannot be predicted with certainty
 we believe that the final outcome of such claims and proceedings will not have a material
adverse impact on our financial position
 liquidity
 or results of operations.

the supervision and with the participation of our management

 as such term is defined under Securities and Exchange Act
of 1934 Rules 13a-15(f). Based on this evaluation

the Company&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31

 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting.


Management&rsquo;s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records
that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of the Company&rsquo;s assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.


Because
of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness
of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2016. In making this assessment
 we used the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control &mdash;
Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment we concluded that
 as of December 31
 2016
 the Company&rsquo;s internal control
over financial reporting was effective.

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management&rsquo;s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting
firm
 pursuant to provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that permit us to provide only management&rsquo;s
report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

This
report shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act
 or otherwise subject to the liabilities
of that section
 and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company
 whether made before or after the date hereof
regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.

 Management and Related Stockholder Matters

The

 the beneficial common stock ownership of: (a) each of our directors
 (b) each
of our current named executive officers
 (c) each person known by us to be a beneficial holder of 5% or more of our common stock
and (d) all of our executive officers and directors as a group.

Except
as otherwise indicated below
 the persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares

Less than 1%.

Beneficial
ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Shares of common stock subject to options or warrants currently
exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of March 24
 2016 are deemed outstanding for computing the percentage ownership of the
stockholder holding the options or warrants but are not deemed outstanding for computing the percentage ownership of any other
stockholder. Unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes to this table
 we believe stockholders named in the table have sole voting
and sole investment power with respect to the shares set forth opposite such stockholder&rsquo;s name. Percentage of ownership
is based on 13
908
247 shares of common stock outstanding as of March 24
 2016.

Jointly owned with his wife
 Judy Reed.

Item
13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
 and Director Independence

Our
board of directors has adopted written policies and procedures for the review of any transaction
 arrangement or relationship
between Reed&rsquo;s and one of our executive officers
 directors
 director nominees or 5% or greater stockholders (or their immediate
family members)
 each of whom we refer to as a &ldquo;related person
&rdquo; in which such related person has a direct or indirect
material interest.


    
    


If
a related person proposes to enter into such a transaction
 arrangement or relationship
 defined as a &ldquo;related party transaction
&rdquo;
the related party must report the proposed related party transaction to our Chief Financial Officer. The policy calls for the
proposed related party transaction to be reviewed and
 if deemed appropriate
 approved by the Nominations and Governance Committee.
Our Nominations and Governance Committee is comprised of Dr. Muffoletto
 Mark Harris and Mr. Fischman. The board of directors
has determined that all of the members of the Nominations and Governance Committee are independent under the rules of the New
York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual. If practicable
 the reporting
 review and approval will occur prior to entry into the
transaction. If advance review and approval is not practicable
 the Nominations and Governance Committee will review
 and
 in
its discretion
 may ratify the related party transaction. Any related party transactions that are ongoing in nature will be reviewed
annually at a minimum. The related party transactions listed below were reviewed by the full board of directors. Prior to August
2005
 we did not have independent directors on our board to review and approve related party transactions. The Nominations and
Governance Committee shall review future related party transactions.

During
the years December 31
 2016 and 2014
 we have participated in the following transactions in which a related person had or will
have a direct or indirect material interest:

During
the year ended December 31
 2008
 the Company entered into an agreement for the distribution of its products internationally.
The agreement is between the Company and a company controlled by two brothers of Christopher Reed
 Chief Executive Officer of
the Company. The agreement was terminated on January 1
 2015. During the year ended December 31
 2016
 the Company paid no commissions
and for the year ended December 31
 2015 paid commissions of $1
000.

Item
14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services

Weinberg
&amp; Company
 P.A. (&ldquo;Weinberg&rdquo;) was our independent registered public accounting firm for the years ended December
31
 2016 and 2015.

The
following table shows the fees paid or accrued by us for the audit and other services provided by Weinberg for the years ended
December 31
 2016 and 2015.

As
defined by the SEC
 (i) &ldquo;audit fees&rdquo; are fees for professional services rendered by our principal accountant for the
audit of our annual financial statements and review of financial statements included in our Form 10-K
 or for services that are
normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years;
(ii) &ldquo;audit-related fees&rdquo; are fees for assurance and related services by our principal accountant that are reasonably
related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under &ldquo;audit fees;&rdquo;
(iii) &ldquo;tax fees&rdquo; are fees for professional services rendered by our principal accountant for tax compliance
 tax advice
and tax planning; and (iv) &ldquo;all other fees&rdquo; are fees for products and services provided by our principal accountant
other than the services reported under &ldquo;audit fees
&rdquo; &ldquo;audit-related fees
&rdquo; and &ldquo;tax fees.&rdquo;

Audit
Fees

Services
provided to us by Weinberg with respect to such periods consisted of the audits of our financial statements and limited reviews
of the financial statements included in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Weinberg also provided services with respect to the filing
of our registration statements in 2016 and 2015.


    
    


Audit
Related Fees

Weinberg
did not provide any professional services to us with which would relate to &ldquo;audit related fees.&rdquo;

Tax
Fees

Weinberg
prepared our 2015 and 2014 Federal and state income taxes.

All
Other Fees

Weinberg
did not provide any professional services to us with which would relate to &ldquo;other fees.&rdquo;

Audit
Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures

Under
the SEC&rsquo;s rules
 the Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent
registered public accounting firm in order to ensure that they do not impair the auditors&rsquo; independence. The Commission&rsquo;s
rules specify the types of non-audit services that an independent auditor may not provide to its audit client and establish the
Audit Committee&rsquo;s responsibility for administration of the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm.

Consistent
with the SEC&rsquo;s rules
 the Audit Committee Charter requires that the Audit Committee review and pre-approve all audit services
and permitted non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm to us or any of our subsidiaries.
The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to a member of the Audit Committee and if it does
 the decisions of that
member must be presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. Accordingly
 100% of audit services and non-audit
services described in this Item 14 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.

There
were no hours expended on the principal accountant&rsquo;s engagement to audit the registrant&rsquo;s financial statements for
the most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by persons other than the principal accountant&rsquo;s full-time
permanent employees.

    and




    
The
    registrant&rsquo;s other certifying officer and I have disclosed
 based on our most recent evaluation of internal control
    over financial reporting to the registrant&rsquo;s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant&rsquo;s board of directors
    (or persons performing the equivalent functions):




    
    
All
    significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting
    which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant&rsquo;s ability to record
 process
 summarize and report financial
    information; and

    
    
    

    
    
Any
    fraud
 whether or not material
 that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant&rsquo;s
    internal control over financial reporting.

 the Company closed&#13;escrow on the sale of its two buildings and its brewery equipment and concurrently entered a long-term lease agreement for the&#13;same property and equipment. In connection with the lease the Company has the option to repurchase the buildings and brewery equipment&#13;from 12 months after the commencement date to the end of the lease term at the greater of the fair market value or an agreed upon&#13;amount. Since the lease contains a buyback provision and other related terms
 the Company determined it had continuing involvement&#13;that did not warrant the recognition of a sale; therefore
 the transaction has been accounted for as a long-term financing. The&#13;proceeds from the sale
 net of transaction costs
 have been recorded as a financing obligation in the amount of $3
056
000. Monthly&#13;payments under the financing agreement are recorded as interest expense and a reduction in the financing obligation at an implicit&#13;rate of 9.9%. The financing obligation was personally guaranteed up to a limit of $150
000 by the principal shareholder
 former&#13;Chief Executive Officer and current Chief Innovation Officer

&#13;the Company issued an aggregate of 400
000 warrants to purchase its common stock at $1.20 per share for five years. The 400
000&#13;warrants were valued at $752
000 and reflected as a debt discount
 using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model. The following&#13;assumptions were utilized in valuing the 400
000 warrants: strike price of $2.10 to $2.25; term of 5 years; volatility of 91.36%&#13;to 110.9%; expected dividends 0%; and discount rate of 2.15% to 2.20%. The 400
000 warrants were recorded as valuation discount&#13;and are being amortized over 15 years
 the term of the purchase option. Amortization of valuation discount was $50
000 during both&#13;of the years ended December 31

 2014
 the Company&#13;executed Amendment #1 to the Long-term Financing Obligation. In exchange for a release from the $150
000 personal guarantee by&#13;the principal shareholder and Chief Executive Office
 and a release of the brewery equipment which was collateral for the lease&#13;agreement
 the Company issued 200
000 warrants to purchase its common stock for $5.60 per share for five years. The 200
000 warrants&#13;were valued at $584
000 using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model and were recorded as a valuation discount. The following&#13;assumptions were made in valuing the 200
000 warrants; term of 5 years
 volatility of 59.53%
 expected dividends 0% and discount&#13;rate of 1.25%. The warrants value of $584

 2016 and 2015 was $2

 inventory obsolescence
 depreciable lives&#13;of property and equipment
 analysis of impairments of recorded long term assets and intangibles

 a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded
 which reduces&#13;the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer&#13;identification of potential bad debts

 2016 and&#13;2015
 the allowance for doubtful accounts and returns and discounts was approximately $256
000 and $356
000

&#13;general market conditions or other factors
 which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction in the rate of reorders&#13;placed by customers. Additionally
 our management&amp;#8217;s estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate


 management prepares an estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the&#13;asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset
 an impairment loss is recognized&#13;to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. For the years ended December 31
 2016 the Company recognized a charge of $260

 but are assessed for impairment&#13;annually and evaluated annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate. As part of our impairment test
&#13;we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset&#13;is impaired. If further testing is necessary
 we compare the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset with&#13;its book value. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value
 as determined by its discounted&#13;cash flows
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For the years ended December 31
 2016 the Company&#13;recognized an impairment charge of $224

 the Financial Accounting&#13;Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09&#13;is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current&#13;U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. Under ASU 2014-09
 revenue is recognized&#13;when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which&#13;the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition
 the standard requires disclosure of the nature
&#13;amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The FASB has recently issued ASU&#13;2016-08
 ASU 2016-10
 ASU 2016-11
 ASU 2016-12
 and ASU 2016-20 all of which clarify certain implementation guidance within ASU&#13;2014-09. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted&#13;only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods therein. The standard can be adopted&#13;either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method)
 or retrospectively with the cumulative&#13;effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method).&#13;The Company is currently in the process of analyzing the information necessary to determine the impact of adopting this new guidance&#13;on its financial position
 results of operations

 the FASB issued ASU&#13;No. 2016-02
 Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance&#13;sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning&#13;after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for&#13;capital and operating leases existing at
 or entered into after

 the FASB issued the ASU&#13;2016-09
 Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments&#13;in this ASU require
 among other things
 that all income tax effects of awards be recognized in the income statement when the awards&#13;vest or are settled. The ASU also allows for an employer to repurchase more of an employee&amp;#8217;s shares than it can today for&#13;tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as&#13;they occur. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15

 volatility of 49.52%
 expected dividends 0% and discount rate&#13;of 0.74%. The incremental value of the warrants before and after the modification of $38
000 will be amortized over the remaining&#13;24 months of the term loans. Reed&amp;#8217;s also agreed to pay a one-time fee of $35

&#13;2016 and 2015 amortization of the discount was $130
000 and $9
000 respectively
 and the unamortized discount was $78

 Inc. (the &amp;#8220;Company&amp;#8221;)&#13;was organized under the laws of the state of Florida in January 1991. In 2001
 the Company changed its name from Original Beverage&#13;Corporation to Reed&amp;#8217;s
 Inc. and changed its state of incorporation from Florida to Delaware. The Company is engaged primarily&#13;in the business of developing
 manufacturing and marketing natural non-alcoholic beverages
 as well as candies and ice creams.&#13;We currently manufacture


 Cream Sodas
 Dr. Better and Real Cola
 including ZERO diet sodas




 supermarket chains

 2016 the Company recorded&#13;a net loss of $ 5
009
000 and utilized cash in operations of $2
533
000. As of December 31
 2016
 we had a working capital deficiency&#13;of $1
563
000 and a stockholders&amp;#8217; deficit of $1
657

 2017
 the Company had&#13;a cash balance of $197
000 and had available borrowing on our existing line of credit of $191
000. On April 21
 2017
 the Company&#13;issued a convertible note resulting in net proceeds of $3
240
000. Furthermore
 during the year ended December 31
 2016
 we were&#13;able to extend the maturity date of our operating line of credit and our other bank loans through October 21

 we have financed our&#13;operations primarily through private sales of common stock
 preferred stock
 a line of credit from a financial institution and&#13;cash generated from operations. We anticipate that our primary capital source will be positive cash flow from operations. If our&#13;sales goals do not materialize as planned
 we believe that the Company can reduce its operating costs and achieve positive cash&#13;flow from operations. However
 we may not generate sufficient revenues from product sales in the future to achieve profitable&#13;operations. If we are not able to achieve profitable operations at some point in the future
 we may have insufficient working&#13;capital to maintain our operations as we presently intend to conduct them or to fund our expansion
 marketing
 and product development&#13;plans. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms

 the aggregate&#13;intrinsic value of $26










 2016 and 2015
 the Company&#13;had available Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future taxable income. The amounts available were approximately&#13;$21.3 million and $18.6 million for Federal purposes
 respectively
 and $14.5 million and $13.3 million for state purposes respectively.&#13;The Federal carryforward expires in 2034 and the state carryforward expires in 2019. Given the Company&amp;#8217;s history of net operating&#13;losses
 management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will not be able to realize the tax benefit&#13;of the carryforwards. Accordingly

 2007
 the Company&#13;adopted FASB guidelines that address the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return&#13;should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this guidance
 we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position&#13;only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
 based on the&#13;technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured&#13;based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. This&#13;guidance also provides guidance on derecognition
 classification
 interest and penalties on income taxes
 accounting in interim&#13;periods and requires increased disclosures. At the date of adoption
 and as of December 31
 2016 and 2015
 the Company did not&#13;have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits

 2016
 and 2015
 the Company has not&#13;accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Additionally

 a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded

 our management&amp;#8217;s estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate



 management prepares an estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of&#13;the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset
 an impairment loss&#13;is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. For the years ended December 31
 2016 the Company recognized&#13;a charge of $260


 but are assessed&#13;for impairment annually and evaluated annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate. As part of our&#13;impairment test
 we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived&#13;intangible asset is impaired. If further testing is necessary
 we compare the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible&#13;asset with its book value. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value
 as determined&#13;by its discounted cash flows
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For the years ended December&#13;31
 2016 the Company recognized an impairment charge of $224
000 for the China Cola brand. For 2015

 the Financial Accounting&#13;Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09&#13;is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current&#13;U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. Under ASU 2014-09
 revenue is recognized&#13;when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which&#13;the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition
 the standard requires disclosure of the nature
&#13;amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The FASB has recently issued ASU&#13;2016-08
 ASU 2016-10
 ASU 2016-11
 ASU 2016-12
 and ASU 2016-20 all of which clarify certain implementation guidance within ASU&#13;2014-09. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted&#13;only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods therein. The standard can be adopted&#13;either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method)
 or retrospectively with the cumulative&#13;effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method).&#13;The Company is currently in the process of analyzing the information necessary to determine the impact of adopting this new guidance&#13;on its financial position
 results of operations

 the FASB issued ASU&#13;No. 2016-02
 Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance&#13;sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning&#13;after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for&#13;capital and operating leases existing at
 or entered into after

 the FASB issued the ASU&#13;2016-09
 Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments&#13;in this ASU require
 among other things
 that all income tax effects of awards be recognized in the income statement when the awards&#13;vest or are settled. The ASU also allows for an employer to repurchase more of an employee&amp;#8217;s shares than it can today for&#13;tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as&#13;they occur. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]








    
    




    
    



 Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;)
was organized under the laws of the state of Florida in January 1991. In 2001
 the Company changed its name from Original Beverage
Corporation to Reed&#8217;s
 Inc. and changed its state of incorporation from Florida to Delaware. The Company is engaged primarily
in the business of developing
 manufacturing and marketing natural non-alcoholic beverages
 as well as candies and ice creams.
We currently manufacture
 market and sell seven unique product lines:



    
Reed&#8217;s Ginger Brews


    
    

    
Virgil&#8217;s Root Beer
 Cream Sodas
 Dr. Better and Real Cola
 including ZERO diet sodas


    
    

    
Culture Club Kombucha


    
    

    
China Colas


    
    

    
Reed&#8217;s Ginger candy and ice creams
 

    
    

    
    



in natural food stores
 supermarket chains
 and upscale gourmet stores in the United States and Canada.



    
    



have been prepared under the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern. Such assumption contemplates the realization
of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the year ended December 31
 2016 the Company recorded
a net loss of $ 5
009
000 and utilized cash in operations of $2
533
000. As of December 31
 2016
 we had a working capital deficiency
of $1
563
000 and a stockholders&#8217; deficit of $1
657
000.


 2017
 the Company had
a cash balance of $197
000 and had available borrowing on our existing line of credit of $191
000. On April 21
 2017
 the Company
issued a convertible note resulting in net proceeds of $3
240
000. Furthermore
 during the year ended December 31
 2016
 we were
able to extend the maturity date of our operating line of credit and our other bank loans through October 21
 2018. We estimate
the Company currently has sufficient cash and liquidity to meet its anticipated working capital for the next twelve months.


 we have financed our
operations primarily through private sales of common stock
 preferred stock
 a line of credit from a financial institution and
cash generated from operations. We anticipate that our primary capital source will be positive cash flow from operations. If our
sales goals do not materialize as planned
 we believe that the Company can reduce its operating costs and achieve positive cash
flow from operations. However
 we may not generate sufficient revenues from product sales in the future to achieve profitable
operations. If we are not able to achieve profitable operations at some point in the future
 we may have insufficient working
capital to maintain our operations as we presently intend to conduct them or to fund our expansion
 marketing
 and product development
plans. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms
 or at all.







The entire disclosure for the nature of an entity's business
 major products or services
 principal markets including location
 and the relative importance of its operations in each business and the basis for the determination
 including but not limited to
 assets
 revenues
 or earnings. For an entity that has not commenced principal operations
 disclosures about the risks and uncertainties related to the activities in which the entity is currently engaged and an understanding of what those activities are being directed toward.

in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Those estimates and assumptions include estimates for reserves of uncollectible accounts
 inventory obsolescence
 depreciable lives
of property and equipment
 analysis of impairments of recorded long term assets and intangibles
 accruals for potential liabilities
and assumptions made in valuing stock instruments issued for services.



    
    



of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific customer&#8217;s
inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company
 a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded
 which reduces
the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer
identification of potential bad debts
 bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company&#8217;s historical losses and an overall
assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding.


and returns and discounts is established through a provision reducing the carrying value of receivables. At December 31
 2016 and
2015
 the allowance for doubtful accounts and returns and discounts was approximately $256
000 and $356
000
 respectively.



    
    



of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. We regularly review
our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast
of product demand and/or our ability to sell the product(s) concerned and production requirements. Demand for our products can
fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for our products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences
general market conditions or other factors
 which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction in the rate of reorders
placed by customers. Additionally
 our management&#8217;s estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate
 which could result
in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory.



    
    



cost. Expenditures for major renewals and improvements that extend the useful lives of property and equipment or increase production
capacity are capitalized
 and expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is calculated
using accelerated and straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:



    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    



of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If there is indication of impairment
 management prepares an estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the
asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset
 an impairment loss is recognized
to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. For the years ended December 31
 2016 the Company recognized a charge of $260
000
for impairments for its property and equipment in anticipation of early retirement of equipment with the Los Angeles plant. There
were no charges for equipment impairment prior to that in the prior years.



    
    



brand names acquired and have been assigned an indefinite life as we currently anticipate that these brand names will contribute
cash flows to the Company perpetually. These indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized
 but are assessed for impairment
annually and evaluated annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate. As part of our impairment test
we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset
is impaired. If further testing is necessary
 we compare the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset with
its book value. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value
 as determined by its discounted
cash flows
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For the years ended December 31
 2016 the Company
recognized an impairment charge of $224
000 for the China Cola brand. For 2015
 the Company did not recognize any impairment charges
for its indefinite-lived intangible assets.



    
    



deposit with banks are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250
000 at December 31
 2016. The Company
may be exposed to risk for the amounts of funds held in bank accounts more than the insurance limit. In assessing the risk
 the
Company&#8217;s policy is to maintain cash balances with high quality financial institutions. The Company had cash balances more
than the guarantee during the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015.


 2016
the Company had two customers who accounted for approximately 22% and 12% of its sales
 respectively; and during the year ended
December 31
 2015
 the Company had two customers who accounted for approximately 28% and 14% of its sales
 respectively. No other
customer accounted for more than 10% of sales in either year. As of December 31
 2016
 the Company had accounts receivable due
from one customer who comprised $719
000 (25%) of its total accounts receivable; and as of December 31
 2015
 the Company had accounts
receivable due from two customers who comprised $782
000 (24%) and $373
000 (12%)
 respectively
 of its total accounts receivable.
No other customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable in either year.


 2016
the Company had utilized three separate co-pack packers for most its production and bottling of beverage products in the Eastern
United States. Although there are other packers and the Company has outfitted our own brewery and bottling plant
 a change in packers
may cause a delay in the production process
 which could ultimately affect operating results.

based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and liability approach
 deferred taxes
are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it
is more likely than not these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize their benefits
 or that future deductibility
is uncertain. The Company&#8217;s policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax

options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing costs. The
Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative guidance provided
by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) whereas the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized
as compensation expense on the straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants
issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the FASB whereas the value of the stock compensation
is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached
 or b) at the
date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Options granted to non-employees are revalued
each reporting period to determine the amount to be recorded as an expense in the respective period. As the options vest
 they
are valued on each vesting date and an adjustment is recorded for the difference between the value already recorded and the then
current value on the date of vesting. In certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements by the non-employee
option grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement
date.


stock option and warrant grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model
 which uses certain assumptions
related to risk-free interest rates
 expected volatility
 expected life of the stock options or warrants
 and future dividends.
Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model
 and based on
actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could materially affect compensation expense
recorded in future periods.

 the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09
is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current
U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. Under ASU 2014-09
 revenue is recognized
when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which
the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition
 the standard requires disclosure of the nature
amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The FASB has recently issued ASU
2016-08
 ASU 2016-10
 ASU 2016-11
 ASU 2016-12
 and ASU 2016-20 all of which clarify certain implementation guidance within ASU
2014-09. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted
only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods therein. The standard can be adopted
either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method)
 or retrospectively with the cumulative
effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method).
The Company is currently in the process of analyzing the information necessary to determine the impact of adopting this new guidance
on its financial position
 results of operations
 and cash flows. The Company will adopt the provisions of this statement in the
first quarter of fiscal 2018.


 the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-02
 Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance
sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for
capital and operating leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial
statements. The Company is currently evaluating the expected impact that the standard could have on its financial statements and
related disclosures.


 the FASB issued the ASU
2016-09
 Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments
in this ASU require
 among other things
 that all income tax effects of awards be recognized in the income statement when the awards
vest or are settled. The ASU also allows for an employer to repurchase more of an employee&#8217;s shares than it can today for
tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as
they occur. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods
within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. The Company is currently
evaluating the expected impact that the standard could have on its financial statements and related disclosures.

the first loan was prime plus 5.75% (currently 9.5%)
 and the rate on the second loan was prime plus 11.60% (currently 14.85%)
but was modified on December 7
 2016 such that the new rate will be based on the trailing 6 month EBITDA. If the EBITDA measuring
point stays below $1
000
000 where it is now
 the rate will rise to 12% from the current rate of 9%. If EBITDA rises to $1

000 respectively.



    
    



Agreement with PMC
 the Company entered into a Capital expansion loan which
 after amendment allows a total borrowing of $4
700
000.
The loans are secured by all of the property and equipment purchased under the loan. The interest rate on the CAPEX loan is the
prime rate plus 5.75% (9.5% at December 31
 2016). Interest only is payable on CAPEX Loans through January 31
 2017
 at which time
principal and interest will be aggregated and repaid in equal monthly payments of principal and interest based on 48 month amortization.
Currently
 the estimated amount that will become due in a year is $953
000. At December 31
 2016 and 2015
 the balance on the CAPEX
loan balance was $3
950
000 and $1

 and as of December 31
 2016
 the Company had future borrowing availability
of $750

by the Company immediately.



    
    



 2015
 as part of restructuring
of the Term Loans with PMC
 the Company granted PMC 125
000 warrants at an exercise price of $4.50 per share for five years and
six months. The 125
000 warrants were valued at $141
000 using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model and were recorded
as a valuation discount. The following assumptions were made in valuing the 125
000 warrants; term of 5.5 years
 volatility of
56.04%
 expected dividends 0% and discount rate of 0.68%. The value of the warrants of $141
000 was recorded as a valuation discount
and is being amortized over the remaining 16 months of the term loans.


 2016
 as part of a further
restructuring of the loans with PMC
 the Company granted PMC 50
000 warrants at an exercise price of $4.50 per share with a term
of five years and six months. The 50
000 warrants were valued at $38
000 using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model and
were recorded as a valuation discount. The following assumptions were made in valuing the 50
000 warrants; term of 5.5 years
 volatility
of 54.17%
 expected dividends of 0% and discount rate of 1.49%. The value of the warrants of $38
000 was recorded as a valuation
discount and is being amortized over the remaining term of the loans.


 2016
 the Company agreed
to reprice the exercise price of 50
000 common stock purchase warrants granted under Amendment Twelve from $4.50 to $4.10 and to
reprice the exercise price of 125
000 common stock purchase warrants granted under Amendment Ten from $5.01 to $4.10. The following
assumptions were made in repricing the warrants; term of 3.5 years
 volatility of 49.52%
 expected dividends 0% and discount rate
of 0.74%. The incremental value of the warrants before and after the modification of $38
000 will be amortized over the remaining
24 months of the term loans. Reed&#8217;s also agreed to pay a one-time fee of $35
000.


2016 and 2015 amortization of the discount was $130
000 and $9
000 respectively
 and the unamortized discount was $78
000 and $132
000

 2009
 the Company closed
escrow on the sale of its two buildings and its brewery equipment and concurrently entered a long-term lease agreement for the
same property and equipment. In connection with the lease the Company has the option to repurchase the buildings and brewery equipment
from 12 months after the commencement date to the end of the lease term at the greater of the fair market value or an agreed upon
amount. Since the lease contains a buyback provision and other related terms
 the Company determined it had continuing involvement
that did not warrant the recognition of a sale; therefore
 the transaction has been accounted for as a long-term financing. The
proceeds from the sale
 net of transaction costs
 have been recorded as a financing obligation in the amount of $3
056
000. Monthly
payments under the financing agreement are recorded as interest expense and a reduction in the financing obligation at an implicit
rate of 9.9%. The financing obligation was personally guaranteed up to a limit of $150
000 by the principal shareholder
 former
Chief Executive Officer and current Chief Innovation Officer
 Christopher J. Reed.


the Company issued an aggregate of 400
000 warrants to purchase its common stock at $1.20 per share for five years. The 400
000
warrants were valued at $752
000 and reflected as a debt discount
 using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model. The following
assumptions were utilized in valuing the 400
000 warrants: strike price of $2.10 to $2.25; term of 5 years; volatility of 91.36%
to 110.9%; expected dividends 0%; and discount rate of 2.15% to 2.20%. The 400
000 warrants were recorded as valuation discount
and are being amortized over 15 years
 the term of the purchase option. Amortization of valuation discount was $50
000 during both
of the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015.


 2014
 the Company
executed Amendment #1 to the Long-term Financing Obligation. In exchange for a release from the $150
000 personal guarantee by
the principal shareholder and Chief Executive Office
 and a release of the brewery equipment which was collateral for the lease
agreement
 the Company issued 200
000 warrants to purchase its common stock for $5.60 per share for five years. The 200
000 warrants
were valued at $584
000 using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model and were recorded as a valuation discount. The following
assumptions were made in valuing the 200
000 warrants; term of 5 years
 volatility of 59.53%
 expected dividends 0% and discount
rate of 1.25%. The warrants value of $584
000 is being amortized over the remaining term of the purchase option.


obligation at December 31
 2016 and 2015 was $2

future volatility for its common stock. The expected life of the warrant was determined by the remaining contractual life of the
warrant instrument. The expected dividend yield was based on the fact that the Company has not paid dividends to its common stockholders
in the past and does not expect to pay dividends to its common stockholders in the future.

 2016 and 2015
 the Company
had available Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future taxable income. The amounts available were approximately
$21.3 million and $18.6 million for Federal purposes
 respectively
 and $14.5 million and $13.3 million for state purposes respectively.
The Federal carryforward expires in 2034 and the state carryforward expires in 2019. Given the Company&#8217;s history of net operating
losses
 management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will not be able to realize the tax benefit
of the carryforwards. Accordingly
 the Company has not recognized a deferred tax asset for this benefit.


 2007
 the Company
adopted FASB guidelines that address the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return
should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this guidance
 we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position
only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
 based on the
technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured
based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. This
guidance also provides guidance on derecognition
 classification
 interest and penalties on income taxes
 accounting in interim
periods and requires increased disclosures. At the date of adoption
 and as of December 31
 2016 and 2015
 the Company did not
have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits
 and no adjustment was required at adoption.


interest and penalties on uncertain tax provisions as income tax expense. As of December 31
 2016
 and 2015
 the Company has not
accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Additionally
 tax years 2009 through 2016 remain open to examination
by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.


 management
will assess the likelihood of realizing the tax benefit associated with the use of the carryforwards and will recognize the appropriate
deferred tax asset at that time.


deferred income tax assets are as follows as of:

in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Those estimates and assumptions include estimates for reserves of uncollectible accounts
 inventory obsolescence
 depreciable
lives of property and equipment
 analysis of impairments of recorded long term assets and intangibles
 accruals for potential
liabilities and assumptions made in valuing stock instruments issued for services.







    
    



of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific customer&#8217;s
inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company
 a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded
 which reduces
the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer
identification of potential bad debts
 bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company&#8217;s historical losses and an overall
assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding.


and returns and discounts is established through a provision reducing the carrying value of receivables. At December 31

 respectively.







    
    



of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. We regularly review
our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast
of product demand and/or our ability to sell the product(s) concerned and production requirements. Demand for our products can
fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for our products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences
general market conditions or other factors
 which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction in the rate of
reorders placed by customers. Additionally
 our management&#8217;s estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate
 which
could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory.







    
    



cost. Expenditures for major renewals and improvements that extend the useful lives of property and equipment or increase production
capacity are capitalized
 and expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is calculated
using accelerated and straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:



    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    



of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If there is indication of impairment
 management prepares an estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of
the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset
 an impairment loss
is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. For the years ended December 31
 2016 the Company recognized
a charge of $260
000 for impairments for its property and equipment in anticipation of early retirement of equipment with the
Los Angeles plant. There were no charges for equipment impairment prior to that in the prior years.







    
    



indefinite-lived brand names acquired and have been assigned an indefinite life as we currently anticipate that these brand names
will contribute cash flows to the Company perpetually. These indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized
 but are assessed
for impairment annually and evaluated annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate. As part of our
impairment test
 we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived
intangible asset is impaired. If further testing is necessary
 we compare the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible
asset with its book value. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value
 as determined
by its discounted cash flows
 an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For the years ended December
31
 2016 the Company recognized an impairment charge of $224
000 for the China Cola brand. For 2015
 the Company did not recognize
any impairment charges for its indefinite-lived intangible assets.

 2016. The Company
may be exposed to risk for the amounts of funds held in bank accounts more than the insurance limit. In assessing the risk
 the
Company&#8217;s policy is to maintain cash balances with high quality financial institutions. The Company had cash balances more

 2016
the Company had two customers who accounted for approximately 22% and 12% of its sales
 respectively; and during the year ended
December 31
 2015
 the Company had two customers who accounted for approximately 28% and 14% of its sales
 respectively. No other
customer accounted for more than 10% of sales in either year. As of December 31
 2016
 the Company had accounts receivable due
from one customer who comprised $719
000 (25%) of its total accounts receivable; and as of December 31
 2015
 the Company had accounts
receivable due from two customers who comprised $782
000 (24%) and $373

 respectively
 of its total accounts receivable.
No other customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable in either year.


 2016
the Company had utilized three separate co-pack packers for most its production and bottling of beverage products in the Eastern
United States. Although there are other packers and the Company has outfitted our own brewery and bottling plant
 a change in packers
may cause a delay in the production process
 which could ultimately affect operating results.


2016 and 2015
 the Company had one vendor which accounted for approximately 26% and 25%
 respectively of purchases. At December

 2016 and 2015
 the Company had accounts payable due to two vendors who comprised 13% and 10% for the year ended December 31
2016
 and 14% and 12% of its total accounts payable

are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if
it is more likely than not these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize their benefits
 or that future
deductibility is uncertain. The Company&#8217;s policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters
in income tax expense.







    
    



a product when the risk of loss transfers to our customers
 and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured
 which generally
occurs when the product is shipped. A product is not shipped without an order from the customer and credit acceptance procedures
performed. The allowance for returns is regularly reviewed and adjusted by management based on historical trends of returned items.
Amounts paid by customers for shipping and handling costs are included in sales.

by dividing the net income (loss) applicable to Common Stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
during the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) applicable to Common Stockholders
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding
if all dilutive potential common shares had been issued
 using the treasury stock method. Potential common shares are excluded
from the computation if their effect is antidilutive.


 2016
and 2015
 the calculations of basic and diluted loss per share are the same because potential dilutive securities would have an
anti-dilutive effect. The potentially dilutive securities consisted of the following as of:

options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing costs. The
Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative guidance provided
by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) whereas the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized
as compensation expense on the straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants
issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the FASB whereas the value of the stock compensation
is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached
 or b) at the
date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Options granted to non-employees are revalued
each reporting period to determine the amount to be recorded as an expense in the respective period. As the options vest
 they
are valued on each vesting date and an adjustment is recorded for the difference between the value already recorded and the then
current value on the date of vesting. In certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements by the non-employee
option grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement
date.


stock option and warrant grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model
 which uses certain assumptions
related to risk-free interest rates
 expected volatility
 expected life of the stock options or warrants
 and future dividends.
Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model
 and based on
actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could materially affect compensation
expense recorded in future periods.

 the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09
is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current
U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. Under ASU 2014-09
 revenue is recognized
when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which
the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition
 the standard requires disclosure of the nature
amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The FASB has recently issued ASU
2016-08
 ASU 2016-10
 ASU 2016-11
 ASU 2016-12
 and ASU 2016-20 all of which clarify certain implementation guidance within ASU
2014-09. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted
only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods therein. The standard can be adopted
either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method)
 or retrospectively with the cumulative
effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method).
The Company is currently in the process of analyzing the information necessary to determine the impact of adopting this new guidance
on its financial position
 results of operations
 and cash flows. The Company will adopt the provisions of this statement in the
first quarter of fiscal 2018.


 the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-02
 Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance
sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for
capital and operating leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial
statements. The Company is currently evaluating the expected impact that the standard could have on its financial statements and
related disclosures.


 the FASB issued the ASU
2016-09
 Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments
in this ASU require
 among other things
 that all income tax effects of awards be recognized in the income statement when the awards
vest or are settled. The ASU also allows for an employer to repurchase more of an employee&#8217;s shares than it can today for
tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as
they occur. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods
within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. The Company is currently
evaluating the expected impact that the standard could have on its financial statements and related disclosures.

Tabular disclosure of warrants or rights issued. Warrants and rights outstanding are derivative securities that give the holder the right to purchase securities (usually equity) from the issuer at a specific price within a certain time frame. Warrants are often included in a new debt issue to entice investors by a higher return potential. The main difference between warrants and call options is that warrants are issued and guaranteed by the company
 whereas options are exchange instruments and are not issued by the company. Also
 the lifetime of a warrant is often measured in years
 while the lifetime of a typical option is measured in months. Disclose the title of issue of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the aggregate amount of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the date from which the warrants or rights are exercisable
 and the price at which the warrant or right is exercisable.
