Item
1. Business.

Our
Company

Sipup
Corporation was incorporated on October 31
 2012 under the laws of the State of Nevada for the purpose of producing
 packing and
selling flavored yogurts. &nbsp;We currently have no revenue generating business.

The
Company is presently negotiating the terms of a proposed transaction whereby the Company would acquire approx. 48% of the outstanding
capital stock of a company listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and engaged in software development for end users utilizing multi
languages translators. The proposed transaction is subject to the negotiation
 execution and delivery of definitive agreements
as well as the satisfaction of certain significant additional conditions. We are also exploring opportunities in the real estate
industry. No assurance can be provided that the Company will be successful in entering these businesses.&nbsp;



    
    


Organization
within the last five years

On
October 31
 2012
 the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada. Through fiscal year 2013
 we were engaged
in the production
 packing and selling of flavored yogurts and have not generated any revenue; our independent auditors have issued
an opinion about our ability to continue as a going concern in connection with our audited financial statements for the year ended
November 30
 2016. Our accumulated deficit is $136
041 as of November 30
 2016. We currently have no revenue generating business
and are focusing on finalizing the transaction with the Target Company.

The
discussion below provides an overview of our operations
 discusses our results of operations
 our plan of operations and our liquidity
and capital resources.

We
are authorized to issue 75
000
000 shares of common stock
 par value $.001 per share. On November 19
 2012
 we issued 3
000
000
shares of common stock to our sole officer and director on that date. Mr. Naeem purchased such 3
000
000 shares at a purchase
price of $0.001 per share
 for an aggregate purchase price of $3
000.

On
December 5
 2013
 Mr. Nissim Barih (&ldquo;Barih&rdquo;) and several other unrelated persons (each a &ldquo;Buyer&rdquo; and collectively
the &ldquo;Buyers&rdquo;)
 closed on a transaction (the &ldquo;Purchase&rdquo;) in which the Buyers acquired a total of 3
000
000
shares (the &ldquo;Shares&rdquo;) of common stock
 par value $0.001 per share (the &ldquo;Common Stock&rdquo;) of Sipup from Rashid
Naeem
 the Company&rsquo;s sole director and officer (&ldquo;Naeem&rdquo;) immediately prior to the Purchase. The Purchase was
consummated pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement by and among the Buyers and Naeem. The aggregate purchase price paid for
the Shares was $131
000. The Shares represented&nbsp;in the aggregate 75% of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company&rsquo;s
Common Stock.&nbsp;Barih
 one of the Buyers
 holds 2
475
000 of the Shares
 representing approximately 61% of all of our issued
and outstanding Common Stock. The funds used to consummate the Purchase of the Shares were the personal funds of each participating
Buyer. Accordingly
 the purchase of the Shares resulted in a change in control of the Company.

In
connection with the above transaction
 Naeem resigned from all officers&rsquo; positions that he held in the Company
 including
President
 Chief Executive Officer
 Secretary and Treasurer
 which resignation became effective immediately upon the closing of
the Purchase.&nbsp;&nbsp;Contemporaneously with closing of the Purchase
 Jacob Daddon was appointed as our President and Chief
Executive Officer and our sole director. Effective July 1 2014
 Messrs Rafi Elul and Peretz Winkler were appointed director and
chief executive officer and director
 respectively
 whereupon Mr. Daddon resigned. Thereafter
 Effective March 17
 2015
 Mr. Elul
resigned and effective December 21
 2015
 Mr. Baruch Yadid was appointed as a director
 Mr. Yochai Ozeri was appointed as Interim
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and as a director and Mr. Natanael Solomon was appointed VP Marketing and
Investor Relations and as a director.

During
December 2016
 the Company and Rosario Capital Ltd. (&ldquo;Rosario&rdquo;) having their principal places of business at Tel Aviv
Israel have entered into service agreement
 pursuant to which. Rosario is providing to the Company certain critical advisory and
other services. In consideration of any and all Rosario&rsquo;s Services
 the Company has issued to Rosario 500
000 restricted shares
of common stock.



We
were incorporated on October 31
 2012 in the State of Nevada. We have never declared bankruptcy
 have never been in receivership
and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since incorporation
 we have not made any significant purchase
or sale of assets. &nbsp;.

From
inception until the date of this filing we have had limited operating activities.&nbsp;Our financial statements from inception
(October 31
 2012) through our fiscal year ended November 30
 2016 report no revenues and a net loss of $136
041. Our independent
auditor has issued an audit opinion for our Company which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability
to continue as a going concern.

We
have no revenues and have incurred losses since inception.


    
    




We
do not maintain any insurance. Because we do not have any insurance
 if we are made a party of a legal action
 we may not have
sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease
operations.



As
of June 19
 2017
 we have two employees
 all of whom are officers and work out of Israel. None of our employees are subject to
a collective bargaining agreement.

Government
Regulation

We
will be required to comply with all regulations
 rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies in any jurisdiction
which we would conduct activities in the future. As of now there are no required governments approvals present that we need approval
from or any existing government regulation on our business.

We
currently have not obtained any copyrights
 patents or trademarks. We do not anticipate filing any copyright or trademark applications
related to any assets over the next 12 months.

Plan
of Operation

Our
cash balance is $Nil as of November 30
 2016. We do not believe that our cash balance is sufficient to fund our limited levels
of operations beyond one year&rsquo;s time.

Our
independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we
can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is
because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development. There
is no assurance we will ever reach that stage.

We
anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents will be insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least
the next 12 months. We will require additional funds prior to such time and the Company will seek to obtain these funds by selling
additional capital through private equity placements
 debt or other sources of financing. If we are unable to obtain sufficient
additional financing
 we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned operations
 which could harm our business
 financial
condition and operating results. Additional funding to meet our requirements may not be available on favorable terms
 if at all.

At
the present time
 we have been able to raise additional cash by selling of common stock
 it will likely not be sufficient to support
our planned operations. If we are unable to raise the cash needed to support our operations
 we will either suspend product development
and marketing activities until we do raise the cash
 or cease operations entirely

The
Company is presently negotiating the terms of a proposed transaction whereby the Company would acquire approx. 48% of the outstanding
capital stock of a company listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and engaged in software development for end users utilizing multi
languages translators. The proposed transaction is subject to the negotiation
 execution and delivery of definitive agreements
as well as the satisfaction of certain significant additional conditions. We are also exploring opportunities in the real estate
industry. Non assurance can be provided that the Company will be successful in entering these businesses.



    
    


Subject
to raising working capital
 for which we have no commitments
 management may also consider other business opportunities
 including
a strategic merger or acquisition outside our current line of business
 in order to increase shareholder value.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition
 changes in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures or capital
resources.

Limited
operating history; Need for additional capital

There
is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage
operations and have not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business
is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise
 including limited capital resources and possible
cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.

We
have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory
terms
 we may be unable to continue
 develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to
existing shareholders.

Item
1A. Risk Factors.

Company is a smaller reporting company as defined by rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information
required under this item.

 if any
 in the future

and will depend on our then current financial condition
 results of operations
 capital requirements and other factors deemed
relevant by the Board of Directors. There are no contractual restrictions on our ability to declare or pay dividends.

SECURITIES
AUTHORIZED UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS

We
have no equity compensation or stock option plans. We may in the future adopt a stock option plan as our mineral exploration activities
progress.


    
    


Item
7. Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Results
of Operations

From
November 30
 2015 to November 30
 2016

During
the period
 we incorporated the Company
 Our loss since inception is $136
041 related primarily
to professional fees
 officers&rsquo; compensation
 and the incorporation of the Company
 bank charges and office supplies. We have
not meaningfully commenced our proposed business operations and will not do so until after receiving sufficient financing.

Since
inception
 we have offered and sold (i) 3
000
000 shares of common stock to Rashid Naeem
 our former officer and a director
 at
a purchase price of $0.001 per share
 for aggregate proceeds of $3
000 and we have offered and sold 1
000
000 shares at a purchase
price of $0.05 per share
 for aggregate proceeds of $50
000.



For
the year ended November 30
 2016 and 2015
 we had no revenues.

Costs
and Operating Expenses

During
the year ended November 30
 2016 we had recorded expenses of $24
200 comprised of Professional fees of $11
000
 filling fees of
$1
200 and payroll related compensation of $12
000 resulting in a net loss of $24
200 as compared to expenses of $16
131 comprised
of Professional fees of $14
500
 and filling fees of $1
631 resulting in a net loss of $16
131 for the fiscal year ended November
30
 2015.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

As
of November 30
 2016
 the company had $Nil cash and our liabilities were $70
973
 consisting primarily of Accounts payable and
accrued expenses of $59
418 and Loans payable of $11
555. As of November 30
 2015
 the company had $Nil cash and our liabilities
were $46
773
 consisting primarily of Accounts payable and accrued expenses of $39
718 and Loans payable of $7
055. The available
capital reserves of the Company are not sufficient for the Company to remain operational.

During
2016 and 2015 a stockholder advanced the Company $4
500 and $2
500
 respectively
 to pay expenses.&nbsp;

Our
auditors have issued a &ldquo;going concern&rdquo; opinion
 meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going
business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until after receiving
sufficient financing and implementing our plan of operations. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business.
The Company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately $25
000.

Existing
working capital
 further advances and debt instruments
 and anticipated cash flow are expected to be inadequate to fund our operations
over the next twelve months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally
 we have financed operations
to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan
 management
anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii)
developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. Although we intend to finance these
expenses with further issuances of securities
 and debt issuances
 no assurance can be provided that we will be able to raise
funds on commercially acceptable terms or at all.

We
anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations
 if any
 will be insufficient to satisfy
our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. We will require additional funds prior to such time and the Company
will seek to obtain those funds by selling additional capital through private equity placements
 debt or other sources of financing.
If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional financing
 we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned operations
which could harm our business
 financial condition and operating results. Additional funding to meet our requirements may not
be available on favorable terms
 if at all.

At
the present time
 we have been able to raise additional cash by selling of common stock
 it will likely not be sufficient to support
our planned operations. If we are unable to raise the cash needed to support our operations
 we will either suspend product development
and marketing activities until we do raise the cash
 or cease operations entirely. Because we have been unable to raise additional
cash
 Management may consider other business opportunities in order to maintain and increase shareholder value.

We
are highly dependent upon the success of the private offerings of equity or debt securities
 as described herein. Therefore
 the
failure thereof would result in the need to seek capital from other resources such as taking loans
 which would likely not even
be possible for the Company. At such time these funds are required
 management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing.
If the Company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its equity or debt securities
 or secure a loan
 the
Company would be required to cease business operations. As a result
 investors would lose all of their investment.


    
    


Significant
Accounting Policies

Basis
of Presentation

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America and are presented in US dollars.

Use
of Estimates

Management
uses estimates and assumption in preparing these financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
 the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities
 and the reported revenues and expenses.

Income
Taxes

The
Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740 &ldquo;Income Taxes&rdquo; which codified SFAS 109
 &ldquo;Accounting for Income
Taxes&rdquo; and FIN 48 &ldquo;Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes &ndash; an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.&rdquo;
Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740
 the effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance
is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through
future operations.

Fail
Value of Financial Instruments

Accounting
Standards Codification Topic 820
 &ldquo;Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments&rdquo;
 requires the Company to
disclose
 when reasonably attainable
 the fair market values of its assets and liabilities which are deemed to be financial instruments.
The Company&rsquo;s financial instruments consist primarily of cash.

Per
Share Information

The
Company computes net loss per share accordance with FASB ASC 205 &ldquo;Earnings per Share&rdquo;. FASB ASC 205 requires presentation
of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net
loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the
period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS excludes
all potentially dilutive shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures.

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a
process designed by
 or under the supervision of
 the Company&rsquo;s principal executive and principal financial officers and
effected by the Company&rsquo;s board of directors
 management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:



    
Pertains
    to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of
    assets;




    
Provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and receipts and expenditures are being made
    in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and




    
Provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of company assets
    that could have a material effect on our financial statements.


Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our President and principal financial officer
 an evaluation
was performed on the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation
 our President and principle executive officer
 who also acts as our principal
financial officer
 concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered
by this report for the purpose of gathering
 analyzing and disclosing of information that the Company is required to disclose
in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 within the time periods specified in the SEC&rsquo;s rules
and forms.

Management&rsquo;s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

As
of November 30
 2016 management assessed the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting based
on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&ldquo;COSO&rdquo;) and SEC guidance on conducting
such assessments. Based on that evaluation
 they concluded that
 during the period covered by this report
 such internal control
over financial reporting were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below.
This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal control over financial reporting that adversely
affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.

The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that the Company&rsquo;s management considered to be material weaknesses under
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee due to the lack
of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors
 resulting in ineffective
oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties
consistent with control objectives; and (3) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes.
The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer in connection with the review of our financial
statements as of November 30
 2016.

Management
believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2) and (3) above did not have an effect on our financial results. However
management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of
directors
 results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures which
could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.

In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls
 we have initiated
or plan to initiate the following series of measures.

We
will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical
accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to us. And we plan to appoint one or more outside
directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment
and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by
management when funds are available to us.

Management
believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors
 who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee
will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board.

We
will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over
financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or
improvements
 as necessary and as funds allow.

There
have been no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of
2016 which has materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal controls over financial reporting.

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company&rsquo;s independent registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting. Management&rsquo;s report was not subject to attestation by the Company&rsquo;s independent
registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company
to provide management report in the Annual Report.

Baruch
Yadid
 Age 60

the last 10 years Mr. Yadid was involved&nbsp;in several real estates and commercial deals in Israel and abroad

Director
Independence

None
of our directors presently qualify as an independent director in accordance with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ
Global Market. The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests
 such as that the director is not
 and
has not been for at least three years
 one of our employees and that neither the director
 nor any of his family members has engaged
in various types of business dealings with us. In addition
 our board of director has not made a subjective determination as to
its sole director that no relationships exist which
 in the opinion of our board of director
 would interfere with the exercise
of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director
 though such subjective determination is required by
the NASDAQ rules. &nbsp;Had our board of director made these determinations
 our board of director would have reviewed and discussed
information provided by the director and us with regard to each director business and personal activities and relationships as
they may relate to us and our management.




    
    


Conflicts
of Interest

Since
we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors
 the functions that would have been performed
by such committees are performed by our current directors. The Board of Director has not established an audit committee and does
not have an audit committee financial expert
 nor has the Board established a nominating committee. The Board is of the opinion
that such committees are not necessary since the Company is an early development stage company
 and to date
 such directors have
been performing the functions of such committees. Thus
 there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors have the
authority to determine issues concerning management compensation
 nominations
 and audit issues that may affect management decisions.

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings

There
are no legal proceedings that have occurred in the past 10 years concerning our sole officer and director which involved a criminal
conviction
 a criminal proceeding
 an administrative or civil proceeding limiting one&rsquo;s participation in the securities
or banking industries
 or a finding of securities or commodities law violations.&nbsp;

FAMILY
RELATIONS

There
are no family relationships among the directors and officers of Sipup Corporation.

AUDIT
COMMITTEE AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Since
we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors
 the functions that would have been performed
by such committees are performed by our directors. The Board of Directors has not established an audit committee and does not
have an audit committee financial expert
 nor has the Board of Directors established a nominating committee. The Board is of the
opinion that such committees are not necessary since the Company is an early exploration stage company and has only two directors
and to date
 such directors have been performing the functions of such committees. Thus
 there is a potential conflict of interest
in that our directors and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation
 nominations
 and
audit issues that may affect management decisions.

There
are no family relationships among our directors or officers. Other than as described above
 we are not aware of any other conflicts
of interest with any of our executive officers or directors.

CODE
OF ETHICS

The
Company has not adopted a code of ethics that applies to its principal executive officers
 principal financial officer
 principal
accounting officer or controller
 or persons performing similar functions. The Company has not adopted a code of ethics because
it currently has minimal operations.

SECTION
16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

Section
16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our executive officers and directors
 and persons who own more than ten
percent of a registered class of our equity securities
 file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Executive
officers
 directors and greater-than-ten percent stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with all Section 16(a)
forms they file. Based on our review of filings made on the SEC website
 and the fact of us not receiving certain forms or written
representations from certain reporting persons that they have complied with the relevant filing requirements
 we believe that
during the year ended November 30
 2016
 none of our executive officers
 directors and greater-than-ten percent stockholders complied
with all Section 16(a) filing requirements.&nbsp;

Item
11. Executive Compensation.

of the same securities

REPORT OF&nbsp;THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


of



accompanying balance sheets of Sipup Corporation (hereinafter
 &ldquo;the Company&rdquo;) as of November 30
 2016 and 2015
 and
the related statements of income
 cash flow and stockholders&rsquo; equity for the years then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.


in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


 the
financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of Sipup Corporation as
of November 30
 2016 and 2015 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the period described above in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial
statements
 the Company has not established sufficient source of revenue to cover its operating costs. As of November 30
 2016
the Company does not have sufficient working capital and cash resources to meet its planned business objectives. These and other
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. Management&rsquo;s plan regarding
these matters is also described in Note 2 to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTE 2 &ndash; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The principal accounting
policies are set out below
 these policies have been consistently applied to the period presented
 unless otherwise stated:




statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts or revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.




include investments with initial maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its cash balances at credit-worthy financial
institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&ldquo;FDIC&rdquo;) up to $250
000.




accrued expenses are carried at amortized cost and represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company prior to
the end of the financial year that are unpaid and arise when the Company becomes obliged to make future payments in respect of
the purchase of these goods and services.




net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260
 &ldquo;Earnings Per Share&rdquo; ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted
earnings per share (&ldquo;EPS&rdquo;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss
attributable to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders and the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding for the effects of all potential dilutive common shares
 which comprise options granted to employees.
As November 30
 2016
 the Company had no potentially dilutive shares.


    
    





for in accordance with ASC Topic 740
 &ldquo;Income Taxes.&rdquo; Under the asset and liability method
 deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (temporary differences). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled.
Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized.




for equity instruments issued to employees in accordance with ASC 718
 Compensation - Stock Compensation. ASC 718 requires all
share-based compensation payments to be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value using an option pricing
model. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures
differ from initial estimates.


to non-employees are accounted for in accordance with ASC 505
 Equity. The final measurement date for the fair value of equity
instruments with performance criteria is the date that each performance commitment for such equity instrument is satisfied or there
is a significant disincentive for non-performance.




assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements
which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability
 as the case may be
in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such
 fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework
for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs
 used in valuation techniques
 are assigned
a hierarchical level.


hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:


markets for identical instruments;

inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments);

inputs (including assumptions in determining the fair value of certain investments).




the adoption of any other recently issued accounting pronouncements in 2016 had a significant impact on our financial position

 &amp;#8220;Earnings Per Share&amp;#8221; ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (&amp;#8220;EPS&amp;#8221;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the effects of all potential dilutive common shares
 which comprise options granted to employees. As November 30
 2016
 the Company had no potentially dilutive shares.&lt;/p&gt;

 &amp;#8220;Income Taxes.&amp;#8221; Under the asset and liability method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (temporary differences).

Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.&lt;/p&gt;

 which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability
 as the case may be
 in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such
 fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring
 fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs
 used in valuation techniques
 are assigned a hierarchical level.&lt;/p&gt;

 which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability
 as the case may be
 in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such
 fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs
 used in valuation techniques
 are assigned a hierarchical level.&lt;/p&gt;

 computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260
 &#8220;Earnings Per Share&#8221; ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the effects of all potential dilutive common shares
 which comprise options granted to employees. As November 30
 2016
 the Company had no potentially dilutive shares.




 &#8220;Income Taxes.&#8221; Under the asset and liability method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (temporary differences). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.




 Compensation - Stock Compensation. ASC 718 requires all share-based compensation payments to be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value using an option pricing model. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.


 Equity. The final measurement date for the fair value of equity instruments with performance criteria is the date that each performance commitment for such equity instrument is satisfied or there is a significant disincentive for non-performance.

 fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring
 fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs
 used in valuation techniques
 are assigned a hierarchical level.
