 package
 label and store our products at our facility in Coconut Creek
 Florida. We manufacture 100% of our products.&nbsp; By manufacturing our own products
 we believe that we maintain better control over product quality and availability while also reducing production costs.


 we retain the services of outside GMP audit firms to assist in our efforts to comply with GMPs.&nbsp; In 2013
 we used the services of ASI Food Safety Consultants
 Inc.
 a GMP audit firm to assist us with our GMP compliance.




 we are unable to obtain any of our raw materials from our suppliers
 we believe that we could obtain alternative sources of any raw materials from other suppliers. We do not have contracts with our suppliers and we order our raw materials on an as-needed basis. We have not experienced any material adverse effects on our business as a result of shortages of raw materials or packaging materials used in the manufacturing of our products. An unexpected interruption or a shortage in supply of raw materials could adversely affect our business derived from these products.





















 minerals
 dietary supplements
 herbs
 botanicals and compounds derived therefrom. Numerous manufacturers and distributors compete with us for customers throughout the United States in the packaged nutritional supplement industry selling products to retailers such as mass merchandisers

 however
 it is unlikely that such materials are likely to result in the violation of any existing environmental rules and/or regulations. Further
 we do not own any real property that could lead to liability as a landowner. Therefore
 we do not anticipate that there will be any material costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

000. Product liability claims may result in significant legal costs related to our defense of such actions if the amounts exceed our product liability insurance coverage. The design
 development
 and manufacture of products for human consumption involves an inherent risk of product liability claims and corresponding damage to our brand name reputation
 including claims of product failure or harm caused by our products. As such
 any product liability claim could adversely affect our business.









 manufacturing
 packaging
 labeling
 advertising
 distribution and sale (hereafter
 &quot;sale&quot; or &quot;sold&quot; may be used to signify all of these activities) of our products are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies
 principally the Food and Drug Administration (&quot;FDA&quot;) and the Federal Trade Commission (&quot;FTC&quot;)
 and to a lesser extent the Consumer Product Safety Commission (&quot;CPSC&quot;)
 the United States Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency. Our activities are also regulated by various governmental agencies for the states and localities in which our products are sold
 as well as by governmental agencies in certain countries outside the United States in which our products are sold. Among other matters
 regulation by the FDA and FTC are concerned with product safety and claims made with respect to a product's ability to provide health-related benefits. Specifically
 the FDA
 under the Federal Food
 Drug
 and Cosmetic Act (&quot;FDCA&quot;)
 regulates the formulation
 manufacturing
 packaging
 labeling
 distribution and sale of food
 including dietary supplements
 and over-the-counter drugs. The FTC regulates the advertising of these products. The National Advertising Division (&quot;NAD&quot;) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus oversees an industry-sponsored
 self-regulatory system that permits competitors to resolve disputes over advertising claims. The NAD has no enforcement authority of its own
 but may refer matters that appear to violate the Federal Trade Commission Act or the FDCA to the FTC or the FDA for further action
 as appropriate.


 primarily the FDA and the FTC
 have a variety of procedures and enforcement remedies available to them
 including initiating investigations
 issuing warning letters and cease-and-desist orders
 requiring corrective labeling or advertising
 requiring consumer redress (for example
 requiring that a company offer to repurchase products previously sold to consumers)
 seeking injunctive relief or product seizures
 imposing civil penalties
 or commencing criminal prosecution. In addition
 certain state agencies have similar authority. These federal and state agencies have in the past used these remedies in regulating participants in the food
 dietary supplement and over-the-counter drug industries
 including the imposition of civil penalties in the millions of dollars against a few industry participants.


 amending the FDCA. We believe DSHEA is generally favorable to consumers and to the dietary supplement industry. DSHEA establishes a statutory class of &quot;dietary supplements
&quot; which includes vitamins
 minerals
 herbs
 amino acids and other dietary ingredients for human use to supplement the diet. Dietary ingredients marketed in the United States before October 15
 1994 may be marketed without the submission of a &quot;new dietary ingredient&quot; (&quot;NDI&quot;) premarket notification to the FDA. Dietary ingredients not marketed in the United States before October 15
 1994 may require the submission
 at least 75 days before marketing
 ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe for its intended use. Among other things
 DSHEA prevents the FDA from regulating dietary ingredients in dietary supplements as &quot;food additives&quot; and allows the use of statements of nutritional support on product labels and in labeling. The FDA has issued final regulations under DSHEA and has issued draft guidance on NDI notification requirements. Further guidance and regulations are expected. Several bills to amend DSHEA in ways that would make this law less favorable to consumers and industry have been proposed in Congress.


 we may need to revise our product labeling. Most of our products are classified as dietary supplements.







 2007. The GMPs cover manufacturers and holders of finished dietary supplement products
 including dietary supplement products manufactured outside the United States that are imported for sale into the United States. Among other things
 the new GMPs: (a) require identity testing on all incoming dietary ingredients
 (b) call for a &quot;scientifically valid system&quot; for ensuring finished products meet all specifications
 (c) include requirements related to process controls
 including statistical sampling of finished batches for testing and requirements for written procedures and (d) require extensive recordkeeping.


 there can be no assurance that our operations or those of our suppliers will be in compliance in all respects at all times. Additionally
 there is a potential risk of increased audits as the FDA and other regulators seek to ensure compliance with the GMP&#146;s.


 2006
 Congress passed the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act
 which went into effect on December 22
 2007. The law requires
 among other things
 that companies that manufacture or distribute nonprescription drugs or dietary supplements report serious adverse events allegedly associated with their products to the FDA and institute recordkeeping requirements for all adverse events (serious and non-serious). There is a risk that consumers
 the press and government regulators could misinterpret reported serious adverse events as evidence of causation by the ingredient or product complained of
 which could lead to additional regulations
 banned ingredients or products
 increased insurance costs and a potential increase in product liability litigation
 among other things.


 the CPSIA requires testing and certification of certain products and enhances the CPSC's authority to order recalls.


 enacted January 4
 2011
 amended the FDCA to significantly enhance the FDA's authority over various aspects of food regulation. The FSMA granted the FDA mandatory recall authority when the FDA determines if there is reasonable probability that a food is adulterated or misbranded and that the use of
 or exposure to
 the food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. Other changes include the FDA's expanded access to records; the authority to suspend food facility registrations and require high risk imported food to be accompanied by a certification; stronger authority to administratively detain food; the authority to refuse admission of an imported food if it is from a foreign establishment to which a U.S. inspector is refused entry for an inspection; and the requirement that importers verify that the foods they import meet domestic standards.


 except dietary supplement facilities in compliance with both GMPs and the serious adverse event reporting requirements. Although dietary supplement facilities are exempt from the HARBPC requirements
 dietary ingredient facilities might not qualify for the exemption. The HARBPC requirements
 which the FDA has yet to propose
 are expected to be onerous because facilities will have to develop and implement preventive controls to assure that identified hazards are significantly minimized or prevented
 monitor the effectiveness of the preventive controls and maintain numerous records related to the HARBPC. The HARBPC requirements may increase the costs of dietary ingredients and/or affect our ability to obtain dietary ingredients.







 the FDA published in July 2011 a draft guidance document clarifying when the FDA believes a dietary ingredient is an NDI
 when a manufacturer or distributor must submit an NDI premarket notification to the FDA
 the evidence necessary to document the safety of an NDI and the methods for establishing the identity of an NDI. The draft guidance
 if implemented as proposed
 could have a material impact on our operations. Although our industry has strongly objected to several aspects of the draft guidance
 it is unclear whether the FDA will make changes to the final guidance. In addition
 it is possible that the FDA will begin taking enforcement actions consistent with the interpretations in the draft guidance before issuing a final version.


 as well as the FDA enforcement of the NDI guidance as written
 could require us to incur additional expenses
 which could be significant
 and negatively impact our business in several ways
 including
 but not limited to
 the detention and refusal of admission of imported products
 the injunction of manufacturing of any dietary ingredients or dietary supplements until the FDA determines that such ingredients or products are in compliance and the potential imposition of fees for re-inspection of noncompliant facilities. Each of these events would increase our liability and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
 results of operations or cash flows.


 and have also coordinated enforcement against dietary supplement claims in other areas
 including children's products. Their efforts to date have focused on manufacturers and marketers as well as media outlets
 and have resulted in a significant number of investigations and enforcement actions
 some resulting in civil penalties of several million dollars under the Federal Trade Commission Act. We expect that the FTC and the FDA will continue to focus on health-related claims for dietary supplements and foods
 and our products could be the subject of an FTC/FDA inquiry.

 as that term is generally defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to mean equity securities with a price of less than $5.00. Thus
 our shares will be subject to rules that impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who engage in certain transactions involving a penny stock.







 a broker-dealer selling a penny stock to anyone other than an established customer must make a special suitability determination regarding the purchaser and must receive the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the sale
 unless the broker-dealer is otherwise exempt.


 under the penny stock regulations
 the broker-dealer is required to:



 prior to any transaction involving a penny stock
 a disclosure schedule prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market
 unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt;






 the account's value
 and information regarding the limited market in penny stocks; and



 prior to conducting any penny stock transaction in the customer's account.


 broker-dealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our common stock
 which may affect the ability of our shareholders or to sell their shares in the secondary market
 and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our securities
 if our securities become publicly traded. In addition
 the liquidity for our securities may be decreased
 with a corresponding decrease in the price of our securities. Our shares in all probability will be subject to such penny stock rules and our shareholders will
 in all likelihood
 find it difficult to sell their securities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.

Note 1 &#150; Description of Business Basis of Presentation
 and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies




 Inc. (&#147;We&#148;
 or the &#147;Company&#148;) is the producer and distributor of nutritional supplements that uses micro molecular formulae and a utilization of an oral spray to provide faster and more efficient absorption.







 &#150; Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.&nbsp; The Company had no cash equivalents at December 31
 2013 or 2014.

 &#150; The Company&#146;s financial statements are prepared under the accrual method of accounting. Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 services have been rendered
 the sales price is fixed or determinable
 and collectability is reasonably assured. This occurs only when the product is ordered and subsequently shipped.



 &#150; We establish the existence of bad debts through a review of several factors including historical collection experience
 current aging status of the customer accounts
 and financial condition of our customers.

 &#150; Property and equipment are carried at the cost of acquisition or construction and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Costs associated with repair and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with improvements which extend the life
 increase the capacity or improve the efficiency of our property and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the related asset. Gains and losses on dispositions of equipment are reflected in operations. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets
 which are 7 to 13 years.




 we have sustained losses from inception
 including net losses in excess of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31
 2014
 and have working capital and accumulated deficits that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.&nbsp; In response to these conditions
 we may raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity securities
 or through borrowings from financial institutions or individuals. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

 the Company carried out an evaluation
 with the participation of the Company&#146;s management
 including the Company&#146;s President
 Chief Financial Officer
 Secretary
 Treasurer and Director
 of the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation
 the Company&#146;s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act
 is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms
 and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company&#146;s management
 including the Company&#146;s CEO and CFO
 as appropriate
 to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure for the reasons discussed below.




 in general
 provide reasonable assurance to the Company&#146;s management and board regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements
 but because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.&nbsp;


 2014. The framework used by management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled &#147; Internal Control &#150; Integrated Framework&#148; issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment
 our President and Chief Financial Officer have determined and concluded that
 as of December 31
 2014
 the Company&#146;s internal controls over financial reporting were not effective.


 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control our financial reporting as of December 31
 2014
 the Company determined that the following items constituted a material weakness:



 which would provide oversight of the Company&#146;s officers
 operations and financial reporting function;



 which consists of a limited number of personnel
 does not provide adequate segregation of duties; and





 who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee
 will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of 












 fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31
 2014
 that has materially affected
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

 a person is deemed to be a &quot;beneficial owner&quot; of a security if that person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of the security or the power to dispose or direct the disposition of the security. A person is deemed to own beneficially any security as to which such person has the right to acquire sole or shared voting or investment power within 60 days through the conversion or exercise of any convertible security
 warrant
 option or other right. More than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities. The percentage of beneficial ownership by any person as of a particular date is calculated by dividing the number of shares beneficially owned by such person
 which includes the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within 60 days
 by the sum of the number of shares outstanding as of such date. Consequently
 the denominator used for calculating such percentage may be different for each beneficial owner. Except as otherwise indicated below and under applicable community property laws

 and Nominating or Governance Committees as standing committees. The Board does not have an executive committee or any committees performing a similar function. We are not currently listed on a national securities exchange or in an inter-dealer quotation system that has requirements that a majority of the Board of Directors be independent. Our Sole Director has determined that he is not &#147;independent&#148; under the definition set forth in the listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market
 Inc.
 which is the definition that the Board has chosen to use for the purposes of the determining independence
 as the OTC Bulletin Board does not provide such a definition. Therefore
 our Sole Director is not independent.


 we have used the definition of &#147;independence&#148; of The NASDAQ Stock Market to make this determination. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that an &#147;independent director&#148; is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual having a relationship which
 in the opinion of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors
 would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The NASDAQ listing rules provide that a director cannot be considered independent if:



 or at any time during the past three years was
 an employee of the company;



000 during any period of 12 consecutive months within the three years preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exclusions
 including
 among other things
 compensation for board or board committee service);



 or at any time during the past three years was
 an executive officer of the company;








 controlling stockholder of
 or an executive officer of an entity to which the company made
 or from which the company received
 payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5% of the recipient&#146;s consolidated gross revenue for that year or $200
000
 whichever is greater (subject to certain exclusions);



 at any time during the past three years
 any of the executive officers of the company served on the compensation committee of such other entity; or



 or at any time during the past three years was a partner or employee of the company&#146;s outside auditor
 and who worked on the company&#146;s audit.

 for professional services rendered for the audit and reviews of our financial statements.

 the parties expressly acknowledge that all fees paid to Consultant hereunder shall constitute consulting and or &#147;finder&#148;fees for its strategic advice and not for raising money for the Company; and that the services of Consultant described in this Consulting Agreement are not intended to engage Consultant to provide services as a broker or dealer of agent acting on behalf of the Company in any placement of securities.

 from and against any and all claims
 actions
 suits
 proceedings (including those of shareholders)
 damages
 liabilities and expenses incurred by any of them (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel)
 as incurred
 (collectively a &#147;Claim&#148;)
 that are (A) related to or arise out of (i) any actions taken or omitted to be taken (including any untrue statements made or any statements omitted to be made) by the Company
 or (ii) any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any Indemnified Person in connection with the Company&#146;s engagement of GenCap
 or (B) otherwise relate to or arise out of GenCap&#146; activities on the Company&#146;s behalf under GenCap&#146; engagement
 and the Company shall reimburse any Indemnified person for all expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) as incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating
 preparing or defending any such claim
 action
 suit or proceeding
 whether or not in connection with pending or threatened litigation in which any Indemnified Person is a party. The Company will not
 however
 be responsible for any Claim that is finally judicially determined to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any person seeking indemnification for such Claim. &nbsp;The Company further agrees that no Indemnified Person shall have any liability to the Company for or in connection with the Company&#146;s engagement of GenCap.

 without the prior written consent of GenCap
 settle
 compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened Claim in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not any indemnified Person is an actual or potential party to such Claim)
 unless such settlement
 compromise or consent includes an unconditional
 irrevocable release of each Indemnified Person from any and all liability arising out of such Claim.






 such Indemnified Person shall notify the Company in writing of such complaint or of such assertion or institution but failure to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company from any obligation it may have hereunder
 except and only to the extent such failure results in the forfeiture by the Company of substantial rights and defenses. &nbsp;If the Company so elects or is requested by such Indemnified Person
 the Company will assume the defense of such Claim
 including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person and the payment of the fees and expenses of such counsel. &nbsp;In the event
 however
 that legal counsel to such Indemnified Person reasonably determines that having common counsel would present such counsel with a conflict of interest or if the defendant in
 or target of
 any such Claim
 includes an Indemnified Person and the Company
 and legal counsel to such Indemnified Person reasonably concludes that there may be legal defenses available to it or other Indemnified Persons different from or in addition to those available to the Company
 then such Indemnified Person may employ its own separate counsel to represent or defend him
 her or it in any such Claim and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. &nbsp;Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary
 if the Company fails timely or diligently to defend
 contest
 or otherwise protect against any Claim

 but not the obligation
 to defend
 contest
 compromise
 settle
 assert crossclaims
 or counterclaims or otherwise protect against the same
 and shall be fully indemnified by the Company therefor
 including without limitation
 for the reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel and all amounts paid as a result of such Claim or the compromise or settlement thereof. &nbsp;In addition
 with respect to any Claim in which the Company assumes the defense
 the Indemnified Person shall have the right to participate in such Claim and to retain his
 her or its own counsel therefore at his
 her or its own expense.

 the Company and GenCap shall contribute to the Claim for which such indemnity is held unavailable in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits to the Company
 on the one hand
 and GenCap on the other
 in connection with GenCap&#146; engagement referred to above
 subject to the limitation that in no event shall the amount of GenCap&#146; contribution to such Claim exceed the amount of fees actually received by GenCap from the Company pursuant to GenCap&#146; engagement. &nbsp;The Company hereby agrees that the relative benefits to the Company
 on the one hand
 and GenCap on the other
 with respect to GenCap&#146; engagement shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as (a) the total value paid or proposed to be paid or received by the Company or its stockholders as the case may be
 pursuant to the Offering (whether or not consummated) for which GenCap is engaged to render services bears to (b) the fee paid or proposed to be paid to GenCap in connection with such engagement.

 reimbursement and contribution obligations under his Agreement (a) shall be in addition to
 and shall in no way limit or otherwise adversely affect any rights that any Indemnified Party may have at law or at equity and (b) shall be effective whether or not the Company is at fault in any way.





. &nbsp;The Company acknowledges that GenCap has been retained only by the Company
 that GenCap is providing services hereunder as an independent contractor (and not in any fiduciary or agency capacity) and that the Company&#146;s engagement of GenCap is not deemed to be on behalf of

 or his failure to fulfil any of his covenants or agreements under this Agreement.


 Subscriber acknowledges that we have relied upon the following representations and warranties of the Subscriber:



 except pursuant to sales that are exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and/or sales registered under the Securities Act. &nbsp;The Subscriber understands that Subscriber must bear the economic risk of this investment indefinitely
 unless the Securities are registered pursuant to the Securities Act and any applicable state securities or Blue Sky Laws or an exemption from such registration is available.



 sophisticated and experienced in making and is qualified to make decisions with respect to a variety of sophisticated and complex investments that present investment decisions like those involved in the purchase of the Securities. &nbsp;The Subscriber
 in reaching a decision to subscribe
 has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that the Subscriber is capable of reading
 interpreting and understanding financial statements and evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Securities and has the net worth to undertake such risks. Subscriber has invested in the common stock or other securities of companies comparable to us that involve non-trading
 and/or thinly traded securities and penny stocks
 unregistered securities
 restricted securities and high-risk investments. &nbsp;The Subscriber represents that in addition to Subscriber&#146;s own ability to evaluate an investment in the Securities
 the Subscriber has employed the services of an investment advisor
 attorney or accountant or other advisor to read all of the documents furnished or made available by us to the Subscriber
 to evaluate the merits and risks of such an investment on its behalf
 and that the Subscriber recognizes the highly speculative nature of an investment in the Securities
 and the Subscriber represents that he or she is familiar with our business operations and financial affairs and has been provided with all information pertaining to us it has requested.


 which are not readily marketable
 is not disproportionate to Subscriber&#146;s net worth
 and the investment in the Securities will not cause the Subscriber&#146;s overall investment in illiquid high-risk investments to become excessive in proportion to Subscriber&#146;s assets
 liabilities and living standards. &nbsp;The Subscriber can bear the economic risk of an investment in the Securities for an indefinite period of time and can bear a loss of the entire investment in the Securities without financial hardship or a change in its living conditions.



 oral or written
 by any person with respect to the future value of
 if any
 or the income from
 if any
 the Securities. Subscriber represents and represents that we have not represented
 guaranteed or warranted
 whether expressly or by implication
 that: (i) the Subscriber will realize any given percentage of profits and/or amount or type of consideration
 profit or loss as a result of our activities or the Subscriber&#146;s investment in the Securities; or (ii) our past performance or experience of our management
 or of any other person
 will in any way indicate predictable results regarding the ownership of our Securities
 the future value of the Securities
 or of our activities.


 schedules and reports filed with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;).


 and no oral or written information furnished to the Subscriber or the Subscriber&#146;s advisor(s) in connection with the Offering is in any way inconsistent with the information stated in this Subscription Agreement.

Subscriber acknowledges that it will have no control or ability to influence or participate in the determination of how the proceeds from this Offering will be utilized and the use of the proceeds by management cannot currently be predicted with any accuracy.



 in part
 upon the Subscriber&#146;s investment intention. &nbsp;In connection with this
 the Subscriber understands that it is the position of the SEC that the statutory basis for such exemption would not be present if the Subscriber&#146;s representation merely meant that its present intention was to hold the Securities for a short period
 such as the capital gains period of tax statutes
 for a deferred sale
 for a market rise
 assuming that a market develops
 or for any other fixed period. &nbsp;The Subscriber realizes that
 in the view of the SEC
 an investor who purchases the Securities with a present intent to resell the interest would not be purchasing for investment as required by SEC rules.



 and the Subscriber's compliance with
 the representations
 warranties
 agreements
 acknowledgments and understandings of the Subscriber set forth herein without limitation in order to determine the availability of such exemptions and the eligibility of the Subscriber to acquire the Securities.

 substance
 scope and law firm acceptable to us) to the effect that the Securities to be sold or transferred may be sold or transferred pursuant to an exemption from such registration; or (c) sold under and in compliance with Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act (or a successor rule) (&#147;Rule 144&#148;); or (d) sold or transferred in accordance with applicable securities laws to an affiliate of the Subscriber who agrees to sell or otherwise transfer the Securities only in accordance with the provisions of this Section; and we are not under any obligation to register the Securities under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. &nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else contained herein to the contrary
 the Securities may not be pledged as collateral in connection with a bona fide margin account or other lending arrangement
 unless such pledge is consistent with applicable laws
 rules and regulations and at our option
 the pledgor provides us with a legal opinion (which opinion shall be in form
 substance
 scope and law firm acceptable to us) that the pledge or other lending agreement is in compliance with applicable state and federal securities laws.


 as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;)

These accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern.&nbsp; As shown in the accompanying financial statements
 we have sustained losses from inception
 including net losses in excess of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31
 2014
 and have working capital and accumulated deficits that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.&nbsp; In response to these conditions
 we may raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity securities
 or through borrowings from financial institutions or individuals. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 




        
          

        
          
            

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    








        
          

        
          
            

 (b) the possible effects of such conditions and events
 (c) management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions and events and any mitigating factors
 (d) possible discontinuance of operations
 (e) management's plans (including relevant prospective financial information)
 and (f) information about the recoverability or classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts or classification of liabilities. If management's plans alleviate the substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern
 disclosure of the principal conditions and events that initially raised the substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern would be expected to be considered. Disclose whether operations for the current or prior years generated sufficient cash to cover current obligations
 whether waivers were obtained from creditors relating to the company's default under the provisions of debt agreements and possible effects of such conditions and events
 such as: whether there is a possible need to obtain additional financing (debt or equity) or to liquidate certain holdings to offset future cash flow deficiencies. Disclose appropriate parent company information when parent is dependent upon remittances from subsidiaries to satisfy its obligations.

&#160;Property and equipment are carried at the cost of acquisition or construction and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Costs associated with repair and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with improvements which extend the life
 increase the capacity or improve the efficiency of our property and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the related asset. Gains and losses on dispositions of equipment are reflected in operations. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets
 which are 7 to 13 years.

 bases of stating inventories (for example
 lower of cost or market)
 methods by which amounts are added and removed from inventory classes (for example
 FIFO
 LIFO
 or average cost)

 and situations in which inventories are stated above cost. If inventory is carried at cost
 this disclosure includes the nature of the cost elements included in inventory.
