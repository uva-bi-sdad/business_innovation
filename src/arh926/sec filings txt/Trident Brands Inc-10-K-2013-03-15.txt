ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL INFORMATION
You should read the following summary together with the more detailed business
information and the financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere
in this report. In this report
 unless the context otherwise denotes
 references
to we
 us
 our
 Sandfield and Sandfield Ventures are to Sandfield
Ventures Corp.
Sandfield Ventures Corp. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 5
2007 to engage in the acquisition
 exploration and development of natural
resource properties. The principal executive offices are located at Third Floor
Olde Towne Marina
 Nassau
 Bahamas. The telephone number is (888)593-0181.
We are an exploration stage company with no revenues and a limited operating
history. Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion which includes a
statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going
concern.
We have a total of 75
000
000 authorized common shares with a par value of
$0.001 per share and 7
000
000 common shares issued and outstanding as of
November 30
 2009.
We completed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 under the Securities Act of
1933 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission registering 4
000
000
shares at a price of $0.015 per share. The offering was completed for total
proceeds to the company of $60
000.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Phase 1 of the exploration program on the claims held by the company was
completed in April 2008. We received the results from the geologist and he
recommended that a fill-in sampling (Phase 1A) take place before the Phase 2
work was considered. This program entailed sampling about the anomalous
coincident concentrations of samples from Phase 1. The program required taking a
similar number of samples as taken in Phase 1
 but in a more detailed fashion
about the anomalies. The cost for this program was $10
500. The fieldwork was
completed and we received the results.
Based upon the geologist's recommendations we have abandoned further exploration
on the property. Our plan of operation for the next twelve months is to secure
another property on which we will carry out a new exploration program.
COMPETITION
Readily available commodities markets exist in the U.S. and around the world for
the sale of gold
 silver and other minerals. Therefore
 we will likely be able
to sell any minerals that we are able to recover.
                                       3

We will be subject to competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies in
the industry in the event spot shortages arise for supplies such as dynamite
and certain equipment such as bulldozers and excavators that we will need to
conduct exploration. If we are unsuccessful in securing the products
 equipment
and services we need we may have to suspend our future exploration plans until
we are able to do so.
BANKRUPTCY OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS
There has been no bankruptcy
 receivership or similar proceeding.
REORGANIZATIONS
 PURCHASE OR SALE OF ASSETS
There have been no material reclassifications
 mergers
 consolidations
 or
purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of
business.
COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Exploration programs in Nevada are subject to state and federal regulations
regarding environmental considerations. All operations involving the exploration
for the production of minerals are subject to existing laws and regulations
relating to exploration procedures
 safety precautions
 employee health and
safety
 air quality standards
 pollution of streams and fresh water sources
odor
 noise
 dust and other environmental protection controls adopted by
federal
 state and local governmental authorities as well as the rights of
adjoining property owners. We may be required to prepare and present to federal
state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any
proposed exploration for or production of minerals may have upon the
environment. All requirements imposed by any such authorities may be costly
time consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or
production operations. Future legislation may significantly emphasize the
protection of the environment
 and
 as a consequence
 our activities may be more
closely regulated to further the cause of environmental protection. Such
legislation
 as well as further interpretation of existing laws in the United
States
 may require substantial increases in equipment and operating costs and
delays
 interruptions
 or a termination of operations
 the extent of which
cannot be predicted. Environmental problems known to exist at this time in the
United States may not be in compliance with regulations that may come into
existence in the future. This may have a substantial impact upon the capital
expenditures required of us in order to deal with such problem and could
substantially reduce earnings.
The regulatory bodies that directly regulate our activities are the Bureau of
Land Management (Federal) and the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection
(State).
PATENTS
 TRADEMARKS
 FRANCHISES
 CONCESSIONS
 ROYALTY AGREEMENTS
 OR LABOR
CONTRACTS
We have no current plans for any registrations such as patents
 trademarks
copyrights
 franchises
 concessions
 royalty agreements or labor contracts. We
will assess the need for any copyright
 trademark or patent applications on an
ongoing basis.
                                       4

NEED FOR GOVERNMENT APPROVAL FOR ITS PRODUCTS OR SERVICES
We are not required to apply for or have any government approval for our
products or services.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS
We have not expended funds for research and development costs since inception.
We paid $3
500 for the geology report and $3
500 for the staking of the claims
and incurred an additional $17
540 in exploration costs.
EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS
Our only employee is our sole officer
 Mark Holcombe. Mr. Holcombe currently
devotes 2-4 hours per week to company matters and after receiving funding he
plans to devote as much time as the board of directors determines is necessary
to manage the affairs of the company. There are no formal employment agreements
between the company and our current employee.
REPORTS TO SECURITIES HOLDERS
We provide an annual report that includes audited financial information to our
shareholders. We will make our financial information equally available to any
interested parties or investors through compliance with the disclosure rules of
Regulation S-K for a small business issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. We are subject to disclosure filing requirements
 including filing Form
10K annually and Form 10Q quarterly. In addition
 we will file Form 8K and other
proxy and information statements from time to time as required. We do not intend
to voluntarily file the above reports in the event that our obligation to file
such reports is suspended under the Exchange Act. The public may read and copy
any materials that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission
 (SEC)
at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street NE
 Washington
 DC 20549. The
public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by
calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site
(http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports
 proxy and information statements
and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
WE ARE AN EXPLORATION STAGE COMPANY AND EXPECT TO INCUR OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE
FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
     We completed the preliminary phases of the exploration program on the Git
     1-4 Mineral Claims and have abandoned the claims. We are currently are in
     search of a new property for exploration. We were incorporated on November
     5
 2007 and to date have been involved primarily in organizational
     activities
 the acquisition of the mineral claims and the first phases of
     exploration. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties
     normally encountered by new mineral exploration companies and the high rate
     of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be
     considered in light of the problems
 expenses
 difficulties
 complications
     and delays encountered in connection with the exploration of the mineral
                                       5

     properties that we plan to undertake. These potential problems include
 but
     are not limited to
 unanticipated problems relating to exploration
 and
     additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. We
     anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without
     realizing any revenues. We recognize that if we are unable to generate
     significant revenues from development and production of minerals
 we will
     not be able to earn profits or continue operations. There is no history
     upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove
     successful
 and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues
     or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing
     these risks
 our business will most likely fail.
OUR INDEPENDENT AUDITOR HAS ISSUED AN AUDIT OPINION FOR SANDFIELD VENTURES WHICH
INCLUDES A STATEMENT DESCRIBING OUR GOING CONCERN STATUS. OUR FINANCIAL STATUS
CREATES A DOUBT WHETHER WE WILL CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.
     As described in Note 4 of our accompanying financial statements
 our lack
     of operations and any guaranteed sources of future capital create
     substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. If our
     business plan does not work
 we could remain as a start-up company with
     limited operations and revenues.
WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY ADVANCE ANY
MINERAL CLAIM INTO COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION IF MINERALIZATION IS FOUND.
     Our ability to generate revenues and profits is expected to occur through
     exploration
 development and production of a mineral claim. Substantial
     expenditures will be incurred in an attempt to establish the economic
     feasibility of mining operations by identifying mineral deposits and
     establishing ore reserves through drilling and other techniques
 developing
     metallurgical processes to extract metals from ore
 designing facilities
     and planning mining operations. The economic feasibility of a project
     depends on numerous factors
 including the cost of mining and production
     facilities required to extract the desired minerals
 the total mineral
     deposits that can be mined using a given facility
 the proximity of the
     mineral deposits to a user of the minerals
 and the market price of the
     minerals at the time of sale. There is no assurance that an exploration
     program will result in the identification of deposits that can be mined
     profitably.
     If an exploration program is successful in establishing ore of commercial
     tonnage and grade
 we will require additional funds in order to advance the
     claims into commercial production. Obtaining additional financing would be
     subject to a number of factors
 including the market price for the
     minerals
 investor acceptance of our claims and general market conditions.
     These factors may make the timing
 amount
 terms or conditions of
     additional financing unavailable to us. The most likely source of future
     funds is through the sale of equity capital. Any sale of share capital will
     result in dilution to existing shareholders. We may be unable to obtain any
     such funds
 or to obtain such funds on terms that we consider economically
     feasible
GOVERNMENT REGULATION OR OTHER LEGAL UNCERTAINTIES MAY INCREASE COSTS AND OUR
BUSINESS WILL BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.
                                       6

     Laws and regulations govern the exploration
 development
 mining
     production
 importing and exporting of minerals; taxes; labor standards;
     occupational health; waste disposal; protection of the environment; mine
     safety; toxic substances; and other matters. In many cases
 licenses and
     permits are required to conduct mining operations. Amendments to current
     laws and regulations governing operations and activities of mining
     companies or more stringent implementation thereof could have a substantial
     adverse impact on us. Applicable laws and regulations will require us to
     make certain capital and operating expenditures to initiate new operations.
     Under certain circumstances
 we may be required to stop exploration
     activities once they are started until a particular problem is remedied or
     to undertake other remedial actions.
THE MINING INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL RISKS.
     The mining industry
 from exploration
 development and production is a
     speculative business
 characterized by a number of significant risks
     including
 among other things
 unprofitable efforts resulting not only from
     the failure to discover mineral deposits but from finding mineral deposits
     which
 though present
 are insufficient in quantity and quality to return a
     profit from production. The marketability of minerals acquired or
     discovered may be affected by numerous factors which are beyond our control
     and which cannot be accurately predicted
 such as market fluctuations
 the
     proximity and capacity of milling facilities
 mineral markets and
     processing equipment
 and government regulations
 including regulations
     relating to royalties
 allowable production
 importing and exporting of
     minerals
 and environmental protection. The combination of such factors may
     result in our not receiving an adequate return on investment capital.
BECAUSE OUR CURRENT OFFICER AND DIRECTOR HAS OTHER BUSINESS INTERESTS
 HE MAY
NOT BE ABLE OR WILLING TO DEVOTE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF TIME TO OUR BUSINESS
OPERATIONS
 CAUSING OUR BUSINESS TO FAIL.
     Mr. Mark Holcombe
 our sole officer and director of the company
 currently
     devotes approximately 2-4 hours per week providing management services to
     us. While he presently possesses adequate time to attend to our interests
     it is possible that the demands on him from his other obligations could
     increase
 with the result that he would no longer be able to devote
     sufficient time to the management of our business. This could negatively
     impact our business development.
ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
None.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
We do not currently own any property. Our director Mr. Holcombe currently
provides us with office space at Third Floor
 Olde Towne Marina
 Nassau
Bahamas. The facilities include answering services
 fax services
 secretarial
services
 reception area and offices. Management believes the current premises
are sufficient for its needs at this time. During the year ended November 30
2012 we paid Mr. Holcombe a total of $4
800 in rental fees.
                                       7

We currently have no investment policies as they pertain to real estate
 real
estate interests or real estate mortgages.
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We are not currently involved in any legal proceedings and we are not aware of
any pending or potential legal actions.
ITEM 4. MINING SAFETY DISCLOSURES
None.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY
 RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER
        PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
On February 13
 2009 our shares were approved for trading on the OTC Electronic
Bulletin Board (OTCBB) under the symbol TAEI. As of the date of this filing
there has been no active trading of our securities
 and
 therefore
 no high and
low bid pricing.
The OTCBB is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes
 last
sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter (OTC) securities. The
OTCBB is not an issuer listing service
 market or exchange. Although the OTCBB
does not have any listing requirements per se
 to be eligible for quotation on
the OTCBB
 issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC or
applicable regulatory authority. Market Makers are not permitted to begin
quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement.
Securities already quoted on the OTCBB that become delinquent in their required
filings will be removed following a 30 or 60 day grace period if they do not
make their required filing during that time.
As of November 30
 2011
 we have 7
000
000 Shares of $0.001 par value common
stock issued and outstanding held by 28 shareholders of record.
Of the 7
000
000 shares of common stock outstanding as of November 30
 2011
3
000
000 shares are owned by Mark Holcombe
 our officer and director

000
000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1

000 jointly with their spouses). For
transactions covered by the Rule

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We are still in our exploration stage and have generated no revenues to date.
We incurred operating expenses of $18
848 and $16
767 for the years ended
November 30
 2012 and 2011
 respectively. These expenses consisted of $7
800
(11/30/12) and $7
500 (11/30/11) in professional fees
 $5
314 (11/30/12) and
$2
919 (11/30/11) in general and administrative expenses
 $4
800 (11/30/12) and
$6
000 (11/30/11) in rent and $933 (11/30/12) and $348 (11/30/11) in interest
expense. During the year ended November 30
 2012 we realized a Gain on Note
Payable Forgiveness of $21
281.
Our net loss from inception (November 5
 2007) through November 30
 2012 was
$80
297.
We have sold $75
000 in equity securities to date. We sold $15
000 in equity
securities to our officer and director and $60
000 to independent investors.
The following table provides selected financial data about our company for the
years ended November 30
 2012 and 2011.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our cash balance at November 30
 2012 was $4
503. Management believes the
current funds available to the company and loans from our director will fund our
operations for the next twelve months. We are an exploration stage company and
have generated no revenue to date.
GOING CONCERN
The accompanying financial statements are presented on a going concern basis.
The Company had limited operations during the period from November 5
 2007 (date
of inception) to November 30
 2012 and generated a net loss of $80
731. This
condition raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern. Because the Company is currently in the exploration stage and has
minimal expenses
 management believes that the company's current cash and cash
equivalents of $4
503 and loans from our director is sufficient to cover the
expenses they will incur during the next twelve months in a limited operations
scenario or until they raise additional funding.
                                       10

PLAN OF OPERATION
Phase 1 of the exploration program on the claims held by the company was
completed in April 2008. We received the results from the geologist and he
recommended that a fill-in sampling (Phase 1A) take place before the Phase 2
work was considered. This program entailed sampling about the anomalous
coincident concentrations of samples from Phase 1. The program required taking a
similar number of samples as taken in Phase 1
 but in a more detailed fashion
about the anomalies. The cost for this program was $10
500. The fieldwork was
completed and we received the results.
Based upon the geologist's recommendations we have abandoned further exploration
on the property. We are currently searching for another property on which we
will carry out a new exploration program.
Our plan of operation for the next twelve months is to secure another property
on which we will carry out a new exploration program. Total expenditures over
the next 12 months are expected to be approximately $20
000.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably
likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition
 changes in
financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors
Sandfield Ventures Corp.
I have audited the  accompanying  balance sheet of Sandfield  Ventures Corp. (An
Exploration  Stage  Company)  as of November  30
  2012 & 2011
  and the related
statement  of  operations
  stockholders'  equity  and cash flows for years then
ended and the period from  November 5
 2007  (inception)
  to November 30
 2012.
These financial  statements are the responsibility of the Company's  management.
My responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based
on my audit.
I conducted my audit in  accordance  with the  standards  of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that I plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining
 on a
test basis
  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management
  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial statement presentation.  I believe that my audit provides a reasonable
basis for my opinion.
In my opinion
 the financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all
material  respects
  the financial  position of Sandfield  Ventures  Corp.
  (An
Exploration  Stage Company) as of November 30
 2012 and 2011
 and the results of
its operations and cash flows for the years then ended and from November 5
 2007
(inception)
  to  November  30
  2012  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America.
The accompanying  financial  statements have been prepared  assuming the Company
will  continue as a going  concern.  As discussed  in Note # 4 to the  financial
statements
  the Company has had no operations and has no established  source of
revenue.  This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern.  Management's plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note
# 4. The financial  statements do not include any adjustments  that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty.

                          Notes to Financial Statements
                                November 30
 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Sandfield  Ventures Corp. (the Company) was  incorporated  under the laws of the
State of Nevada on  November  5
 2007.  The  Company was formed to engage in the
acquisition
 exploration and development of natural resource properties.
The  Company  is in the  exploration  stage.  Its  activities  to date have been
limited to capital formation
 organization
 development of its business plan and
has completed the first two stages of its exploration program.
NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The Company's  financial  statements  are prepared  using the accrual  method of
accounting. The Company has elected a November 30
 year-end.
BASIC EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE
ASC No. 260
 Earnings Per Share
  specifies the computation
  presentation and
disclosure requirements for earnings (loss) per share for entities with publicly
held common stock. The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC No. 260.
Basic net  earnings  (loss) per share  amounts is computed  by dividing  the net
earnings  (loss) by the weighted  average  number of common shares  outstanding.
Diluted  earnings  (loss)  per share are the same as basic  earnings  (loss) per
share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company.
CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid  investments  purchased with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and
the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses  during the  reporting  period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. In accordance with ASC No. 250
all adjustments are normal and recurring.

                         (An Exploration Stage Company)
                          Notes to Financial Statements
                                November 30
 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are provided in accordance with ASC No. 740
  Accounting for Income
Taxes.  A  deferred  tax  asset  or  liability  is  recorded  for all  temporary
differences   between  financial  and  tax  reporting  and  net  operating  loss
carryforwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during
the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when
 in the opinion of
management
  it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred
tax assets will be realized.  Deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are adjusted
for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
REVENUE
The Company  records  revenue on the accrual  basis when all goods and  services
have been performed and  delivered
  the amounts are readily  determinable
  and
collection  is  reasonably  assured.  The Company has not  generated any revenue
since its inception.
ADVERTISING
The  Company  will  expense its  advertising  when  incurred.  There has been no
advertising since inception.
NOTE 3. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUCEMENTS
The Company has evaluated all the recent accounting  pronouncements  through the
date the  financial  statements  were issued and filed with the  Securities  and
Exchange Commission and believe that none of them will have a material effect on
the Company's financial statements.
NOTE 4. GOING CONCERN
The  accompanying  financial  statements are presented on a going concern basis.
The Company had no  operations  during the period from November 5
 2007 (date of
inception)  to  November  30
 2012 and  generated  a net loss of  $80
297.  This
condition raises  substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern. The Company is currently in the exploration stage and has minimal
expenses
 however
 management believes that the company's current cash of $4
503
is  insufficient  to cover the  expenses  they will incur during the next twelve
months.
NOTE 5. WARRANTS AND OPTIONS
There are no warrants or options outstanding to acquire any additional shares of
common.

1
 2009 and August 31
 2009 and the month of  September  2012 the Company paid a
director $300 per month for use of office space and services.  Between September
1

The sole officer and director of the Company may
 in the future

 he may face a conflict
in  selecting  between  the Company and his other  business  opportunities.  The
Company has not formulated a policy for the resolution of such conflicts.
NOTE 7. INCOME TAXES

Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon  sufficient  future taxable
income during the period that deductible temporary differences and carryforwards
are expected to be available to reduce  taxable  income.  As the  achievement of
required  future taxable income is uncertain
  the Company  recorded a valuation
allowance.

ITEM 9A (T). CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including
our principal executive officer and the principal financial officer (our
president)
 we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934
 as of the
end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation
 our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the
evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such
that the material information required to be included in our Securities and
Exchange Commission reports is accumulated and communicated to our management
including our principal executive and financial officer
 recorded
 processed
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms
relating to our company
 particularly during the period when this report was
being prepared.
MANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting
 as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act
 for the Company. Internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles
 and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition
 use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.
Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness
of any system of internal control
 and accordingly
 even effective internal
control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and may not prevent or detect material misstatements. In
addition
 effective internal control at a point in time may become ineffective
in future periods because of changes in conditions or due to deterioration in
the degree of compliance with our established policies and procedures.
A material weakness is a significant deficiency
 or combination of significant
deficiencies
 that results in there being a more than remote likelihood that a
material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be
prevented or detected.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer
 management conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
 as of the
                                       21

Evaluation Date
 based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Based on its evaluation under this framework
 management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective
as of the Evaluation Date.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting as of Evaluation Date and identified the following material
weaknesses:
INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES: We have an inadequate number of personnel with requisite
expertise in the key functional areas of finance and accounting.
INADEQUATE SEGREGATION OF DUTIES: We have an inadequate number of personnel to
properly implement control procedures.
LACK OF AUDIT COMMITTEE & OUTSIDE DIRECTORS ON THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS:
We do not have a functioning audit committee or outside directors on the
Company's Board of Directors
 resulting in ineffective oversight in the
establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures.
Management is committed to improving its internal controls and will (1) continue
to use third party specialists to address shortfalls in staffing and to assist
the Company with accounting and finance responsibilities
 (2) increase the
frequency of independent reconciliations of significant accounts which will
mitigate the lack of segregation of duties until there are sufficient personnel
and (3) may consider appointing outside directors and audit committee members in
the future.
Management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
has discussed the material weakness noted above with our independent registered
public accounting firm. Due to the nature of this material weakness
 there is a
more than remote likelihood that misstatements which could be material to the
annual or interim financial statements could occur that would not be prevented
or detected.
This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered
public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
Management's report was not subject to attestation by the our registered public
accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide
only management's report in this annual report.
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during the last fiscal quarter for our fiscal year ended November 30
2012 that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially
affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

 including costs of drilling exploratory wells and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells. Exploration costs may be incurred both before acquiring the related property (sometimes referred to in part as prospecting costs) and after acquiring the property. Principal types of exploration costs
 which include depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of exploration activities
 are: costs of topographical
 geographical and geophysical studies
 rights of access to properties to conduct those studies
 and salaries and other expenses of geologists
 geophysical crews
 and others conducting those studies. Collectively
 these are sometimes referred to as geological and geophysical or G&amp;G costs. Exploration costs also include costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties
 such as delay rentals
 ad valorem taxes on properties
 legal costs for title defense
 the maintenance of land and lease records
 dry hole contributions and bottom hole contributions
 costs of drilling and equipping exploratory wells and costs of drilling exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells.

The Company records revenue on the accrual basis when all goods and services have been performed and delivered
 the amounts are readily determinable
 and collection is reasonably assured. &nbsp;The Company has not generated any revenue since its inception.




        
          

        
          
            

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    








        
          

        
          
            

 the policy for each material type of transaction is generally disclosed. If a sales transaction has multiple element arrangements (for example
 delivery of multiple products
 services or the rights to use assets) the disclosure may indicate the accounting policy for each unit of accounting as well as how units of accounting are determined and valued. The disclosure may encompass important judgment as to appropriateness of principles related to recognition of revenue. The disclosure also may indicate the entity's treatment of any unearned or deferred revenue that arises from the transaction.
