Certain statements made in this Annual
Report involve known and unknown risks
 uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results
 performance or achievements
to be materially different from any future results
 performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties.
Our plans and objectives are based
 in part
 on assumptions involving judgments with respect to
 among other things
 future economic
competitive and market conditions
 technological developments related to business support services and outsourced business processes
and future business decisions
 all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our
control.

Although we believe that our
assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable
 any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and
therefore
 there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this report will prove to be accurate.
In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein particularly in view of
the current state of our operations
 the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a statement by us or any
other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements include
 but are not limited to
 the factors set forth
herein under the headings &ldquo;Business
&rdquo; and &ldquo;Risk Factors&rdquo;




 Inc. (&ldquo;we&rdquo;
&ldquo;us&rdquo; &ldquo;the Company&rdquo; or &ldquo;Nightfood&rdquo;) is a Nevada corporation organized on October 16
 2013 to
acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Nightfood
 Inc.
 a New York corporation (&ldquo;Nightfood&rdquo;) from its
sole shareholder
 Sean Folkson. All of our operations are conducted by the Subsidiary. We are in the business of manufacturing
marketing and distributing snacks specially formulated and promoted for evening consumption. A large number of Americans consume
nighttime snacks that are high in sugar
 fat
 sodium
 and calories; such snacks can impair sleep and also impair health in general.
Management believes that our products are unique in the food industry and that there is a substantial market for our products.
Our corporate address is 520 White Plains Road &ndash; Suite 500
 Tarrytown
 New York 10591 and our telephone number is 888-888-6444.
We maintain a web site at www.Nightfood.com
 along with many additional web properties. Any information that may appear on our
web site should not be deemed to be a part of this report.


 2018
 the Registrant formed
a new wholly-owned subsidiary to capitalize on opportunities in the marijuana and cbd edibles space. MJ Munchies
 Inc. (&ldquo;Munchies&rdquo;)
was formed as a Nevada corporation with a capital structure of 10
000 shares of common stock. Since formation
 Munchies has built
an intellectual property portfolio that includes a registered trademark for Half-Baked in the State of California relating to
marijuana edibles
 a pending federal trademark application with the USPTO for Half-Baked relating to packaged snacks
 the federal
trademark for The Half Baked Cookie Co.
 HalfBaked.com
 and several other related domain names.




seeking to establish a market within the snack industry by offering a line of snack foods that are specifically formulated for
evening consumption. It is estimated that American consumers spend over $50 Billion annually on snacks consumed at night
 and
this figure continues to grow. Moreover
 industry data indicates that the most popular nighttime snack choices include products
and categories that are traditionally considered high in calories
 and &ldquo;unhealthy&rdquo; options
 such as cookies
 salty
snacks (chips
 pretzels
 and popcorn)
 ice cream
 and candy.

companies
 each serving a different market segment with different products.

MJ Munchies
 Inc.


 Inc. is a Nevada corporation
formed in January of 2018 to exploit legally compliant opportunities in the CBD and marijuana edibles and related spaces. The
Company intends to market some of these new products under the brand name &ldquo;Half-Baked&rdquo;. This subsidiary was created
during the three months ended March 31
 2018 and its operations have a nominal impact on the financial statements contained herein.


 MJ Munchies has applied
for U.S. Trademark protection for its brand of Half-Baked snacks
 currently under development. MJ Munchies also acquired HalfBaked.com.
In April
 2018
 MJ Munchies entered into an initial brand licensing agreement for the Half-Baked mark with a licensed manufacturer
of THC-infused edibles in the State of California under which
 the licensee manufactured and distributed a small pilot run of
Half-Baked branded THC-infused cookies in California. Management continues to seek a suitable licensing partner for the intellectual
property the Company has secured.


currently exist to launch successful and legally compliant products in this space
 and that such opportunities will continue to
grow over time. No assurance can be given that the patent will be granted
 that it will afford meaningful protection to us if
granted
 or that we will begin actual production of products using the Half-Baked trademark. Even if production begins
 we can
neither assure market acceptance of our products nor that THC infused edibles will not face ongoing legal challenges.

Nightfood
 Inc.


 Inc. is a snack company focused
on manufacturing and distribution of ice cream that is formulated to be more appropriate for nighttime consumption. Nightfood&rsquo;s
initial line of products
 Nightfood nutrition bars
 are currently being phased out with the focus shifting to the national ice
cream rollout.


in eight flavors to date. These are Full Moon Vanilla
 Midnight Chocolate
 Cold Brew Decaf
 After Dinner Mint Chip
 Milk &amp;
Cookie Dough
 Cherry Eclipse
 Bed and Breakfast
 and Cookies n&rsquo; Dreams. Additional flavors have been developed
 both dairy
and non-dairy
 for introduction in 2020 based on retailer demand. In addition
 the Company has partnered with celebrities to manufacture
and distribute custom flavors. The celebrity partners are Michael Clifford
 guitarist of the award-winning
 multi-platinum band
5 Seconds of Summer
 and Richard Sherman
 NFL star who plays for the San Francisco 49ers. These celebrity flavors are in various
stages of development at the time of this filing
 and Management anticipates both to be on shelf in spring of 2020.


for better nighttime snacking options
 and that a new consumer category consisting of nighttime specific snacks will emerge in
the coming years. This belief is supported by research from major consumer goods research firms such as IRI Worldwide
 and Mintel
who identified nighttime specific foods and beverages as one of the &ldquo;most compelling and category changing trends&rdquo;
for 2017 and beyond.


is spent annually in the United States on snacks that are consumed between dinner and bed. Company management believes that a
significant percentage of that consumer spend will move from conventional snacks to nighttime specific snacks in coming years.


Advisory Board consisting of sleep and nutrition experts to drive product formulation decisions
 and provide consumer confidence
in the brand promise. The first member of this advisory board was Dr. Michael Grandner
 Director of the Sleep and Health Research
Program at the University of Arizona. Dr. Grandner has been conducting research on the link between nutrition and sleep for over
ten years
 and he believes improved nighttime nutritional choices can improve sleep
 resulting in many short and long-term health
benefits. In March of 2018
 the Company added Dr. Michael Breus to their Scientific Advisory Board. Breus
 known to millions as
The Sleep Doctor&trade;
 is believed to be the Nation&rsquo;s most trusted authority on sleep. He regularly appears in the national
media to educate and inform consumers so they can sleep better and lead happier
 healthier
 more productive lives. In July
 2018
we completed our Scientific Advisory Board with the addition of Lauren Broch
 Ph.D
 M.S. Dr. Broch is a sleep therapist and former
Director of Eductation &amp; Training at the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center at Weill Cornell Medical College. Uniquely
 Dr. Broch
also has a master&rsquo;s degree in human nutrition. This unique combination allowed her to play an important role in the reformulation
of our nutrition bars
 and the development of Nightfood ice cream. These experts work with Company management to ensure Nightfood
products deliver on their nighttime-appropriate
 and sleep-friendly promises.


    
    





 we have utilized contract manufacturers
for producing our products
 packaging for our products
 and 3rd party logistics for warehousing and order fulfillment. Our current
ice cream co-packer has capacity to manufacture approximately 400
000 pints of ice cream monthly. Management has had initial conversations
with other manufacturing facilities to establish additional production capacity as it becomes necessary.

 Woodman&rsquo;s
 Lowes Foods
 and Harris Teeter. The product line has garnered
extensive media interest from outlets such as Oprah Magazine
 USA Today
 The Wall Street Journal
 The Washington Post
 and more.
Consumers seem very enthusiastic about the prospect of a sleep-friendly ice cream. Management is working with these retail partners
on various marketing and promotional campaigns to drive trial and repeat purchase at the store level.




highly competitive and includes such participants as large companies like Mondelez
 Nestle S.A. and Quaker Oats and more specialized
companies such as Cliff Bar
 Quest Nutrition and many smaller companies. Many of these competitors have well established names
and products. Nestle recently announced an interest in the nighttime snacking space with the introduction of a candy-type product
called GoodNight. We will initially compete based upon the unique nature of our product. However
 other companies
 including those
with greater name recognition than us and greater resources may seek to introduce products that directly compete with our products.
Management believes that if a competitor sought to develop a competing product
 it could do so and begin to establish retail distribution
in 12-24 months. Based on the current acquisition climate in the consumer goods space
 Management believes that successful growth
of the Nightfood ice cream line would likely bring acquisition offers from potential competitors before it would actually bring
competition on the shelf from those same potential competitors.




for the nutrition bar/snack/meal replacement category
 and have applied for registration for the same mark for ice cream. While
this process will take several months
 management believes the mark will be granted in due time with no concerns or issues. We
believe these marks will prove important to our business. Additionally
 we own the domain Nightfood.com as well as many other
relevant domains such as late-night-snack.com

 Nightfood has dozens of people contributing
to our operations and efforts on a regular basis. Should we be successful in executing our business plan

additional employees in the future to assist with various company functions. However
 we also expect to continue to strategically

 sales were concentrated among
a handful of customers that each accounted for over 10% of our revenue. We expect this type of revenue concentration to continue
as our business model involves selling large quantities of ice cream wholesale to large accounts (major supermarket chains

distribution organizations)
 who then sell to the consumer. With more widespread distribution
 the concentration would decrease
to some extent.

may seek to duplicate the perceived benefits of our products in ways that do not infringe on any proprietary rights that we can

of other companies under which we have no control. We cannot promise that we can accomplish our marketing goals and as a result
may experience negative impact upon our operating results.

We may be exposed to potential risks

Act of 2002
 we are required to include in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year. We have not yet completed our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting. We would incur additional expenses and diversion of management&rsquo;s time as a result of performing

We do not have a sufficient number

 Sean Folkson to perform
all executive functions. Accordingly
 we cannot segregate duties to provide sufficient review of our financial activity. During
the course of our testing of our financial procedures
 we may identify other deficiencies that we may not be able to remediate
in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. In addition
if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls
 as such standards are modified
 supplemented or amended
from time to time
 we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls
over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover
 effective internal controls
 particularly
those related to revenue recognition
 are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent
financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud
 our business and operating results could be
harmed
 investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information
 and the trading price of our common stock could
drop significantly. Our officers&rsquo; lack of experience in accounting and financial matters may make our efforts to comply
more difficult and cause us to hire consultants to assist him cutting into our resources.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth
Company. 
 we qualify as an &ldquo;emerging
growth company&rdquo; as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as a company is deemed to be an emerging growth company
 it may
take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other regulatory requirements that are generally unavailable to other public
companies. These provisions include:


a
                                         requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years
                                         of related Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis included in an initial public offering

                                         offering registration statement;



an
                                         exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging
                                         growth company&rsquo;s internal controls over financial reporting;



an
                                         exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they
                                         would apply to private companies;



an
                                         exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting
                                         Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor&rsquo;s
                                         report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about

from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley which requires that the registered accounting firm shall
 in the same report
 attest to
and report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. Similarly
as a Smaller Reporting Company we are exempt from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and our independent registered public
accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
until such time as we cease being a Smaller Reporting Company.


 we are
exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval of executive
compensation and golden parachutes.


an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words
 an emerging growth company can delay the adoption
of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage
of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies
that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.

 2015 we began trading
under the Symbol NGTF on the OTC Markets. There had been very little trading activity of our stock for some time. In April of
2017
 the Company listing moved to the OTCQB
 and in August of 2017 an investor awareness campaign was initiated to communicate
news of recent company developments and milestones to a broader range of stock market investors. On October 23
 2017
 we were
advised that our stock had been moved from the OTCQB to the OTCPink marketplace. The Company did not believe the change in OTC
Market tiers had any material positive or negative impact on Company operations or the stock price. However
 in January
 2019
we determined that it was in the interest of our shareholders to be on the OTCQB and were reinstated on February 11
 2019. Trading
volume has increased significantly in the last eighteen months
 but there can be no assurances that it will be maintained. Our
stock is likely to continue to be subject to significant price fluctuations.


 our common stock is unlikely
to be followed by any market analysts
 and there may be few institutions acting as market makers for the common stock. Either
of these factors could adversely affect the liquidity and trading price of our common stock. Until our common stock is fully distributed
and an orderly market develops in our common stock
 if ever
 the price at which it trades is likely to fluctuate significantly.
Prices for our common stock will be determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors
 including the depth and
liquidity of the market for shares of our common stock
 developments affecting our business

 investor perception
 and general economic and market conditions. No assurances can
be given that an orderly or liquid market will ever develop for the shares of our common stock. Because of the anticipated low
price of the securities
 many brokerage firms may not be willing to effect transactions in these securities. Any purchasers of
our securities should be aware that any market that develops in our stock will likely be subject to the penny stock restrictions.&rdquo;

a Certificated of Designation for a class of preferred stock designated Class A Super Voting Preferred Stock (&ldquo;A Stock&rdquo;).
There are 10

 we have not issued any other shares of preferred stock and have
no plans to do so. Our preferred stock may bear such rights and preferences
 including dividend and liquidation preferences

the Board of Directors may fix and determine from time to time. Any such preferences may operate to the detriment of the rights

Our articles of incorporation provide
for indemnification of officers and directors at our expense and limit their liability that may result in a major cost to us and
hurt the interests of our shareholders because corporate resources may be expended for the benefit of officers and/or directors.

which they become a party arising from their association with or activities on our behalf. This indemnification policy could result
in substantial expenditures by us
 which we will be unable to recoup.


 in the opinion
of the SEC
 indemnification for liabilities arising under federal securities laws is against public policy as expressed in the
Securities Act of 1933 and is
 therefore
 unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against these types of
liabilities
 other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by a director
 officer or controlling person in the successful
defense of any action
 suit or proceeding
 is asserted by a director
 officer or controlling person in connection with the securities
being registered
 we will (unless in the opinion of our counsel
 the matter has been settled by controlling precedent) submit
to a court of appropriate jurisdiction
 the question whether indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the
Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. The legal process relating to this matter if it were
to occur is likely to be very costly and may result in us receiving negative publicity
 either of these factors would likely materially
reduce the market and price for our shares

 2005) establishes the definition of a &ldquo;penny stock
&rdquo; for purposes relevant to us
 as
any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share
subject to a limited number of exceptions. It is likely that our shares will be considered to be penny stocks for the immediately
foreseeable future. This classification severely and adversely affects the market liquidity for our common stock. For any transaction
involving a penny stock
 unless exempt
 the penny stock rules require that a broker or dealer approve a person&rsquo;s account
for transactions in penny stocks and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction setting
forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.


for transactions in penny stocks
 the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and investment experience and objectives
of the person and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and that
person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny
stocks.


prior to any transaction in a penny stock

in highlight form
 sets forth:

 and



that
                                         the broker or dealer received a signed

in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally
 monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information
for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.


 broker-dealers
may not wish to engage in the above-referenced necessary paperwork and disclosures and/or may encounter difficulties in their
attempt to sell shares of our common stock
 which may affect the ability of selling shareholders or other holders to sell their
shares in the secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market. These additional
sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our securities
 if and when our securities become publicly
traded. In addition
 the liquidity for our securities may decrease
 with a corresponding decrease in the price of our securities.
Our shares in all probability will be subject to such penny stock rules for the foreseeable future and our shareholders will
in all likelihood
 find it difficult to sell their securities. Recently
 several brokerage firms and clearing firms have adopted
special &ldquo;house rules&rdquo; which make it more difficult for their customers to hold or trade low priced stock and these
rules may make it difficult for our shareholders to sell their stock.

 to provide funds for the implementation of our
business plan. We do not intend to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore
 there can be no assurance
that holders of our common stock will receive any additional cash
 stock or other dividends on their shares of our common stock

568 of the outstanding
shares of our common stock are &ldquo;restricted securities&rdquo; within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of
1933
 as amended. As restricted shares
 these shares may be resold only pursuant to an effective registration statement or under
the requirements of Rule 144 or other applicable exemptions from registration under the Act and as required under applicable state
securities laws. Rule 144 provides in essence that a person who has held restricted securities for a prescribed period may
 under
certain conditions
 sell their shares as a result of revisions to Rule 144 which became effective on or about February 15
 2008
there is no limit on the amount of restricted securities that may be sold by a non-affiliate (i.e.
 a stockholder who has not
been an officer
 director or control person for at least 90 consecutive days) after the restricted securities have been held by
the owner for a period of six months. A sale under Rule 144 or under any other exemption from the Act
 if available
 or pursuant
to registration of shares of common stock of present stockholders
 may have a depressive effect upon the price of the common stock
in any market that may develop.

Any trading market that may develop
may be restricted by virtue of state securities &ldquo;Blue Sky&rdquo; laws to the extent they prohibit trading absent compliance
with individual state laws. These restrictions may make it difficult or impossible to sell shares in those states. Although trading
activity in our stock has increased recently

 and there can
be no assurance that an active and regular public market will develop in the foreseeable future. Transfer of our common stock
may also be restricted under the securities or securities regulations laws promulgated by various states and foreign jurisdictions
commonly referred to as &ldquo;Blue Sky&rdquo; laws. Absent compliance with such individual state laws
 our common stock may not
be traded in such jurisdictions. Because our securities have not been registered for resale under the &ldquo;Blue Sky&rdquo; laws
of any state
 the holders of such shares and persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the
future
 should be aware that there may be significant state &ldquo;Blue Sky&rdquo; law restrictions upon the ability of investors
to sell the securities and of purchasers to purchase the securities. These restrictions prohibit the secondary trading of our
common stock. Accordingly
 investors should consider the secondary market for our securities to be a limited one.&nbsp;

in &ldquo;penny stocks.&rdquo; Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities
registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system
 provided that current price and volume information
with respect to transactions in those securities is provided by the exchange or system). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer
prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules
 deliver a standardized risk disclosure document
prepared by the SEC
 which contains the following:



    
    
a description of
    the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading;

    
    
    

    
    
a description of
    the broker&rsquo;s or dealer&rsquo;s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with
    respect to violation to such duties or other requirements of securities&rsquo; laws;

    
    
    

    
    
a brief
 clear
    narrative description of a dealer market
 including &ldquo;bid&rdquo; and &ldquo;ask&rdquo; prices for penny stocks and the
    significance of the spread between the &ldquo;bid&rdquo; and &ldquo;ask&rdquo; price;

 type
 size and format)
 as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation.

 the broker-dealer also must provide the customer the following:



    
    
the bid and offer
    quotations for the penny stock;

    
    
    

    
    
the compensation
    of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction;

    
    
    

    
    
the number of shares
    to which such bid and ask prices apply

    for such stock; and

    
    
    

    
    
monthly account
    statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer&rsquo;s account.



 the penny stock rules require
that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules
 the broker-dealer must make a special written
determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser&rsquo;s written acknowledgment
of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement
 a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks
 and a signed and dated
copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in
the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. Holders of shares of our common stock may have
difficulty selling those shares because our common stock will probably be subject to the penny stock rules.

AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION

statement involves risks and uncertainties
 and that although we believe the assumptions on which our forward-looking statements
are based are reasonable
 any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate
 and as a result
 the forward-looking statements
based on those assumptions could be incorrect. In light of these and other uncertainties
 you should not conclude that we will
necessarily achieve any plans and objectives or projected financial results referred to in any of the forward-looking statements.
We do not undertake to release the results of any revisions of these forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances.
Some of the factors that may cause actual results
 developments and business decisions to differ materially from those contemplated
by such forward-looking statements include the following:


 marketing and
distribution company relying on our unique products
 positioning
 and team to develop and market nutritional/snack foods that are
appropriate for evening snacking. Our first product was the Nightfood nutrition bar
 manufactured in two flavors (Cookies n&rsquo;
Dreams
 and Midnight Chocolate Crunch). Management may choose to discontinue the nutrition bars in the near future to have additional
resources available for the ice cream rollout
 which we believe offers a much larger market opportunity.


 the Company began
development of Nightfood ice cream. Having seen the success in the marketplace of &ldquo;better-for-you&rdquo; ice cream brands
such as Halo Top
 Enlightened
 and others
 Management believes consumers will be receptive to a line of ice cream that has some
similar benefits to those newly successful brands
 as well as a sleep-friendly nutritional profile.


 and a leading
ice cream research and development team
 eight flavors of Nightfood ice cream were developed and bought to market
 with the initial
production run occurring in January 2019. Nightfood is unique among all other products in the market in that our ice cream was
developed with better sleep in mind. Knowing millions of Americans eat ice cream before bed on any given night
 Management tasked
our team of sleep and nutrition experts with formulating an ice cream that would be more appropriate for nighttime consumption
while delivering better taste and texture than what is currently found in the other &ldquo;better-for-you&rdquo; brands.


 Nightfood
is formulated with less fat
 less sugar
 fewer calories
 plus certain minerals
 digestive enzymes
 and amino acids recommended
by our sleep experts.

 obtaining a commitment before the first production run had commenced.
In early February of 2019
 it was announced that Nightfood had won the 2019 Product of the Year Award in the ice cream category
in a Kantar innovation survey of over 40
000 consumers.


 Nightfood

 and many more media outlets.


a subset of consumers will shift their night snacking behavior towards snacks that are formulated to be more &ldquo;sleep friendly&rdquo;
compared to what is currently being consumed by much of the population. As research continues to explore the links between nutrition
and sleep
 and consumers continue to seek healthier snacks in general
 we expect a category to emerge within the marketplace that
we call &ldquo;nighttime nutrition&rdquo;.


annually on snacks consumed at night
 and this figure continues to grow. A majority of adults are trying to eat foods and snacks
that they understand will prevent or manage health problems and 37% of consumers are willing to pay more for foods with perceived
health benefits. Moreover
 industry data indicates that the most popular nighttime snack choices include products and categories
that are traditionally considered high in calories
 and &ldquo;unhealthy&rdquo; options
 such as cookies
 salty snacks (chips
pretzels
 and popcorn)
 ice cream
 and candy.


Mintel and IRI supporting the idea that night-specific snacks represented an opportunity for growth and innovation within the snack
space
 major consumer goods companies have also recently indicated they believe in the category. Doug Munk
 Director of New Business
Ventures for Nestle USA recently stated publicly that Nestle&rsquo;s research indicates &ldquo;&hellip;people are looking to replace
some of their junk foods before they go to sleep with something that is a little better.&rdquo;


in the space
 including the test launch of a direct-to-consumer snack product on Amazon called &ldquo;GoodNight&rdquo;
 represents
early validation for the category concept. While Management continues to iterate on products
 distribution
 and marketing
 the
team steadfastly believes that nighttime nutrition is a billion dollar category in the making. And
 as early is it in the launch
of Nightfood ice cream
 at this moment
 Nightfood is clearly the undisputed leading brand in the night snacking category.




in four of the top-50 supermarket chains in the United States
 Management is working to simultaneously secure additional distribution
opportunities
 while also nurturing revenue and consumer growth in our existing points of distribution.


 additional distribution
relationships were established with regional ice cream distributors and non-traditional retailers
 with varying degrees of success.
Management will continue to work within the industry to identify opportunities to grow the Nightfood brand. Outlets such as hotels
college campus bookstores
 and other non-traditional outlets could develop into relevant elements of our distribution mix in the
near future as the brand continues to grow awareness and distribution infrastructure.

Fiscal Year ended June 30
 2019 Compared
to Fiscal Year ended June 30
 2018





 2019
we had revenues of $352
172 compared to the twelve months ended June 30
 2018 when we had revenues of $196
742. This increase in
revenue resulted from the introduction of Nightfood ice cream during the second half of fiscal 2019. The introduction of our ice
cream
 which delivers a higher gross margin than our nutrition bars
 also resulted in a gross margin of 52% for the year ending
June 30
 2019 compared to 41% for the year ending June 30
 2018. The company also provided certain sales discounts and allowances
of $11

$190
251 for the year ended June 30
 2019 compared to $116
158 for the year ended June 30
 2018. This is due to higher revenues
generated in Fiscal 2019. Total Advertising &amp; Promotion for the year ended June 30
 2019 was $732
297 compared to $189
352
for the year ended June 30
 2018. This increase was due primarily to certain licensing and marketing fees
 along with marketing
partnerships. Paid advertising spend decreased from $115
133 in the year ended June 30
 2018 to $105
855 for the year ended June
30
 2019. Expenses related to the construction of the website for Nightfood Ice Cream
 and the costs for package design and print
preparation were $78
232 for the year ended June 30
 2019 compared to packaging design and web design costs of $139 for the year
ended June 30
 2018. Product sample expense was $30
206 for the year ended June 30
 2019 compared to $0 for the year ended June
30
 2018. Much of this expense was the cost of shipping ice cream
 in coolers and on dry ice via FedEx
 to media outlets and influencers.
For the year ended June 30
 2019
 professional fees were $781
178 compared to $1
177
318 for the year ended June 30
 2019. This
decrease was largely due to the completion of Company efforts to consolidate all debt with one lender during the course of fiscal
2018. This consolidation was completed On July 2
 2018.

 2018
 we had cash on hand of $48
440
accounts receivable of $0
 and inventory value of $103
209. The increase in accounts receivable is due to an increase in overall
sales activity relating to the launch of Nightfood ice cream
 and a larger percentage of our sales resulting from wholesale orders
compared to the prior year. The increase in inventory is due largely to the build-up of ice cream inventory to meet anticipated
demand. During the twelve month period ended June 30
 2019
 we raised $50

 2019
 we had accounts payable

 slotting fees
and inventory production.

resources and we do not believe our cash on hand will be adequate to satisfy our ongoing working capital needs. The Company is
continuing to raise capital through private placement of our common stock
 debt
 and the use of convertible debt to finance the
Company&rsquo;s operations
 of which it can give no assurance of success. However
 we believe that our current capitalization
structure
 combined with the continued expansion of operations
 will enable us to achieve successful financings to continue our
growth.

 the Company cannot give any assurance that it will
 in the future
 be able to achieve a level of profitability
from the sale of its products to sustain its operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability
to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future
effects on recoverability and reclassification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from
the outcome of this uncertainty.

June 30
 2019
 we have generated an accumulated deficit of approximately $13
219
059. Assuming we raise additional funds and continue
operations
 it is possible we could incur additional operating losses during the course of fiscal 2020 and possibly thereafter.
We plan to continue to pay or satisfy existing obligation and commitments and finance our operations
 as we have in the past
primarily through the sale of our securities and other forms of external financing until such time that we are able to generate
sufficient funds from the sale of our products to finance our operations
 of which we can give no assurance.&nbsp;


our operations and we intend to rely on debt and the sale of stock in private placements to increase liquidity and
 we anticipate
deriving additional revenue from product sales in fiscal 2020
 but we cannot at this time quantify the amount. If we are unable
to raise cash through the sale of our stock
 we may be required to severely restrict our operations.

As
of February 8
 2017
 we entered into two agreements with Black Forest
 an Equity Purchase Agreement (the &ldquo;EPA&rdquo;) and
a Registration Rights Agreement (the &ldquo;RRA&rdquo;). The two agreements were filed as exhibits to the Registrant&rsquo;s Current
Report on Form 8-K dated February 8
 2017
 and this Registration Statement is being filed in order for us to fulfill our obligations
under the RRA. The following summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibits to our Form 8-K. On August 24
2017
 the Company issued its first and
 to date
 only &ldquo;put notice&rdquo; to Black Forest and delivered to Black Forest 264
085
shares of common stock in exchange for $30
000. 


    
    



 the Company
entered into convertible promissory notes with one lender with principal totaling $1
602
005
 of which $102
077 of the funds
received were used to pay off older notes
 as the Company has now successfully consolidated 100% of convertible debt with one
lender. We consider our relationship with this lender to be excellent. They have been providing financing for operations for
over twenty-four months
 and have had conversion rights for over twenty-four months as well through acquisition of older
debt. The lender has an understanding of our capital needs for future operations.


 2015
 the Company entered
into a consulting agreement with Sean Folkson. The agreement was retroactive to January 1st
 2015. In exchange for services provided
to the Company by Folkson
 the Company agreed to pay Folkson $6
000 monthly. This compensation expense started accruing on January
1
 2015
 and accrued on a monthly basis through June of 2018.


 and again in June of
2019
 the Company entered into updated consulting agreements with Folkson
 which included a modified compensation structure. Each
new Consulting Agreement contained the identical cash compensation allowance of $6
000 monthly. In addition
 Folkson would earn
Warrants with a strike price of $.50 or $1 when the Company hit certain revenue milestones. All Warrants earned under Folkson&rsquo;s
current agreement would convert into restricted shares
 shall carry a cashless provision
 and must be exercised within 90 days
of the filing of the 10Q or 10K on which such revenues are reported.


 2017
 Folkson elected to
purchase 80
000 warrants to acquire shares of NGTF stock with a strike price of $.20 and a term of 36 months. To acquire these
warrants Folkson paid $.15 per warrant
 totaling $12
000
 treated as a $12
000 reduction to the amount owed to Folkson. In November
2018
 Folkson exercised an existing warrant option and received 400
000 shares of our common stock in exchange for a $120
000
reduction in the amount of accrued consulting fees he was owed. This activity resulted in a decrease in related party accruals
of $164
000.

 Inc. and Subsidiaries




balance sheets of Nightfood Holdings
 Inc. and Subsidiaries (collectively
 the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of June 30
 2019 and
2018
 and the related consolidated statements of operations
 changes in stockholders&rsquo; deficit and cash flows for each of
the two years in the period ended June 30
 2019
 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;consolidated financial
statements&rdquo;). In our opinion
financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
the financial position of the Company at June 30
 2019 and 2018
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the two years in the period ended June 30
 2019
 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

The Company&rsquo;s Ability to Continue as
a Going Concern


statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial
statements
 the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations
 will require additional capital to fund its current operating
plan
 and has stated that substantial doubt exists about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. Management&rsquo;s
plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 3. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of
liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are
required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion

 we express no such opinion.


to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to error or fraud

that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures

by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 Sean Folkson.&nbsp;&nbsp;All
    of its operations are conducted by its two subsidiaries: Nightfood
 Inc. (&ldquo;Nightfood&rdquo;) and MJ Munchies

    formulated for nighttime snacking to help consumers satisfy nighttime cravings in a better
 healthier
 more sleep friendly
    way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Munchies has acquired a portfolio of intellectual property around the brand name Half-Baked

    Company&rsquo;s fiscal year end is June 30.

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
The Company currently
    maintains its corporate address in Tarrytown
 New York.&nbsp;




    
    
    
    
    
Management
    is responsible for the fair presentation of the Company&rsquo;s financial statements
 prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles (GAAP).




    
    
    
The
    preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used in the determination of beneficial conversion
    features
 derivative liabilities
 depreciation and amortization
 the valuation for non-cash issuances of common stock
 and
    the website
 income taxes and contingencies
 among others.

    
    
    
    

    
Beneficial Conversion
    Feature
    
For conventional convertible debt
        where the rate of conversion is below market value
 the Company records any &ldquo;beneficial conversion feature&rdquo;
        (&ldquo;BCF&rdquo;) intrinsic value as additional paid in capital and related debt discount.
        

        the relative fair value of the BCF is recorded as a debt discount against the face amount of the respective debt instrument.
        The discount is amortized over the life of the debt. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs
 a proportionate share
        of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed.

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
The Company may
    pay debt issue costs in connection with raising funds through the issuance of debt whether convertible or not or with other
    consideration. These costs are recorded as debt discounts and are amortized over the life of the debt to the statement of
    operations as amortization of debt discount.

    
    
    
    

    
Original Issue
    Discount
    
If debt is issued
    with an original issue discount
 the original issue discount is recorded to debt discount
 reducing the face amount of the
    note and is amortized over the life of the debt to the statement of operations as amortization of debt discount. If a conversion
    of the underlying debt occurs
 a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed.

    
    
    
    

    
Valuation of
    Derivative Instruments
    
ASC 815 &ldquo;Derivatives
    and Hedging&rdquo; requires that embedded derivative instruments be bifurcated and assessed
 along with free-standing derivative
    instruments such as warrants
 on their issuance date and measured at their fair value for accounting purposes. In determining
    the appropriate fair value
 the Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing formula. Upon conversion of a note where the
    embedded conversion option has been bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative liability
 the Company records the shares
    at fair value
 relieves all related notes
 derivatives and debt discounts and recognizes a net gain or loss on debt extinguishment.



    
    




    
    

    
The Company may make certain reclassifications
to prior period amounts to conform with the current year&rsquo;s presentation. These reclassifications did not have a material
effect on its consolidated statement of financial position
 results of operations or cash flows.


    
    
    
    

    
Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements
    
The Company reviews all of the
        Financial Accounting Standard Board&rsquo;s updates periodically to ensure the Company&rsquo;s compliance of its accounting
        policies and disclosure requirements to the Codification Topics.
        

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts
with Customers
 to establish ASC Topic 606
 (ASC 606). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic
605
 Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The core principle
of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in
an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The
guidance includes a five-step framework that requires an entity to: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer
 (ii) identify
the performance obligations in the contract
 (iii) determine the transaction price
 (iv) allocate the transaction price to the
performance obligations in the contract
 and (v) recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In addition
the standard requires disclosure of the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts
with customers.
        

 the FASB issued
        ASU No. 2016-01
 Financial Instruments &ndash; Overall: Recognition and Measurements of Financial Assets and Financial
        Liabilities. The standard will be effective for us beginning January 1
 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of
        this standard on our financial statements
 including accounting policies
 processes
 and systems.
        

 the FASB issued
        ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842) and subsequently amended the guidance relating largely to transition considerations
        under the standard in January 2017
 to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition
        of right-of-use (&ldquo;ROU&rdquo;) assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. Most prominent among the changes
        in the standard is the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating
        leases under current U.S. GAAP. Under the standard
 disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of
        financial statements to assess the amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. We will be required
        to recognize and measure leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented
        using a modified retrospective approach
 with certain practical expedients available.
        

July 1
 2019. The standard may have a material impact on our balance sheets in the future if we entered into new leases
 but will
not have a material impact on our statement of operations. The most significant impact will be the recognition of ROU assets and
lease liabilities for operating leases. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our financial statements
 including
accounting policies
 processes
 and systems.


        these emerging issues to assess any potential future impact on its financial statements.



    
    




    
Derivative
    Financial Instruments
    
The Company does not use derivative
        instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow
 market or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial
        instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives.
        For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities
 the derivative instrument is initially recorded
        at its fair value and then is revalued at each reporting date
 with changes in fair value reported in the consolidated
        statement of operations. For stock based derivative financial instruments
 Fair value accounting requires bifurcation
        of embedded derivative instruments such as conversion features in convertible debt or equity instruments
 and measurement
        of their fair value for accounting purposes. In determining the appropriate fair value
 the Company uses the Black-Scholes
        option-pricing model. In assessing the convertible debt instruments
 management determines if the convertible debt host
        instrument is conventional convertible debt and further if there is a beneficial conversion feature requiring measurement.
        If the instrument is not considered conventional convertible debt
 the Company will continue its evaluation process of
        these instruments as derivative financial instruments.
        

 derivative liabilities
        are adjusted to reflect fair value at the end of each reporting period. Any increase or decrease in the fair value from
        inception is made quarterly and appears in results of operations as a change in fair market value of derivative liabilities.

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
The Company classifies
    as cash and cash equivalents amounts on deposit in the banks and cash temporarily in various instruments with original maturities
    of three months or less at the time of purchase.

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
Statement of financial
    accounting standard FASB Topic 820
 Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 requires that the Company disclose
    estimated fair values of financial instruments. The carrying amounts reported in the statements of financial position for
    assets and liabilities qualifying as financial instruments are a reasonable estimate of fair value.

    
    
    
    

    
    
    

realizable value
 including provisions for spoilage commensurate with known or estimated exposures which are recorded as a charge
to cost of sales during the period spoilage is incurred.

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
Advertising costs
    are expensed when incurred and are included in advertising and promotional expense in the accompanying statements of operations.
    &nbsp;Included in this category are expenses related to public relations
 investor relations
 new package design
 website
    design
 design of promotional materials
 cost of trade shows
 cost of products given away as promotional samples
 and paid
    advertising.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company incurred advertising costs of $732
297 and $189
352 for the years ended June 30
 2019
    and 2018
 respectively.




    
    
    
The
    Company has not generated any taxable income
 and
 therefore
 no provision for income taxes has been provided.

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
Deferred income
    taxes are reported for timing differences between items of income or expense reported in the financial statements and those
    reported for income tax purposes in accordance with FASB Topic 740
 &ldquo;Accounting for Income Taxes&rdquo;
 which requires
    the use of the asset/liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes and tax benefits are recognized
    for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
    and liabilities and their respective tax bases
 and for tax loss and credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
    are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company provides for deferred taxes for the estimated future tax effects attributable
    to temporary differences and carry-forwards when realization is more likely than not.





    
    
    
A valuation
    allowance has been recorded to fully offset the deferred tax asset even though the Company believes it is more likely than
    not that the assets will be utilized.

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
The Company&rsquo;s
    effective tax rate differs from the statutory rates associated with taxing jurisdictions because of permanent and temporary
    timing differences as well as a valuation allowance.



    
    




    
    
    
The
    Company generates its revenue from products sold from traditional retail outlets along with items distributed from the Company&rsquo;s
    and other customer websites.




    
    
    
All sources of revenue
    are recorded pursuant to FASB Topic 606 Revenue Recognition
 to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers
    in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
    This includes a five-step framework that requires an entity to: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer
 (ii) identify
    the performance obligations in the contract
 (iii) determine the transaction price
 (iv) allocate the transaction price to
    the performance obligations in the contract
 and (v) recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
    In addition
 this revenue generation requires disclosure of the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash
    flows arising from contracts with customers.

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
The
        Company occasionally offers sales incentives through various programs
 consisting primarily of advertising related credits.
        The Company records advertising related credits with customers as a reduction to revenue as no identifiable benefit is
        received in exchange for credits claimed by the customer.
        
The
        Company revenue from contracts with customers provides that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer
        of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to
        be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
        
The
        Company incurs costs associated with product distribution
 such as freight and handling costs. The Company has elected
        to treat these costs as fulfillment activities and recognizes these costs at the same time that it recognizes the underlying
        product revenue. As this policy election is in line with the Company&rsquo;s previous accounting practices
 the treatment
        of shipping and handling activities under FASB Topic 606 did not have any impact on the Company&rsquo;s results of operations
        financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.
        
The
        adoption of ASC 606 did not result in a change to the accounting for any of the Company&rsquo;s revenue streams that are
        within the scope of the amendments. The Company&rsquo;s services that fall within the scope of ASC 606 are recognized
        as revenue as the Company satisfies its obligation to the customer.
        
In
        May 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 which updates revenue recognition guidance
        relating to contracts with customers. This standard states that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer
        of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to
        be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods
 and interim
        periods therein
 beginning after July 1
 2018. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 and its related amendments (collectively
        known as &ldquo;ASC 606&rdquo;) during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the full retrospective method




    
Concentration of Credit
    Risk
    
Financial
    instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash deposits at
    financial institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;At various times during the year
 the Company may exceed the federally insured limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;To
    mitigate this risk
 the Company places its cash deposits only with high credit quality institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management
    believes the risk of loss is minimal.&nbsp;&nbsp;At June 30
 2019 and 2018 the Company did not have any uninsured cash deposits.

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
For conventional convertible debt
        where the rate of conversion is below market value
 the Company records any &ldquo;beneficial conversion feature&rdquo;
        (&ldquo;BCF&rdquo;) intrinsic value as additional paid in capital and related debt discount.
        

        the relative fair value of the BCF is recorded as a debt discount against the face amount of the respective debt instrument.
        The discount is amortized over the life of the debt. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs
 a proportionate share
        of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed.

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
The Company may
    pay debt issue costs in connection with raising funds through the issuance of debt whether convertible or not or with other
    consideration. These costs are recorded as debt discounts and are amortized over the life of the debt to the statement of
    operations as amortization of debt discount.

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
If debt is issued
    with an original issue discount
 the original issue discount is recorded to debt discount
 reducing the face amount of the
    note and is amortized over the life of the debt to the statement of operations as amortization of debt discount. If a conversion
    of the underlying debt occurs
 a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed.

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
ASC 815 &ldquo;Derivatives
    and Hedging&rdquo; requires that embedded derivative instruments be bifurcated and assessed
 along with free-standing derivative
    instruments such as warrants
 on their issuance date and measured at their fair value for accounting purposes. In determining
    the appropriate fair value
 the Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing formula. Upon conversion of a note where the
    embedded conversion option has been bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative liability
 the Company records the shares
    at fair value
 relieves all related notes
 derivatives and debt discounts and recognizes a net gain or loss on debt extinguishment.&nbsp;



    
    




    
    
    
The Company does not use derivative
        instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow
 market or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial
        instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives.

        are adjusted to reflect fair value at the end of each reporting period. Any increase or decrease in the fair value from
        inception is made quarterly and appears in results of operations as a change in fair market value of derivative liabilities.




    
    
    
The
    Company&rsquo;s financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles
 which contemplate the realization
    of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the business is new and has
    limited operating history and relatively few sales
 no certainty of continuation can be stated.




    
    
    
Management
    is taking steps to raise additional funds to address its operating and financial cash requirements to continue operations
    in the next twelve months. Management has devoted a significant amount of time in the raising of capital from additional debt
    and equity financing. However
 the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon raising additional
    funds through debt and equity financing and generating revenue. There are no assurances the Company will receive the necessary
    funding or generate revenue necessary to fund operations.




    
    
    
The
    Company&rsquo;s accounts receivable arise primarily from the sale of the Company&rsquo;s snack products. On a periodic basis
    the Company evaluates each customer account and based on the days outstanding of the receivable
 history of past write-offs
    collections
 and current credit conditions
 writes off accounts it considers uncollectible. With most of our retail and distribution
    partners
 invoices will typically be due in 30 days. The Company does not accrue interest on past due accounts and the Company
    does not require collateral. Accounts become past due on an account-by-account basis. Determination that an account is uncollectible
    is made after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted. The Company has not provided any sales allowances for
    June 30
 2019 and June 30
 2018
 respectively.

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
During the year
    ended June 30
 2019
 two customers accounted for greater than 10% of revenues




    
    
    

 2019 and 2018.

Inventories are
    stated at the lower of cost (FIFO) or net realizable value. The Company periodically reviews the value of items in inventory
    and provides write-downs or write-offs of inventory based on its assessment of market conditions and the products relative
    shelf life. Write-downs and write-offs are charged to loss on inventory write down.

 the
    Company has determined that the conversion feature is considered a derivative liability for instruments which are convertible

During
    the year ended June 30
 2019
 the Company recorded a loss in fair value of derivative $712
627. The Company will measure the
    fair value of each derivative instrument in future reporting periods and record a gain or loss based on the change in fair
    value.

The Company has never issued

During
    the fiscal year ended June 30
 2019 Mr. Folkson exercised his warrant option and received 400
000 shares of our common stock
    valued at $120
000. 




    
    
    
During
    the third quarter 2015
 Mr. Folkson began accruing a consulting fee of $6
000 per month which the aggregate of $72
000 and
    $72
000 is reflected in professional fees and presented in the accrued expenses &ndash; related party for 2019 and 2018 respectively.



    
    





    
    
    
The
    original consulting agreement for Mr. Folkson had a term of one year
 and then converted into a month to month effective January
    1
 2016. A new twelve month consulting agreement was entered into for Mr. Folkson effective July 1
 2019
 which paid Folkson
    the same $6
000 monthly consulting fee.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition
 the Company made bonuses available to Folkson upon the Company
    hitting certain revenue milestones of$1
000
000 in a quarter and $3
000
000 in a quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achieving those
    milestones would earn Folkson warrants with a $.50 and $1 strike price which would need to be exercised within 90 days of
    the respective quarterly or annual filing

    of the statutory income tax rates and the Company&rsquo;s effective tax rate is as follows:

 2019 the Company had estimated
U.S. federal net operating losses of approximately $ 5
307
000 for income tax purposes. $ 2
614
000 will expire between 2031 and
2037 while the balance of the tax operating loss can be carried forward indefinitely. For financial reporting purposes
 the entire
amount of the net deferred tax assets has been offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertainty regarding the realization of
the assets. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the year ended June 30
 2019 was an increase of $329
033. The Company
follows FASC 740-10-25 P which requires a company to evaluate whether a tax position taken by the company will &ldquo;more likely
than not&rdquo; be sustained upon examination by the appropriate tax authority. The Company has analyzed filing positions in all
of the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns
 as well as all open tax years in these
jurisdictions. The Company believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions would be sustained on audit and does not
anticipate any adjustments that would result in a material change to its financial position. Therefore
 no reserves for uncertain
income tax positions have been recorded.

        

        utilize the net operating loss carryforwards for its US income taxes in future periods should it experience a change in
        ownership as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (&ldquo;IRC&rdquo;). Under section 382
 should the Company
        experience a more than 50% change in its ownership over a 3 year period
 the Company would be limited based on a formula
        as defined in the IRC to the amount per year it could utilize in that year of the net operating loss carryforwards.
        

 2019 the Company
        had not performed an analysis to determine if the Company was subject to the provisions of Section 382. The Company is
        subject to U.S. federal income tax including state and local jurisdictions. Currently
 no federal or state income tax
        returns are under examination by the respective taxing jurisdictions.
        

        policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. The Company has
        not accrued interest for any periods.
        

        tax returns for the fiscal years ended June 30
 2018
 June 30
 2017 and 2016 respectively
 however it believes due to
        the reported losses there is no material liability outstanding.

Fair value is defined
    as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures
 Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) ASC Topic 820-10-35 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
    techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets
    for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).

    
    
    

    
    
&mdash;Valuations
    based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.

    
    
    

    
    
&mdash;Valuations
    based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1
 such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities
    in active markets
 quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active
 or other
    inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

    
    
    

    
    
&mdash;Valuations
    based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions
 consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other
    market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.

    
    
    

    
    
The application
    of the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under Topic 820-10-35 to our assets and liabilities are described below:

Net Loss per Share of
    Common Stock
    
The
    Company has adopted FASB Topic 260
 &ldquo;Earnings per Share
&rdquo; which requires presentation of basic and diluted EPS
    on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the
    numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS computation. In
    the accompanying financial statements
 basic loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted
    average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic net loss per common share is based
    upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury
    stock method. Under this method
 options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the
    time of issuance
 if later)
 and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price
    during the period. However
 shares associated with convertible debt
 stock options&nbsp;and stock warrants are not included
    because the inclusion would be anti-dilutive (i.e. reduce the net loss per common share).&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no anti-dilutive
    instruments.

in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78a
) is recorded

without limitation
 controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer (principal

 to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

assets of the issuer;



Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with

that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud.
A control system
 no matter how well conceived and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Further
 the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements
 and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
 within the registrant have been detected. Also
 projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.



    
    


Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures
reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We carried out an evaluation
under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer
 of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation
 our chief
executive officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at June 30
 2019 due to the lack of
accounting and management personnel
 as well as insufficient funds to fully engage necessary legal and compliance resources. We
will consider hiring additional employees when we obtain sufficient capital.

 Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify&gt;The Company does not use derivative&#13;        instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial&#13;        instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives.&#13;        For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded&#13;        at its fair value and then is revalued at each reporting date, with changes in fair value reported in the consolidated&#13;        statement of operations. For stock based derivative financial instruments, Fair value accounting requires bifurcation&#13;        of embedded derivative instruments such as conversion features in convertible debt or equity instruments, and measurement&#13;        of their fair value for accounting purposes. In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company uses the Black-Scholes&#13;        option-pricing model. In assessing the convertible debt instruments, management determines if the convertible debt host&#13;        instrument is conventional convertible debt and further if there is a beneficial conversion feature requiring measurement.&#13;        If the instrument is not considered conventional convertible debt, the Company will continue its evaluation process of&#13;        these instruments as derivative financial instruments.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;        &lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;Deferred income&#13;    taxes are reported for timing differences between items of income or expense reported in the financial statements and those&#13;    reported for income tax purposes in accordance with FASB Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires&#13;    the use of the asset/liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes and tax benefits are recognized&#13;    for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets&#13;    and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax loss and credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities&#13;    are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences&#13;    are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company provides for deferred taxes for the estimated future tax effects attributable&#13;    to temporary differences and carry-forwards when realization is more likely than not.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#13;&lt;/table&gt;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;The&#13;    Company is authorized to issue One Hundred Million (200,000,000) shares of $0.001 par value per share Common Stock. Holders&#13;    of Common Stock are each entitled to cast one vote for each Share held of record on all matters presented to shareholders.&#13;    Cumulative voting is not allowed; hence, the holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Stock can elect all directors.&#13;    Holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally&#13;    available therefore and, in the event of liquidation, to share pro-rata in any distribution of the Company's assets&#13;    after payment of liabilities. The Board of Directors is not obligated to declare a dividend and it is not anticipated that&#13;    dividends will be paid unless and until the Company is profitable. Holders of Common Stock do not have pre-emptive rights&#13;    to subscribe to additional shares if issued by the Company. There are no conversion, redemption, sinking fund or similar provisions&#13;    regarding the Common Stock. All of the outstanding Shares of Common Stock are fully paid and non-assessable and all of the&#13;    Shares of Common Stock offered thereby will be, upon issuance, fully paid and non-assessable. Holders of Shares of Common&#13;    Stock will have full rights to vote on all matters brought before shareholders for their approval, subject to preferential&#13;    rights of holders of any series of Preferred Stock. Holders of the Common Stock will be entitled to receive dividends, if&#13;    and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available, and share pro-rata in any distributions to holders&#13;    of Common Stock upon liquidation. The holders of Common Stock will have no conversion, pre-emptive or other subscription rights.&#13;    Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, assets, after the payment of debts and liabilities and any&#13;    liquidation preferences of, and unpaid dividends on, any class of preferred stock then outstanding, will be distributed pro-rata&#13;    to the holders of the common stock. The holders of the common stock have no right to require the Company to redeem or purchase&#13;    their shares. Holders of shares of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights, which means that the holders of more&#13;    than 50% of the outstanding shares, voting for the election of directors, can elect all of the directors to be elected, if&#13;    they so choose, and, in that event, the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any of our directors.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font style=font-size: 10pt&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#13;&lt;/table&gt;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;Fair value is defined&#13;    as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market&#13;    participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, Financial Accounting Standards&#13;    Board (FASB) ASC Topic 820-10-35 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation&#13;    techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets&#13;    for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#13;&lt;tr style=vertical-align: top&gt;&#13;    &lt;td&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&#13;    &lt;td&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&#13;    &lt;td style=text-align: justify&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#13;&lt;tr style=vertical-align: top&gt;&#13;    &lt;td&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&#13;    &lt;td&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&#13;    &lt;td style=padding-left: 20pt; text-align: justify&gt;&lt;font style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;ASC 815 Derivatives&#13;    and Hedging requires that embedded derivative instruments be bifurcated and assessed, along with free-standing derivative&#13;    instruments such as warrants, on their issuance date and measured at their fair value for accounting purposes. In determining&#13;    the appropriate fair value, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing formula. Upon conversion of a note where the&#13;    embedded conversion option has been bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative liability, the Company records the shares&#13;    at fair value, relieves all related notes, derivatives and debt discounts and recognizes a net gain or loss on debt extinguishment.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#13;&lt;/table&gt;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify&gt;In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts&#13;with Customers, to establish ASC Topic 606, (ASC 606). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic&#13;605, Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The core principle&#13;of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in&#13;an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The&#13;guidance includes a five-step framework that requires an entity to: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify&#13;the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the&#13;performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In addition,&#13;the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts&#13;with customers.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;        &lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify&gt;In February 2016, the FASB issued&#13;        ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) and subsequently amended the guidance relating largely to transition considerations&#13;        under the standard in January 2017, to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition&#13;        of right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. Most prominent among the changes&#13;        in the standard is the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating&#13;        leases under current U.S. GAAP. Under the standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of&#13;        financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. We will be required&#13;        to recognize and measure leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented&#13;        using a modified retrospective approach, with certain practical expedients available.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;        &lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

For stock based derivative financial instruments, Fair value accounting requires bifurcation&#13;        of embedded derivative instruments such as conversion features in convertible debt or equity instruments, and measurement&#13;        of their fair value for accounting purposes. In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company uses the Black-Scholes&#13;        option-pricing model. In assessing the convertible debt instruments, management determines if the convertible debt host&#13;        instrument is conventional convertible debt and further if there is a beneficial conversion feature requiring measurement.&#13;        If the instrument is not considered conventional convertible debt, the Company will continue its evaluation process of&#13;        these instruments as derivative financial instruments.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;        &lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;ASC 815 Derivatives&#13;    and Hedging requires that embedded derivative instruments be bifurcated and assessed, along with free-standing derivative&#13;    instruments such as warrants, on their issuance date and measured at their fair value for accounting purposes. In determining&#13;    the appropriate fair value, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing formula. Upon conversion of a note where the&#13;    embedded conversion option has been bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative liability, the Company records the shares&#13;    at fair value, relieves all related notes, derivatives and debt discounts and recognizes a net gain or loss on debt extinguishment.&amp;#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#13;&lt;/table&gt;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify&gt;The Company does not use derivative&#13;        instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial&#13;        instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives.&#13;        For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded&#13;        at its fair value and then is revalued at each reporting date, with changes in fair value reported in the consolidated&#13;        statement of operations. For stock based derivative financial instruments, fair value accounting requires bifurcation&#13;        of embedded derivative instruments such as conversion features in convertible debt or equity instruments, and measurement&#13;        of their fair value for accounting purposes. In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company uses the Black-Scholes&#13;        option-pricing model. In assessing the convertible debt instruments, management determines if the convertible debt host&#13;        instrument is conventional convertible debt and further if there is a beneficial conversion feature requiring measurement.&#13;        If the instrument is not considered conventional convertible debt, the Company will continue its evaluation process of&#13;        these instruments as derivative financial instruments.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;        &lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify&gt;In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts&#13;with Customers, to establish ASC Topic 606, (ASC 606). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic&#13;605, Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The core principle&#13;of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in&#13;an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The&#13;guidance includes a five-step framework that requires an entity to: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify&#13;the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the&#13;performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In addition,&#13;the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts&#13;with customers.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;        &lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify&gt;In February 2016, the FASB issued&#13;        ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) and subsequently amended the guidance relating largely to transition considerations&#13;        under the standard in January 2017, to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition&#13;        of right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. Most prominent among the changes&#13;        in the standard is the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating&#13;        leases under current U.S. GAAP. Under the standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of&#13;        financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. We will be required&#13;        to recognize and measure leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented&#13;        using a modified retrospective approach, with certain practical expedients available.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;        &lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif&gt;The&#13;    Company has adopted FASB Topic 260, Earnings per Share
 which requires presentation of basic and diluted EPS&#13;    on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the&#13;    numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS computation. In&#13;    the accompanying financial statements, basic loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted&#13;    average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Basic net loss per common share is based&#13;    upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury&#13;    stock method. Under this method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the&#13;    time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price&#13;    during the period. However, shares associated with convertible debt, stock options&amp;#160;and stock warrants are not included&#13;    because the inclusion would be anti-dilutive (i.e. reduce the net loss per common share).&amp;#160;&amp;#160;There were no anti-dilutive&#13;    instruments.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#13;&lt;/table&gt;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify&gt;At June 30, 2019 the Company had estimated&#13;U.S. federal net operating losses of approximately $ 5,307,000 for income tax purposes. $ 2,614,000 will expire between 2031 and&#13;2037 while the balance of the tax operating loss can be carried forward indefinitely. For financial reporting purposes, the entire&#13;amount of the net deferred tax assets has been offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertainty regarding the realization of&#13;the assets. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the year ended June 30, 2019 was an increase of $329,033. The Company&#13;follows FASC 740-10-25 P which requires a company to evaluate whether a tax position taken by the company will more likely&#13;than not be sustained upon examination by the appropriate tax authority. The Company has analyzed filing positions in all&#13;of the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in these&#13;jurisdictions. The Company believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions would be sustained on audit and does not&#13;anticipate any adjustments that would result in a material change to its financial position. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain&#13;income tax positions have been recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

Under section 382, should the Company&#13;        experience a more than 50% change in its ownership over a 3 year period, the Company would be limited based on a formula&#13;        as defined in the IRC to the amount per year it could utilize in that year of the net operating loss carryforwards.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;        &lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

The
    Company's financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles
 which contemplate the realization
    of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.&#160;&#160;Because the business is new and has
    limited operating history and relatively few sales
 no certainty of continuation can be stated.




    
    
    
Management
    is taking steps to raise additional funds to address its operating and financial cash requirements to continue operations
    in the next twelve months. Management has devoted a significant amount of time in the raising of capital from additional debt
    and equity financing. However
 the Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon raising additional
    funds through debt and equity financing and generating revenue. There are no assurances the Company will receive the necessary
    funding or generate revenue necessary to fund operations.



































Disclosure of accounting policy for reporting when there is a substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time (generally a year from the balance sheet date). Disclose: (a) pertinent conditions and events giving rise to the assessment of substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time
 (b) the possible effects of such conditions and events
 (c) management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions and events and any mitigating factors
 (d) possible discontinuance of operations
 (e) management's plans (including relevant prospective financial information)

The
    preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used in the determination of beneficial conversion
    features
 derivative liabilities
 depreciation and amortization
 the valuation for non-cash issuances of common stock
 and
    the website
 income taxes and contingencies
 among others.




Beneficial Conversion
    Feature
    
For conventional convertible debt
        where the rate of conversion is below market value
 the Company records any beneficial conversion feature
        (BCF) intrinsic value as additional paid in capital and related debt discount.
        

        the relative fair value of the BCF is recorded as a debt discount against the face amount of the respective debt instrument.
        The discount is amortized over the life of the debt. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs
 a proportionate share
        of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed.





    
    
The Company may
    pay debt issue costs in connection with raising funds through the issuance of debt whether convertible or not or with other
    consideration. These costs are recorded as debt discounts and are amortized over the life of the debt to the statement of
    operations as amortization of debt discount.




Original Issue
    Discount
    
If debt is issued
    with an original issue discount
 the original issue discount is recorded to debt discount
 reducing the face amount of the
    note and is amortized over the life of the debt to the statement of operations as amortization of debt discount. If a conversion
    of the underlying debt occurs
 a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed.




Valuation of
    Derivative Instruments
    
ASC 815 Derivatives
    and Hedging requires that embedded derivative instruments be bifurcated and assessed
 along with free-standing derivative
    instruments such as warrants
 on their issuance date and measured at their fair value for accounting purposes. In determining
    the appropriate fair value
 the Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing formula. Upon conversion of a note where the
    embedded conversion option has been bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative liability
 the Company records the shares
    at fair value
 relieves all related notes
 derivatives and debt discounts and recognizes a net gain or loss on debt extinguishment.





    
The
    Company may make certain reclassifications to prior period amounts to conform with the current year&#8217;s presentation.
    These reclassifications did not have a material effect on its consolidated statement of financial position
 results of operations
    or cash flows.




Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements
    
The Company reviews all of the
        Financial Accounting Standard Board's updates periodically to ensure the Company's compliance of its accounting
        policies and disclosure requirements to the Codification Topics.
        

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts
with Customers
 to establish ASC Topic 606
 (ASC 606). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic
605
 Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The core principle
of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in
an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The
guidance includes a five-step framework that requires an entity to: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer
 (ii) identify
the performance obligations in the contract
 (iii) determine the transaction price
 (iv) allocate the transaction price to the
performance obligations in the contract
 and (v) recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In addition
the standard requires disclosure of the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts
with customers.
        

 the FASB issued
        ASU No. 2016-01
 Financial Instruments &#8211; Overall: Recognition and Measurements of Financial Assets and Financial
        Liabilities. The standard will be effective for us beginning January 1
 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of
        this standard on our financial statements
 including accounting policies
 processes
 and systems.
        

 the FASB issued
        ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842) and subsequently amended the guidance relating largely to transition considerations
        under the standard in January 2017
 to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition
        of right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. Most prominent among the changes
        in the standard is the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating
        leases under current U.S. GAAP. Under the standard
 disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of
        financial statements to assess the amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. We will be required
        to recognize and measure leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented
        using a modified retrospective approach
 with certain practical expedients available.
        

July 1
 2019. The standard may have a material impact on our balance sheets in the future if we entered into new leases
 but will
not have a material impact on our statement of operations. The most significant impact will be the recognition of ROU assets and
lease liabilities for operating leases. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our financial statements
 including
accounting policies
 processes
 and systems.


        these emerging issues to assess any potential future impact on its financial statements.





Derivative
    Financial Instruments
    
The Company does not use derivative
        instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow
 market or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial
        instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives.
        For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities
 the derivative instrument is initially recorded
        at its fair value and then is revalued at each reporting date
 with changes in fair value reported in the consolidated
        statement of operations. For stock based derivative financial instruments
 Fair value accounting requires bifurcation
        of embedded derivative instruments such as conversion features in convertible debt or equity instruments
 and measurement
        of their fair value for accounting purposes. In determining the appropriate fair value
 the Company uses the Black-Scholes
        option-pricing model. In assessing the convertible debt instruments
 management determines if the convertible debt host
        instrument is conventional convertible debt and further if there is a beneficial conversion feature requiring measurement.
        If the instrument is not considered conventional convertible debt
 the Company will continue its evaluation process of
        these instruments as derivative financial instruments.
        

 derivative liabilities
        are adjusted to reflect fair value at the end of each reporting period. Any increase or decrease in the fair value from
        inception is made quarterly and appears in results of operations as a change in fair market value of derivative liabilities.





    
The Company classifies
    as cash and cash equivalents amounts on deposit in the banks and cash temporarily in various instruments with original maturities
    of three months or less at the time of purchase.





    
Statement of financial
    accounting standard FASB Topic 820
 Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 requires that the Company disclose
    estimated fair values of financial instruments. The carrying amounts reported in the statements of financial position for
    assets and liabilities qualifying as financial instruments are a reasonable estimate of fair value.





    
    
Inventories consisting
    of packaged food items and supplies are stated at the lower of cost (FIFO) or market
 including provisions for spoilage commensurate
    with known or estimated exposures which are recorded as a charge to cost of sales during the period spoilage is incurred.&#160;&#160;






Advertising
    Costs
    
Advertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in advertising and promotional expense in the accompanying statements of operations. &#160;Included in this category are expenses related to public relations
 investor relations
 new package design
 website design
 design of promotional materials
 cost of trade shows
 cost of products given away as promotional samples
 and paid advertising.&#160;&#160;The Company incurred advertising costs of $732
297 and $189
352 for the years ended June 30
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.






    
    
The
    Company has not generated any taxable income
 and
 therefore
 no provision for income taxes has been provided.

    
    
    

    
    
Deferred income
    taxes are reported for timing differences between items of income or expense reported in the financial statements and those
    reported for income tax purposes in accordance with FASB Topic 740
 Accounting for Income Taxes
 which requires
    the use of the asset/liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes and tax benefits are recognized
    for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
    and liabilities and their respective tax bases
 and for tax loss and credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
    are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company provides for deferred taxes for the estimated future tax effects attributable
    to temporary differences and carry-forwards when realization is more likely than not.





    
    
A valuation
    allowance has been recorded to fully offset the deferred tax asset even though the Company believes it is more likely than
    not that the assets will be utilized.

    
    
    

    
    
The Company's
    effective tax rate differs from the statutory rates associated with taxing jurisdictions because of permanent and temporary
    timing differences as well as a valuation allowance.





    
The
    Company generates its revenue from products sold from traditional retail outlets along with items distributed from the Company's
    and other customer websites.




    
    
    
All sources of revenue
    are recorded pursuant to FASB Topic 606 Revenue Recognition
 to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers
    in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
    This includes a five-step framework that requires an entity to: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer
 (ii) identify
    the performance obligations in the contract
 (iii) determine the transaction price
 (iv) allocate the transaction price to
    the performance obligations in the contract
 and (v) recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
    In addition
 this revenue generation requires disclosure of the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash
    flows arising from contracts with customers.

    
    
    
    

    
    
    
The
        Company occasionally offers sales incentives through various programs
 consisting primarily of advertising related credits.
        The Company records advertising related credits with customers as a reduction to revenue as no identifiable benefit is
        received in exchange for credits claimed by the customer.
        
The
        Company revenue from contracts with customers provides that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer
        of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to
        be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
        
The
        Company incurs costs associated with product distribution
 such as freight and handling costs. The Company has elected
        to treat these costs as fulfillment activities and recognizes these costs at the same time that it recognizes the underlying
        product revenue. As this policy election is in line with the Company's previous accounting practices
 the treatment
        of shipping and handling activities under FASB Topic 606 did not have any impact on the Company's results of operations
        financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.
        
The
        adoption of ASC 606 did not result in a change to the accounting for any of the Company's revenue streams that are
        within the scope of the amendments. The Company's services that fall within the scope of ASC 606 are recognized
        as revenue as the Company satisfies its obligation to the customer.
        
In
        May 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 which updates revenue recognition guidance
        relating to contracts with customers. This standard states that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer
        of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to
        be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods
 and interim
        periods therein
 beginning after July 1
 2018. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 and its related amendments (collectively
        known as ASC 606) during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the full retrospective method





Concentration of Credit
    Risk
    
Financial
    instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash deposits at
    financial institutions.&#160;&#160;At various times during the year
 the Company may exceed the federally insured limits.&#160;&#160;To
    mitigate this risk
 the Company places its cash deposits only with high credit quality institutions.&#160;&#160;Management
    believes the risk of loss is minimal.&#160;&#160;At June 30
 2019 and 2018 the Company did not have any uninsured cash deposits.

 2019 the Company had estimated
U.S. federal net operating losses of approximately $ 5
307
000 for income tax purposes. $ 2
614
000 will expire between 2031 and
2037 while the balance of the tax operating loss can be carried forward indefinitely. For financial reporting purposes
 the entire
amount of the net deferred tax assets has been offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertainty regarding the realization of
the assets. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the year ended June 30
 2019 was an increase of $329
033. The Company
follows FASC 740-10-25 P which requires a company to evaluate whether a tax position taken by the company will more likely
than not be sustained upon examination by the appropriate tax authority. The Company has analyzed filing positions in all
of the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns
 as well as all open tax years in these
jurisdictions. The Company believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions would be sustained on audit and does not
anticipate any adjustments that would result in a material change to its financial position. Therefore
 no reserves for uncertain
income tax positions have been recorded.

        

        utilize the net operating loss carryforwards for its US income taxes in future periods should it experience a change in
        ownership as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). Under section 382
 should the Company
        experience a more than 50% change in its ownership over a 3 year period
 the Company would be limited based on a formula
        as defined in the IRC to the amount per year it could utilize in that year of the net operating loss carryforwards.
        

 2019 the Company
        had not performed an analysis to determine if the Company was subject to the provisions of Section 382. The Company is
        subject to U.S. federal income tax including state and local jurisdictions. Currently
 no federal or state income tax
        returns are under examination by the respective taxing jurisdictions.
        

        policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. The Company has
        not accrued interest for any periods.

Due
    to the variable conversion price associated with some of these convertible promissory notes disclosed in Note 8 above
 the
    Company has determined that the conversion feature is considered a derivative liability for instruments which are convertible
    and have not yet been settled. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record
    the fair value of the derivatives on the date they are deemed to be derivative liabilities.




    
    
    
During
    the year ended June 30
 2019
 the Company recorded a loss in fair value of derivative $712
627. The Company will measure the
    fair value of each derivative instrument in future reporting periods and record a gain or loss based on the change in fair
    value.

Net Loss per Share of
    Common Stock
    
The
    Company has adopted FASB Topic 260
 Earnings per Share, which requires presentation of basic and diluted EPS
    on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the
    numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS computation. In
    the accompanying financial statements
 basic loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted
    average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year.&#160;&#160;Basic net loss per common share is based
    upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury
    stock method. Under this method
 options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the
    time of issuance
 if later)
 and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price
    during the period. However
 shares associated with convertible debt
 stock options&#160;and stock warrants are not included
    because the inclusion would be anti-dilutive (i.e. reduce the net loss per common share).&#160;&#160;There were no anti-dilutive
    instruments.

On October
    16
 2013
 the Nightfood
 Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nightfood Holdings
 Inc. Accordingly
 the stockholders'
    equity has been revised to reflect the share exchange on a retroactive basis.




    
    
    
The
    Company is authorized to issue One Hundred Million (200
000
000) shares of $0.001 par value per share Common Stock. Holders
    of Common Stock are each entitled to cast one vote for each Share held of record on all matters presented to shareholders.
    Cumulative voting is not allowed; hence
 the holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Stock can elect all directors.
    Holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally
    available therefore and
 in the event of liquidation
 to share pro-rata in any distribution of the Company's assets
    after payment of liabilities. The Board of Directors is not obligated to declare a dividend and it is not anticipated that
    dividends will be paid unless and until the Company is profitable. Holders of Common Stock do not have pre-emptive rights
    to subscribe to additional shares if issued by the Company. There are no conversion
 redemption
 sinking fund or similar provisions
    regarding the Common Stock. All of the outstanding Shares of Common Stock are fully paid and non-assessable and all of the
    Shares of Common Stock offered thereby will be
 upon issuance
 fully paid and non-assessable. Holders of Shares of Common
    Stock will have full rights to vote on all matters brought before shareholders for their approval
 subject to preferential

The amount of the economic entity's stockholders' equity attributable to the parent excludes the amount of stockholders' equity which is allocable to that ownership interest in subsidiary equity which is not attributable to the parent (noncontrolling interest
 minority interest). This excludes temporary equity and is sometimes called permanent equity.

Tabular disclosure of warrants or rights issued. Warrants and rights outstanding are derivative securities that give the holder the right to purchase securities (usually equity) from the issuer at a specific price within a certain time frame. Warrants are often included in a new debt issue to entice investors by a higher return potential. The main difference between warrants and call options is that warrants are issued and guaranteed by the company
 whereas options are exchange instruments and are not issued by the company. Also
 the lifetime of a warrant is often measured in years
 while the lifetime of a typical option is measured in months. Disclose the title of issue of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the aggregate amount of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the date from which the warrants or rights are exercisable
 and the price at which the warrant or right is exercisable.

Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments
Cash
    and Equivalents
 Receivables
 Other Current Assets
 Short-Term Debt
 Accounts Payable
 Accrued and Other Current Liabilities.

    
    
    

    
    
The carrying
    amounts of these items approximated fair value.

    
    
    

    
    
Fair value is defined
    as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures
 Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (FASB) ASC Topic 820-10-35 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
    techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets
    for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).

    
    
    

    
    
&#8212;Valuations
    based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.

    
    
    

    
    
&#8212;Valuations
    based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1
 such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities
    in active markets
 quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active
 or other
    inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

    
    
    

    
    
&#8212;Valuations
    based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions
 consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other
    market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.

    
    
    

    
    
The application
    of the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under Topic 820-10-35 to our assets and liabilities are described below:
