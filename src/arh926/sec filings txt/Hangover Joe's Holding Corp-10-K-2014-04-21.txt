 movie series from Warner Brothers. The Company sells its products primarily to convenience stores
 liquor stores
 and grocery stores through distribution agreements
 as well as through online internet sales. The Company began selling an original hangover recovery shot in February 2011 and later
 with the signing of the Hangover movie license
 began selling the licensed 







In January
 2014
 Hangover Joe&#8217;s signed a license deal with Git-R-Done Productions
 Inc &#174; (Larry the Cable Guy)
 launching our new healthy
 all natural energy drink shot. We saw a need in the market for an all-natural
 non-caffeinated health &amp; wellness energy product that provides hours of long lasting energy without&#160;&#160;caffeine and sugar. The energy drink market has come under fire in the last year or so because these energy drinks usually have a high concentration of sugar and/or caffeine.&#160;&#160;This product has over 20 key ingredients that provide the body long lasting energy and helps to fight against fatigue as well as aids the body cell building abilities; it also helps to fight against disease and oxidation stress. Git-R-Done Energy is the first energy drink of its type on the market to be powered with Astaxanthin in combination with D-Ribose
 which acts in the body like a natural sugar.



















Hangover Joe&#8217;s Holding Corporation (&#8220;HJHC&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was originally incorporated in the State of Colorado in December 2005 as Across American Real Estate Exchange
 Inc. (&#8220;AAEX&#8221;) to facilitate the exchange of real estate properties between individuals under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code.&#160;&#160;In February 2010
 Accredited Members
 Inc. (&#8220;AMI&#8221;)
 a provider of investor research and management services
 was merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAEX
 and AMI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.&#160;&#160;In May 2010
 AAEX changed its name to Accredited Members Holding Corporation (&#8220;AMHC&#8221;).


On July 25
 2012
 the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) with Hangover Joe&#8217;s
 Inc.
 a privately-held Colorado corporation (&#8220;HOJ&#8221;)
 whereby on July 25
 2012
 AMHC acquired HOJ in a reverse triangular merger (the &#8220;Acquisition&#8221;).&#160;&#160;Upon closing the Acquisition the AMHC issued 83
514
827 common shares to the HOJ shareholders in exchange for all of their ownership interests in HOJ such that the former owners of HOJ owned approximately 69% of the Company post Acquisition.&#160;&#160;The shareholders of the AMHC prior to the Acquisition owned approximately 31% of the Company post Acquisition.&#160;&#160;In connection with the Acquisition on July 25
 2012
 AMHC changed its name to Hangover Joe&#8217;s Holding Corporation.


The Merger Agreement further provided that within five business days after the closing of the Acquisition
 the Company would sell to Accredited Members Acquisition Corporation (&#8220;Buyer&#8221;) all of the equity interests in three of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries (the &#8220;Sale&#8221;)
 being AMI
 AMHC Managed Services
 Inc. and World Wide Premium Packers
 Inc. (collectively
 the &#8220;Subsidiaries&#8221;).&#160;&#160;Buyer is a privately-held Colorado corporation owned by two former directors of the Company
 JW Roth and David Lavigne.&#160;&#160;The parties closed the Sale on July 27
 2012.&#160;&#160;The Buyer paid $10
044 and assumed all liabilities related to the business of the Subsidiaries in exchange for all of the shares in the Subsidiaries owned by the Company.


HOJ is a Colorado corporation formed on March 5
 2012.&#160;&#160;HOJ was formed for the purpose of acquiring all of the assets of both Hangover Joe&#8217;s Products LLC (&#8220;HOJ LLC&#8221;) and Hangover Joe&#8217;s Joint Venture (&#8220;HOJ JV&#8221;).&#160;&#160;HOJ LLC had conducted operations through HOJ JV
 with the owner of HOJ LLC being one of the same owners and control persons of HOJ JV. Effective March 30
 2012
 HOJ acquired the net assets of HOJ LLC and HOJ JV through the issuance of common stock of HOJ.&#160;&#160;Because HOJ had no significant assets or business operations prior to the merger and each of these entities were owned by the same control group
 this transaction was accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 the historical results of operations of HOJ LLC and HOJ JV prior to March 30
 2012 are included in the results of operations of the Company.


Because all of the operating businesses of AMHC were sold within five business days after the Acquisition
 the transaction has been accounted for as a recapitalization of HOJ.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial position
 results of operations and cash flows of HOJ and its predecessor entities
 HOJ LLC and HOJ JV
 prior to the date of the Acquisition. The historical results of operations and cash flows of AMHC and the Subsidiaries prior to the date of the Acquisition have been excluded from the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The historical stockholders&#8217; equity of HOJ prior to the Acquisition has been retroactively restated for the equivalent number of shares received in the exchange after giving effect to any differences in the par value of the AMHC and HOJ common stock
 with an offset to additional paid-in capital.&#160;&#160;The restated consolidated accumulated deficit of the accounting acquirer (HOJ) has been carried forward after the exchange.

On July 25th 2012
 Hangover Joe's became a publicly traded company and is trading on the OTCBB as HJOE. For more information

The energy drink and shot market is a larger more established market segment and is currently dominated by well-known companies such as
 Red Bull
 Monster Energy
 and Rockstar Energy Drinks.&#160;&#160;According to Mintel International
 sales of energy drinks and shots in 2011 totaled about $7 billion.&#160;&#160;Sales of energy shots are expected to grow 98% between 2011 ($1.3 billion) and 2016 ($2.5 billion)
 representing a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 15 percent.


The energy shot market is primarily dominated by 5-Hour Energy with Stacker 2 6-Hour Power
 and Red Bull Energy Shots all competing for a smaller stake in this market.&#160;&#160;Beverage Digest reported that 5-hour Energy
 which overwhelmingly dominates the energy shots category
 grew about 23% in 2011 across all four channels: convenience stores
 drug stores
 mass merchandisers and supermarkets.


The Company&#8217;s plan is to try to ride this significant growth trend in the energy shot market and to lead a new $200+ million recovery drink category
 separate and distinct from energy shots.&#160;&#160;The Company believes our license with the Hangover movie series provides us with a significant branding advantage.&#160;&#160;Further
 we believe our taste profile is superior to the taste profile of other energy shots and hangover recovery products.

Significant estimates are used in accounting for certain items such as the allowance for doubtful accounts
 revenue recognition
 and stock-based compensation. Estimates are based on historical experience
 where applicable
 and assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates
 actual results may differ.





The Company is subject to credit risk through trade receivables. This credit risk has been mitigated by the diversification of the Company&#8217;s operations
 as well as its customer base. The Company grants varying payment terms to its customers. Payment terms for customers can vary from due upon receipt up to net 45 days.



Two customers comprised approximately 78% of the trade accounts receivable at December 31
 2012; these individual customer balances represent approximately 65%
 and 13% of the total trade accounts receivable. Two customers accounted for approximately 20% of net sales for the year ended December 31
 sales represent approximately 10%&#160;of annual net sales. Four customers accounted for 54% of net sales for the year ended December 31
 sales represent approximately 19%
 16%
 10% and 10% of annual net sales.


Ongoing credit evaluations of customers&#8217; financial condition are performed. Collateral is not required. The Company maintains an allowance when necessary for doubtful accounts that is the Company&#8217;s best estimate of potentially uncollectible trade receivables. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices that are considered potentially uncollectible in whole or in part. For those invoices not specifically reviewed or considered uncollectible
 general provisions are provided at different rates
 based upon the age of the receivable
 historical experience
 and other currently available evidence. The allowance estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or as payments are made. As of December 31
 2013
 the allowance for doubtful accounts was $146
604
 and at December 31
 2012
 the allowance for doubtful accounts was $21
624.






Inventory is valued at the lower of cost (first-in
 first-out) or market value. The inventory at December 31
 2012 primarily consisted of packing supplies. The Company has no inventory on hand at December 31
 2013.







The Company has a license with Warner Bros. Consumer Products
 Inc. (&#8220;WBCP&#8221;) that allows the Company the use of the costumes
 artwork
 logos and other elements depicted in the 2009 movie
and the 2012 movie
.&#160;&#160;This license
 as amended
 expires January 31
 2016.&#160;&#160;The terms of the WBCP license provide for royalties based on a percentage of products sold
 as defined
 as well as agreed-upon guaranteed minimum royalties. Guaranteed minimum royalty payments are made periodically over the term of the license and are recorded when paid as an asset&#160;&#160;in the balance sheet.&#160;&#160;The asset&#160;&#160;is amortized to expense as revenue from the related products is recognized.&#160;&#160;If management determines that all or a portion of the minimum guaranteed amounts appear not to be recoverable through future product sales
 the non recoverable portion is charged to expense at that time&#160;&#160;The WBCP license agreement contains various convenants
 terms and conditions
 the violation of which could result in the termination of the WBCP License.






























The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following have occurred: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery to third party distributors and consumers via the Company&#8217;s website has occurred; (3) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Delivery is not considered to have occurred until the title and the risk of loss passes to the customer according to the terms of the contract between the Company and the customer. For sales to distributors
 revenue is usually recognized at the time of delivery. The Company defers revenues on products sold to distributors for which there is a lack of credit history or if the distribution may be in a new market in which the Company has no prior experience. The Company defers revenue in these situations until cash is received. For sales through the Company&#8217;s website
 revenue is recognized at time of shipment.


 with regards to its determination of gross versus net reporting of revenue for transactions with customers. The Company sells
 through its website
 Hangover Joe&#8217;s Recovery Shots. In these transactions
 management has determined that the Company (i) acts as principal; (ii) has the risks and rewards of ownership
 including the risk of loss for collection
 delivery or returns; and (iii) has latitude in establishing price with the customer. For these transactions
 the Company recognizes revenue on a gross basis.


The Company offers a variety of incentives and discounts to distributors

 price allowances
 volume based rebates and product placement fees. These incentives and discounts are reflected as a reduction of gross sales to arrive at net sales. The aggregate deductions from gross sales recorded in relation to these programs were approximately $1
800 and $43
100 for the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012
 respectively.







Cost of goods sold consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the production of its product
 co-packing fees
 and in-bound freight charges. Raw material costs generally account for the largest portion of the cost of goods sold. Raw materials include bottles
 ingredients and packaging materials. The manufacturer is responsible for the ingredients. Costs of goods sold also include obsolescence charges and license and royalty expenses.





The Company relies on its third-party suppliers for raw materials necessary for its products
 and it relies on third-party manufacturers for the production of its product. Although the Company believes that it could utilize alternative suppliers and manufacturers
 any delay in locating and establishing relationships with other suppliers/manufacturers could result in product shortages and back orders for the products
 with a resulting loss of net sales and profitability. The Company&#8217;s third-party manufacturer acquires some ingredients from suppliers outside of the United States. Purchasing these ingredients is subject to the risks generally associated with importing raw materials from other countries
 including
 among other factors
 delays in shipments
 changes in economic and political conditions
 quality assurance
 tariffs
 trade disputes and foreign currency fluctuations. These factors could result in a delay in or disruption of the supply of certain raw materials. Any significant delay in or disruption of the supply of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business.























Sales and marketing costs include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture
 as well as expenses for advertising
 sampling and in-store demonstration costs
 costs for merchandise displays
 point-of-sale materials
 trade shows
 other marketing expenses and product design expenses.






Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Total advertising expenses were approximately $102
000 and $122
000 for the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012
 respectively.





Prior to March 2012
 no provision for income taxes was provided in the accompanying financial statements because HOJ LLC (as a limited liability company)
 and HOJ JV (as a partnership)
 elected to file as partnerships
 and therefore management believes that prior to December 31
 2012 the Company was not subject to income taxes
 and
 that such taxes were the responsibility of the individual member/partners.



Beginning in March 2012
 as a corporation
 the Company now records a provision for deferred income tax assets and liabilities in order to reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between (i) the tax basis of assets and liabilities and (ii) their reported amounts in the financial statements. The provision is based upon enacted tax laws and rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. Although the Company is to file income tax returns in the US Federal jurisdiction and various State jurisdictions
 the Company has not filed income tax returns for the year ended December 31
 2012; however
 as no taxes are estimated to be due
 management does not believe these non-filings will have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.


The Company assesses the likelihood of the financial statement effect of a tax position that should be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority based on the technical merits of the tax position
 circumstances
 and information available as of the reporting date. All tax years remain open and subject to U.S. Federal tax examination. Management does not believe that there are any current tax positions that would result in an asset or liability for taxes being recognized in the accompanying financial statements.








Stock-Based Compensation is recognized for an award of equity instruments in the financial statements and is measured based on the grant date fair value of the award. Stock-Based Compensation expense is recognized over the period of service in exchange for the award (generally the vesting period). The Company estimates the fair value of each stock option at the grant date by using an option pricing model
 typically the Black-Scholes model.






Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Historical loss per share of the accounting acquirer (HOJ) has been adjusted retroactively to reflect the new capital structure of the Company as a result of the Merger Agreement. Diluted net loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company
 unless the effect of such inclusion would reduce a loss or increase earnings per share. For each of the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
 the effect of the inclusion of dilutive shares would have resulted in a decrease in loss per share. Stock options
 warrants
 common shares underlying convertible preferred stock and convertible notes payable in the aggregate of 16
034
287 and 10
355
726 shares as of and for the year ended December 31
 2013 and 2012
 respectively
 were not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per common share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.























Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Accounting standards establish a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
 where available.











































Under fair value accounting
 assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. As of December 31
 2013 and December 31
 2012
 the Company had no financial assets or liabilities required to be reported for fair value purposes.

The carrying value of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments
 including cash
 accounts receivable
 notes and accounts payable
 the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock
 and the inventory financing payable approximate fair value at December 31
 2013 and December 31
 2012
 due to the relatively short maturity of the respective instruments. The fair value of related party payables is not practicable to estimate due to the related party nature of the underlying transactions.













In September 2012
 the Company entered into a factoring agreement with a finance company which provided financing up to $250
000
 secured by the accounts receivable and inventory of the Company. The finance company advanced to the Company up to 80% of eligible accounts receivable and was entitled to collect receivables directly from the Company&#8217;s customers. The Company paid a financing fee equal to 2.5% for receivable amounts outstanding up to 30 days and an additional rate of 0.084% per day (30.7% annualized) after the initial 30 days with a maximum exposure of 60 days.

In October 2012
 the Company entered into a purchase order financing arrangement with this same finance company which supplemented the factoring agreement above. The finance company advanced up to 100% of the manufacturing and shipping costs at the time a Company purchase order was submitted to the manufacturer. The Company paid a financing fee equal to 3.85% of the purchase order amount for each transaction and an additional rate of 0.13% per day (47.4% annualized) after the initial 30 days. As of December 31
 2012
 the inventory financing payable under the purchase order financing and factoring arrangement was $97
611. Amounts outstanding under this agreement were paid in full in January 2013 when the Company entered into the revolving credit facility.


























On January 10
 2013
 the Company entered into a senior secured lending arrangement with TCA Global Credit Master Fund
 LP (&#8220;TCA&#8221;) for up to a maximum borrowing of $6
000
000. The credit facility provided for an initial line of credit of $425
000 based upon accounts receivable and projected sales and is to be used only as permitted under the specified use of proceeds for working capital purposes. The initial line of credit had a six month term from the date of closing with a six month renewal option. The lending arrangement is secured by all of the assets of the Company and restricts the Company from paying dividends. As a partial guaranty under the TCA lending arrangement
 the Company&#8217;s CEO personally guaranteed certain representations made by the Company to TCA. At closing
 the Company was advanced $425
000 less fees and closing costs.


In connection with the agreement above
 TCA charged an investment banking fee consisting of 125
000 shares of newly authorized Series B Preferred Shares of the Company equating to an aggregate of $125
000 in the Company&#8217;s capital stock. The shares are mandatorily redeemable and were scheduled to be repaid in 2013. Also in connection with the TCA agreement
 the Company issued 194
954 shares of common stock to a consulting firm as consideration for a finder&#8217;s fee for this transaction.








On January 10
 2013
 the Board of Directors approved the authorization of 125
000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Series B Preferred Stock&#8221;). In connection with the TCA transaction
 the Company issued 125
000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to TCA. The Series B Preferred Stock ranks pari passu to the Company&#8217;s common stock. The Holder of outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to notice of any shareholders&#8217; meeting and to vote as a single class with the Common Stock upon any matter submitted for approval by the holders of common stock. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall have one vote per share. All outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to be paid the &#8220;Liquidation Preference
&#8221; which is defined and calculated as follows: $125
000 in the aggregate (not on a per share basis)
 payable monthly at various amounts.&#160; In 2013
 $57
000 was paid
 and the remaining balance of $67
500 is due in full by virtue of the TCA default discussed above. The mandatorily redeemable preferred stock is presented as a current liability in the accompanying December 31
 2013 balance sheet.







In June 2013
 the Company closed on a 12%
 12-month convertible promissory note with JMJ Financial (&#8220;JMJ&#8221;) (the &#8220;JMJ Note&#8221;). The face amount of the JMJ Note reflects a principal sum of $500
000
 with total borrowings that may be available of $450
000 (which is net of a 10% original issue discount). Upon closing of the JMJ Note
 the Company received $100
000 from JMJ. In September 2013
 the Company received an additional $25
000 from JMJ.


JMJ has the right
 at its election
 to convert all or part of the outstanding and unpaid principal sum and accrued interest (and any other fees) into shares of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of the Company. The conversion price is the lesser of $0.05 or 70% of the average of the three lowest closing prices in the 25 trading days previous to the conversion.&#160; Subsequent to December 31
 2013
 a portion of the JMJ Note was converted into 6
000
000 common shares.


The Note is subject to various default provisions
 and the occurrence of such an event of default will cause the outstanding principal amount under the JMJ Note
 together with accrued and unpaid interest
 and all other amounts payable under the JMJ Note
 to become
 at JMJ&#8217;s election
 immediately due and payable to JMJ.


The Company determined a beneficial conversion feature existed at the commitment date. A beneficial conversion feature of approximately $32
000 was recorded as a discount to the note and has been amortized over the term of the loan. The debt discount recorded at December 31
 2013 was $14
800.&#160; The JMJ Note has an effective interest rate of approximately 34%.





In December 2013

000 from JSJ Investments Inc. (&#8220;JSJ&#8221;) in exchange for a $25
000 convertible note (the &#8220;JSJ Note&#8221;). This note bears interest at 12% per annum and matures in May 2014. On or after the maturity date
 any unpaid amounts and accrued interest are convertible by the holder
 at the holder&#8217;s discretion
 into shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. The conversion price is at 50% discount of the average of the three lowest closing prices on the previous ten days
 with a maximum conversion price equal to the price if determined on the note execution date.



The JSJ note is subject to various default provisions
 and the occurrence of such an event of default will cause the outstanding principal and interest to become immediately due and payable to JSJ.



In March 2014
 the Company entered into second convertible note with JSJ in exchange for $50
000. This note also bears interest at 12% per annum and matures in September 2014
 with conversion terms similar to the December 2013 note.


The Company determined a beneficial conversion feature existed at the commitment date. A beneficial conversion feature of approximately $12
500 was recorded as a discount to the note and is being&#160;amortized over the term of the loan. The debt discount recorded at December 31
 2013 was $12
500.&#160;The 2013 JSJ Note has an effective interest rate of approximately 62%.

Strategic Consulting Agreement
 related party



In November 2012
 the Company entered into a consulting agreement with The Bricktown Group (&#8220;Bricktown&#8221;) to provide beverage management and strategic advisory consulting services to the Company. The managing partner of Bricktown was appointed as the Company&#8217;s Chief Operating Officer (COO) in March 2013
 and served as the Company&#8217;s COO until August 6
 2013. This consulting agreement had an initial term of six months and was automatically extented through November 2013. The agreement required the Company to pay an upfront retainer of $10
000 and monthly consulting fees of $10
000 per month
 which was to be deferred until the Company raised at least $300
000 in debt or equity. The Company was to issue 3
000
000 shares of the Company's common stock in two tranches
 of which 1
500
000 shares were issuable upon request after January 4
 2013 and 1
500
000 shares were issuable on March l
 2013. The first 1
500
000 shares are non-forfeitable and fully vested on the date of the agreement.


Based upon the terms of the agreement
 the Company determined that the measurement date for the initial 1
500
000 shares to be issued under the agreement is the contract date and calculated a fair value of $225
000 based upon the closing market price on this date. Accordingly
 the Company recorded an accrued consulting cost liability of $225
000 on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31
 2012 until such shares are issued. The stock-based compensation associated with the initial shares of $225
000 was recorded as prepaid consulting costs and was amortized over the initial three months of this agreement. For the year ended December 31
 2013
 the Company recognized consulting expense of $278
616 related to this agreement. The measurement date for the second tranche of 1
500
000 shares was March 1
 2013. The fair value of these shares of $135
000 was determined based upon the closing market price of the Company&#8217;s common stock on this date and was amortized over the remaining term of the contract. On January 10
 2013
 the Company issued the initial 1
500
000 shares of its common stock to Bricktown. The second tranche of shares have not been issued as of December 31
 2013
 and therefore a liability of $135
000 has been included within accrued expenses.


As of December 31
 2013
 the Company has additional accounts payable of approximately $55
100 owed to Bricktown.





During the years ended December 31

 the Company granted&#160;a warrant to a former member of the Company's board of directors for services.&#160; The warrant&#160;provides for the purchase of up to 5
000
000 shares of the Company's common stock at $0.02 per share








Prior to March 31
 2012
 the Company&#8217;s owners/officers contributed management and administrative services to the Company. The fair value of those services has been recorded as an expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements based on the estimated fair value for such services
 with a corresponding credit to contributed capital. The fair value of the historical services was estimated based on the compensation per employment terms that were entered into in March 2012. Contributed services were $50
000 for the year ended 2012.




As discussed in Note 1
 the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with HOJ
 whereby on July 25
 2012
 the Company acquired HOJ in a reverse triangular merger (the &#8220;Acquisition&#8221;). Because all of the operating businesses of AMHC were contemporaneously sold within five business days after the Acquisition
 the transaction has been accounted for as a recapitalization of HOJ. Accordingly
 the consolidated statement of operations includes the historical results of HOJ (a Colorado Corporation) and its predecessor entities
 HOJ LLC (a limited liability company) and HOJ JV (a partnership).


Through March 5
 2012 (the date of incorporation of HOJ)
 no provision for income taxes has been provided in the accompanying combined financial statements because HOJ LLC and HOJ JV elected to file as partnerships
 and therefore HOJ was not subject to income taxes
 and
 that such taxes are the responsibility of the individual member/partners.

Beginning March 5
 2012
 HOJ began recording a provision for deferred income tax assets and liabilities in order to reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between (i) the tax basis of assets and liabilities and (ii) their reported amounts in the financial statements. The provision is based upon enacted tax laws and rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.

On July 25
 2012
December 31
 2012
 the Company&#8217;s net deferred tax assets have been fully reserved
 effectively by a valuation allowance
 because management does not believe realization of the deferred tax assets is sufficiently assured at the balance sheet date.


No income tax benefit was recognized for the years ended December 31
 2013 or 2012 as indicated below:

 2013 the Company has U.S. net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $3.3 million which expire in the years 2029 through 2033.

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at December 31
 2013 and 2012 relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets
 primarily net operating loss carry forwards in various tax jurisdictions. The Company continually assesses both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets can be realized prior to their expiration. Based on the Company&#8217;s assessment
 it has determined the deferred tax assets are not currently realizable.






The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains provisions that limit the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards if there has been a change in ownership as described in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result of the Acquisition in July 2012
 substantial changes in the Company&#8217;s ownership have occurred that may limit or reduce the amount of net operating loss carry- forward that the Company could utilize in the future to offset taxable income. The Company has not completed a detailed Section 382 study to determine what impact
 if any
 that ownership changes may have had on the Company&#8217;s net operating loss carry-forwards.



During the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012
 the Company has not identified any unrecognized tax benefits or had any additions or reductions in tax positions and therefore a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is not presented. The Company does not have any unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31
 2013 and accordingly the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate will not be materially affected by unrecognized tax benefits.





On January 14
 2014
 the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Asher Enterprises
 Inc. (Asher)
 for the sale of an 8% convertible note in the principal amount of $58
000 (the Asher Note). The financing closed on January 14
 2014. The Note bears interest at the rate of 8% per annum. All interest and principal must be repaid on October 9
 2014. The Note is convertible into common stock
 at Asher&#8217;s option
 at a 45% discount to the average of the three lowest closing bid prices of the Company&#8217;s common stock during the 10 trading day period prior to conversion.


The Asher Note is subject to prepayment penalties up to a 140% multiple of the principal
 interest and other amounts owing
 as defined. Asher has agreed to restrict its ability to convert the Note and receive shares of common stock such that the number of shares of common stock held by them in the aggregate and their affiliates after such conversion or exercise does not exceed 9.99% of the then issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The total net proceeds the Company received from this Offering was $58
000
 less financing costs of $3
000. On April 15
 2014
 the Company received a notice of default demanding immediate payment of a sum representing 150% of the outstanding principal plus default interest.




On March 19
 2014

 LLC (LG)

 2015.&#160;&#160;The LG Note is convertible into common stock
 at LG&#8217;s option
 at a 45%&#160;discount&#160;to the&#160;average of the three lowest closing prices of the common stock during the 20 trading day period prior to&#160;conversion.&#160;&#160;The LG Note is subject to prepayment penalties up to a 150% multiple of the principal
 interest and other amounts owing
 as defined.&#160;&#160;After the expiration of 180 days following the date of the LG Note
 the Company has no right of prepayment.&#160;&#160;&#160;


On March 24
 2014
 the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Adar Bays LLC (&#8220;Adar Bays&#8221;)

000). The Company received proceeds of $25
000 (net of financing costs) in exchange for an 8% convertible promissory note due on March 24
 2015.&#160;&#160;This note is convertible into common stock
 at the holder&#8217;s option
 at any time after 180 days at ta 55% discount to the lowest closing bid price of the Company&#8217;s common stock during the 20 day trading period prior to conversion
 as defined.

 whether at maturity or upon acceleration or by prepayment or otherwise. This Note may not be prepaid in whole or in part except as otherwise explicitly set forth herein. Any amount of principal or interest on this Note which is not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of twenty two percent (22%) per annum from the due date thereof until the same is paid (&#8220;Default Interest&#8221;). Interest shall commence accruing on the date that the Note is fully paid and shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. All payments due hereunder (to the extent not converted into common stock
 $0.001 par value per share (the &#8220;Common Stock&#8221;) in accordance with the terms hereof) shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America. All payments shall be made at such address as the Holder shall hereafter give to the Borrower by written notice made in accordance with the provisions of this Note. Whenever any amount expressed to be due by the terms of this Note is due on any day which is not a business day
 the same shall instead be due on the next succeeding day which is a business day and
 in the case of any interest payment date which is not the date on which this Note is paid in full
 the extension of the due date thereof shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining the amount of interest due on such date. As used in this Note
 the term &#8220;business day&#8221; shall mean any day other than a Saturday
 Sunday or a day on which commercial banks in the city of New York
 New York are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed.&#160;&#160;&#160;Each capitalized term used herein
defined
 shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in that certain Securities Purchase Agreement dated the date hereof
 pursuant to which this Note was originally issued (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;).



















This Note is free from all taxes
 liens
 claims and encumbrances with respect to the issue thereof and shall not be subject to preemptive rights or other similar rights of shareholders of the Borrower and will not impose personal liability upon the holder thereof.








. The Holder shall have the right from time to time
 and at any time during the period beginning on the date which is one hundred eighty (180) days following the date of this Note and ending on the later of: (i) the Maturity Date and (ii) the date of payment of the Default Amount (as defined in Article III) pursuant to Section 1.6(a) or Article III
 each in respect of the remaining outstanding principal amount of this Note to convert all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid principal amount of this Note into fully paid and non- assessable shares of Common Stock
 as such Common Stock exists on the Issue Date
 or any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Borrower into which such Common Stock shall hereafter be changed or reclassified at the conversion price (the &#8220;Conversion Price&#8221;) determined as provided herein (a &#8220;Conversion&#8221;); 
 
 that in no event shall the Holder be entitled to convert any portion of this Note in excess of that portion of this Note upon conversion of which the sum of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates (other than shares of Common Stock which may be deemed beneficially owned through the ownership of the unconverted portion of the Notes or the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other security of the Borrower subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitations contained herein) and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the portion of this Note with respect to which the determination of this proviso is being made
 would result in beneficial ownership by the Holder and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. For purposes of the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence
 beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;)
 and Regulations 13D-G thereunder
 except as otherwise provided in clause (1) of such proviso
 
 
 
 that the limitations on conversion may be waived by the Holder upon
 at the election of the Holder
 not less than 61 days&#8217; prior notice to the Borrower
 and the provisions of the conversion limitation shall continue to apply until such 61st day (or such later date
 as determined by the Holder
 as may be specified in such notice of waiver). The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion of this Note shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount (as defined below) by the applicable Conversion Price then in effect on the date specified in the notice of conversion
 in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the &#8220;Notice of Conversion&#8221;)
 delivered to the Borrower by the Holder in accordance with Section 1.4 below; provided that the Notice of Conversion is submitted by facsimile or e-mail (or by other means resulting in
 or reasonably expected to result in
 notice) to the Borrower before 6:00 p.m.
 New York
 New York time on such conversion date (the &#8220;Conversion Date&#8221;). The term &#8220;Conversion Amount&#8221; means
 with respect to any conversion of this Note
 the sum of (1) the principal amount of this Note to be



















(2) at the Holder&#8217;s option
 accrued and unpaid interest
 if any
 on such principal amount at the interest rates provided in this Note to the Conversion Date
(3) at the Holder&#8217;s option
 Default Interest
 if any
(4) at the Holder&#8217;s option
 any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to Sections 1.3 and 1.4(g) hereof.















.&#160;&#160;&#160;The&#160;&#160;&#160;conversion&#160;&#160;&#160;price&#160;&#160;(the &#8220;Conversion Price&#8221;) shall equal the Variable Conversion Price (as defined herein) (subject to equitable adjustments for stock splits
 stock dividends or rights offerings by the&#160;&#160;Borrower relating to the Borrower&#8217;s securities or the securities of any subsidiary of the Borrower
 combinations
 recapitalization
 reclassifications
 extraordinary distributions and similar events). The Variable Conversion Price shall mean 55% multiplied by the Market Price (as defined herein) (representing a discount rate of 45%). &#8220;Market Price&#8221; means the average of the lowest three (3) Trading Prices (as defined below) for the Common Stock during the ten (10) Trading Day period ending on the latest complete Trading Day prior to the Conversion Date. &#8220;Trading Price&#8221; means
 for any security as of any date
 the closing bid price on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board
 or applicable trading market (the &#8220;OTCBB&#8221;) as reported by a reliable reporting service (&#8220;Reporting Service&#8221;) designated by the Holder (i.e. Bloomberg) or
 if the OTCBB is not the principal trading market for such security
 the closing bid price of such security on the principal securities exchange or trading market where such security is listed or traded or
 if no closing bid price of such security is available in any of the foregoing manners
 the average of the closing bid prices of any market makers for such security that are listed in the &#8220;pink sheets&#8221; by the National Quotation Bureau
 Inc. If the Trading Price cannot be calculated for such security on such date in the manner provided above
 the Trading Price shall be the fair market value as mutually determined by the Borrower and the holders of a majority in interest of the Notes being converted for which the calculation of the Trading Price is required in order to determine the Conversion Price of such Notes. &#8220;Trading Day&#8221; shall mean any day on which the Common Stock is tradable for any period on the OTCBB
 or on the principal securities exchange or other securities market on which the Common Stock is then being traded.


.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 1.2(a) to the contrary
 in the event the Borrower (i) makes a public announcement that it intends to consolidate or merge with any other corporation (other than a merger in which the Borrower is the surviving or continuing corporation and its capital stock is unchanged) or sell or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower or (ii) any person
 group or entity (including the Borrower) publicly announces a tender offer to purchase 50% or more of the Borrower&#8217;s Common Stock (or any other takeover scheme) (the date of the announcement referred to in clause (i) or (ii) is hereinafter referred to as the &#8220;Announcement Date&#8221;)
 then the Conversion Price shall
 effective upon the Announcement Date and continuing through the Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date (as defined below)
 be equal to the lower of (x) the Conversion Price which would have been applicable for a Conversion occurring on the Announcement Date and (y) the Conversion Price that would otherwise be in effect. From and after the Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date
 the Conversion Price shall be determined as set forth in this Section 1.2(a). For purposes hereof
 &#8220;Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date&#8221; shall mean
 with respect to any proposed transaction or tender offer (or



















takeover scheme) for which a public announcement as contemplated by this Section 1.2(b) has been made
 the date upon which the Borrower (in the case of clause (i) above) or the person
 group or entity (in the case of clause (ii) above) consummates or publicly announces the termination or abandonment of the proposed transaction or tender offer (or takeover scheme) which caused this Section 1.2(b) to become operative.


.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Borrower covenants that during the period the conversion right exists
 the Borrower will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares
 free from preemptive rights
 to provide for the issuance of Common Stock upon the full conversion of this Note issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The Borrower is required at all times to have authorized and reserved five times the number of shares that is actually issuable upon full conversion of the Note (based on the Conversion Price of the Notes in effect from time to time)(the &#8220;Reserved Amount&#8221;). The Reserved Amount shall be increased from time to time in accordance with the Borrower&#8217;s obligations hereunder. The Borrower represents that upon issuance
 such shares will be duly and validly issued
 fully paid and non-assessable. In addition
 if the Borrower shall issue any securities or make any change to its capital structure which would change the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Notes shall be convertible at the then current Conversion Price
 the Borrower shall at the same time make proper provision so that thereafter there shall be a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock authorized and reserved
 free from preemptive rights
 for conversion of the outstanding Notes. The Borrower (i) acknowledges that it has irrevocably instructed its transfer agent to issue certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note
 and 

If
 at any time the Borrower does not maintain the Reserved Amount it will be considered an Event of Default under Section 3.2 of the Note.














. Subject to Section 1.1
 this Note may be converted by the Holder in whole or in part at any time from time to time after the Issue Date
 by
submitting to the Borrower a Notice of Conversion (by facsimile
 e-mail or other reasonable means of communication dispatched on the Conversion Date prior to 6:00 p.m.
 New York
 New York time) and (B) subject to Section 1.4(b)
 surrendering this Note at the principal office of the Borrower.


. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein
 upon conversion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof
 the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Borrower unless the entire unpaid principal amount of this Note is so converted. The Holder and the Borrower shall maintain records showing the principal amount so converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method
 reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Borrower
 so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon each such conversion. In the event of any dispute or discrepancy
 such records of the Borrower shall
facie




















the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 if any portion of this Note is converted as aforesaid
 the Holder may not transfer this Note unless the Holder first physically surrenders this Note to the Borrower
 whereupon the Borrower will forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of the Holder a new Note of like tenor
 registered as the Holder (upon payment by the Holder of any applicable transfer taxes) may request
 representing in the aggregate the remaining unpaid principal amount of this Note. The Holder and any assignee
 by acceptance of this Note
 acknowledge and agree that
 by reason of the provisions of this paragraph
 following conversion of a portion of this Note
 the unpaid and unconverted principal amount of this Note represented by this Note may be less than the amount stated on the face hereof.


. The Borrower shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock or other securities or property on conversion of this Note in a name other than that of the Holder (or in street name)
 and the Borrower shall not be required to issue or deliver any such shares or other securities or property unless and until the person or persons (other than the Holder or the custodian in whose street name such shares are to be held for the Holder&#8217;s account) requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Borrower the amount of any such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower that such tax has been paid.

. Upon receipt by the Borrower from the Holder of a facsimile transmission or e-mail (or other reasonable means of communication) of a Notice of Conversion meeting the requirements for conversion as provided in this Section 1.4
 the Borrower shall issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered to or upon the order of the Holder certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion within three (3) business days after such receipt (the &#8220;Deadline&#8221;) (and
 solely in the case of conversion of the entire unpaid principal amount hereof
 surrender of this Note) in accordance with the terms hereof and the Purchase Agreement.


. Upon receipt by the Borrower of a Notice of Conversion
 the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion
 the outstanding principal amount and the amount of accrued and unpaid interest on this Note shall be reduced to reflect such conversion
 and
 unless the Borrower defaults on its obligations under this Article I
 all rights with respect to the portion of this Note being so converted shall forthwith terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock or other securities
 cash or other assets
 as herein provided
 on such conversion. If the Holder shall have given a Notice of Conversion as provided herein
 the Borrower&#8217;s obligation to issue and deliver the certificates for Common Stock shall be absolute and unconditional
 irrespective of the absence of any action by the Holder to enforce the same
 any waiver or consent with respect to any provision thereof
 the recovery of any judgment against any person or any action to enforce the same
 any failure or delay in the enforcement of any other obligation of the Borrower to the holder of record
 or any setoff
 counterclaim
 recoupment
 limitation or termination
 or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder of any obligation to the Borrower
 and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Borrower to the Holder in connection with such conversion. The Conversion Date specified in the Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion Date so long as the Notice of Conversion is received by the Borrower before 6:00 p.m.
 New York
 New York time
 on such date.



















.&#160;&#160;&#160;In lieu of delivering physical certificates representing the Common Stock issuable upon conversion
 provided the Borrower is participating in the Depository Trust Company (&#8220;DTC&#8221;) Fast Automated Securities Transfer (&#8220;FAST&#8221;) program
 upon request of the Holder and its compliance with the provisions contained in Section 1.1 and in this Section 1.4
 the Borrower shall use its best efforts to cause its transfer agent to electronically transmit the Common Stock issuable upon conversion to the Holder by crediting the account of Holder&#8217;s Prime Broker with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission (&#8220;DWAC&#8221;) system.


. Without in any way limiting the Holder&#8217;s right to pursue other remedies
 including actual damages and/or equitable relief
 the parties agree that if delivery of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note is not delivered by the Deadline (other than a failure due to the circumstances described in Section 1.3 above
 which failure shall be governed by such Section) the Borrower shall pay to the Holder $2
000 per day in cash
 for each day beyond the Deadline that the Borrower fails to deliver such Common Stock. Such cash amount shall be paid to Holder by the fifth day of the month following the month in which it has accrued or
 at the option of the Holder (by written notice to the Borrower by the first day of the month following the month in which it has accrued)
 shall be added to the principal amount of this Note
 in which event interest shall accrue thereon in accordance with the terms of this Note and such additional principal amount shall be convertible into Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this&#160;&#160;Note.&#160;&#160;The Borrower agrees that the right to convert is a valuable right to the Holder. The damages resulting from a failure
 attempt to frustrate
 interference with such conversion right are difficult if not impossible to qualify. Accordingly the parties acknowledge that the liquidated damages provision contained in this Section 1.4(g) are justified.


.&#160;&#160;The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note may not be sold or transferred unless (i) such shares are sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act or (ii) the Borrower or its transfer agent shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel (which opinion shall be in form
 substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions) to the effect that the shares to be sold or transferred may be sold or transferred pursuant to an exemption from such registration or (iii) such shares are sold or transferred pursuant to Rule 144 under the Act (or a successor rule) (&#8220;Rule 144&#8221;) or (iv) such shares are transferred to an &#8220;affiliate&#8221; (as defined in Rule 144) of the Borrower who agrees to sell or otherwise transfer the shares only in accordance with this Section 1.5 and who is an Accredited Investor (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). Except as otherwise provided in the Purchase Agreement (and subject to the removal provisions set forth below)
 until such time as the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note have been registered under the Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction as to the number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold
 each certificate for shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note that has not been so included in an effective registration statement or that has not been sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption that permits removal of the legend
 shall bear a legend substantially in the following form
 as appropriate:



















&#8220;NEITHER THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THESE SECURITIES ARE EXERCISABLE HAVE BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
 AS AMENDED
 OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE
 SOLD
 TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
 AS AMENDED
 OR (B) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL (WHICH COUNSEL SHALL BE SELECTED BY THE HOLDER)
 IN A GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE FORM
 THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT OR (II) UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 OR RULE 144A UNDER SAID ACT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING
 THE SECURITIES MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT OR OTHER LOAN OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENT SECURED BY THE SECURITIES.&#8221;


The legend set forth above shall be removed and the Borrower shall issue to the Holder a new certificate therefore free of any transfer legend if (i) the Borrower or its transfer agent shall have received an opinion of counsel
 in form
 substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions
 to the effect that a public sale or transfer of such Common Stock may be made without registration under the Act
 which opinion shall be accepted by the Company so that the sale or transfer is effected or (ii) in the case of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note
 such security is registered for sale by the Holder under an effective registration statement filed under the Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction as to the number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold. In the event that the Company does not accept the opinion of counsel provided by the Buyer with respect to the transfer of Securities pursuant to an exemption from registration
 such as Rule 144 or Regulation S
 at the Deadline
 it will be considered an Event of Default pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Note.














Merger

. At the option of the Holder
 the sale
 conveyance or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower
 the effectuation by the Borrower of a transaction or series of related transactions in which more than 50% of the voting power of the Borrower is disposed of
 or the consolidation
 merger or other business combination of the Borrower with or into any other Person (as defined below) or Persons when the Borrower is not the survivor shall either: (i) be deemed to be an Event of Default (as defined in Article III) pursuant to which the Borrower shall be required to pay to the Holder upon the consummation of and as a condition to such transaction an amount equal to the Default Amount (as defined in Article III) or (ii) be treated pursuant to Section 1.6(b) hereof. &#8220;Person&#8221; shall mean any individual
 corporation
 limited liability company
 partnership
 association
 trust or other entity or organization.


Merger
Consolidation
. If
 at any time when this Note is issued and outstanding and prior to conversion of all of the Notes
 there shall be any merger
&#160;&#160;consolidation
&#160;&#160;exchange&#160;&#160;of&#160;&#160;shares
&#160;&#160;recapitalization
&#160;&#160;reorganization
&#160;&#160;or&#160;&#160;other&#160;&#160;similar



















event
 as a result of which shares of Common Stock of the Borrower shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of another class or classes of stock or securities of the Borrower or another entity
 or in case of any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower other than in connection with a plan of complete liquidation of the Borrower
 then the Holder of this Note shall thereafter have the right to receive upon conversion of this Note
 upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore issuable upon conversion
 such stock
 securities or assets which the Holder would have been entitled to receive in such transaction had this Note been converted in full immediately prior to such transaction (without regard to any limitations on conversion set forth herein)
 and in any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of the Holder of this Note to the end that the provisions hereof (including
 without limitation
 provisions for adjustment of the Conversion Price and of the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Note) shall thereafter be applicable
 as nearly as may be practicable in relation to any securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the conversion hereof. The Borrower shall not affect any transaction described in this Section 1.6(b) unless (a) it first gives
 to the extent practicable
 thirty (30) days prior written notice (but in any event at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice) of the record date of the special meeting of shareholders to approve
 or if there is no such record date
 the consummation of
 such merger
 consolidation
 exchange of shares
 recapitalization
 reorganization or other similar event or sale of assets (during which time the Holder shall be entitled to convert this Note) and (b) the resulting successor or acquiring entity (if not the Borrower) assumes by written instrument the obligations of this Section 1.6(b). The above provisions shall similarly apply to successive consolidations
 mergers
 sales
 transfers or share exchanges.


. If the Borrower shall declare or make any distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of Common Stock as a dividend
 stock repurchase
 by way of return of capital or otherwise (including any dividend or distribution to the Borrower&#8217;s shareholders in cash or shares (or rights to acquire shares) of capital stock of a subsidiary (i.e.
 a spin-off)) (a &#8220;Distribution&#8221;)
 then the Holder of this Note shall be entitled
 upon any conversion of this Note after the date of record for determining shareholders entitled to such Distribution
 to receive the amount of such assets which would have been payable to the Holder with respect to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion had such Holder been the holder of such shares of Common Stock on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to such Distribution.


. If
 at any time when any Notes are issued and outstanding
 the Borrower issues or sells
 or in accordance with this Section 1.6(d) hereof is deemed to have issued or sold
 any shares of Common Stock for no consideration or for a consideration per share (before deduction of reasonable expenses or commissions or underwriting discounts or allowances in connection therewith) less than the Conversion Price in effect on the date of such issuance (or deemed issuance) of such shares of Common Stock (a &#8220;Dilutive Issuance&#8221;)
 then immediately upon the Dilutive Issuance
 the Conversion Price will be reduced to the amount of the consideration per share received by the Borrower in such Dilutive Issuance.

















The Borrower shall be deemed to have issued or sold shares of Common Stock if the Borrower in any manner issues or grants any warrants
 rights or options (not including employee stock option plans)
 whether or not immediately exercisable
 to subscribe for or to purchase Common Stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock (&#8220;Convertible Securities&#8221;) (such warrants
 rights and options to purchase Common Stock or Convertible Securities are hereinafter referred to as &#8220;Options&#8221;) and the price per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of such Options is less than the Conversion Price then in effect
 then the Conversion Price shall be equal to such price per share. For purposes of the preceding sentence
 the &#8220;price per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of such Options&#8221; is determined by dividing (i) the total amount
 if any
 received or receivable by the Borrower as consideration for the issuance or granting of all such Options
 plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration
 if any
 payable to the Borrower upon the exercise of all such Options
 plus
 in the case of Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of such Options
 the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration payable upon the conversion or exchange thereof at the time such Convertible Securities first become convertible or exchangeable
 by (ii) the maximum total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of all such Options (assuming full conversion of Convertible Securities
 if applicable). No further adjustment to the Conversion Price will be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon the exercise of such Options or upon the conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of such Options.


Additionally
 the Borrower shall be deemed to have issued or sold shares of Common Stock if the Borrower in any manner issues or sells any Convertible Securities
 whether or not immediately convertible (other than where the same are issuable upon&#160;&#160;the exercise of Options)
 and the price per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange is less than the Conversion Price then in effect
 then the Conversion Price shall be equal to such price per share. For the purposes of the preceding sentence
 the &#8220;price per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange&#8221; is determined by dividing (i) the total amount
 if any
 received or receivable by the Borrower as consideration for the issuance or sale of all such Convertible Securities
 plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration
 if any
 payable to the Borrower upon the conversion or exchange thereof at the time such Convertible Securities first become convertible or exchangeable
 by (ii) the maximum total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such Convertible Securities. No further adjustment to the Conversion Price will be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.

.&#160;&#160;&#160;If
 at any time when any Notes are issued and outstanding
 the Borrower issues any convertible securities or rights to purchase stock
 warrants
 securities or other property (the &#8220;Purchase Rights&#8221;) pro rata to the record holders of any class of Common Stock
 then the Holder of this Note will be entitled to acquire
 upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights
 the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder could have acquired if such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note (without regard to any limitations on conversion contained herein) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant
 issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights or
 if no such record is taken
 the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant
 issue or sale of such Purchase Rights.



















. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price as a result of the events described in this Section 1.6
 the Borrower
 at its expense
 shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment and prepare and furnish to the Holder a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Borrower shall
 upon the written request at any time of the Holder
 furnish to such Holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustment or readjustment
 (ii) the Conversion Price at the time in effect and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount
 if any

. This Note and any provision hereof may only be amended by an instrument in writing signed by the Borrower and the Holder. The term &#8220;Note&#8221; and all reference thereto
 as used throughout this instrument
 shall mean this instrument (and the other Notes issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement) as originally executed
 or if later amended or supplemented
 then as so amended or supplemented.

.&#160;&#160;This Note shall be binding upon the Borrower and its successors and assigns
 and shall inure to be the benefit of the Holder and its successors and assigns. Each transferee of this Note must be an &#8220;accredited investor&#8221; (as defined in Rule 501(a) of the 1933 Act). Notwithstanding anything in this Note to the contrary
 this Note may be pledged as collateral in connection with a

 the Borrower shall pay the Holder hereof costs of collection
 including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees.






















statute or rule of law
 then such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent that it may conflict therewith and shall be deemed modified to conform with such statute or rule of law. Any such provision which may prove invalid or unenforceable under any law shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of any agreement. Each party hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to process being served in any suit
 action or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or any other Transaction Document by mailing a copy thereof via registered or certified mail or overnight delivery (with evidence of delivery) to such party at the address in effect for notices to it under this Agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit in any way any right to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.


. Whenever pursuant to this Note the Borrower is required to pay an amount in excess of the outstanding principal amount (or the portion thereof required to be paid at that time) plus accrued and unpaid interest plus Default Interest on such interest
 the Borrower and the Holder agree that the actual damages to the Holder from the receipt of cash payment on this Note may be difficult to determine and the amount to be so paid by the Borrower represents stipulated damages and not a penalty and is intended to compensate the Holder in part for loss of the opportunity to convert this Note and to earn a return from the sale of shares of Common Stock acquired upon conversion of this Note at a price in excess of the price paid for such shares pursuant to this Note. The Borrower and the Holder hereby agree that such amount of stipulated damages is not plainly disproportionate to the possible loss to the Holder from the receipt of a cash payment without the opportunity to convert this Note into shares of Common Stock.


. By its acceptance of this Note
 each party agrees to be bound by the applicable terms of the Purchase Agreement.


. Except as otherwise provided below
 the Holder of this Note shall have no rights as a Holder of Common Stock unless and only to the extent that it converts this Note into Common Stock. The Borrower shall provide the Holder with prior notification of any meeting of the Borrower&#8217;s shareholders (and copies of proxy materials and other information sent to shareholders). In the event of any taking by the Borrower of a record of its shareholders for the purpose of determining shareholders who are entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution
 any right to subscribe for
 purchase or otherwise acquire (including by way of merger
 consolidation
 reclassification or recapitalization) any share of any class or any other securities or property
 or to receive any other right
 or for the purpose of determining shareholders who are entitled to vote in connection with any proposed sale
 lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower or any proposed liquidation
 dissolution or winding up of the Borrower
 the Borrower shall mail a notice to the Holder
 at least twenty (20) days prior to the record date specified therein (or thirty (30) days prior to the consummation of the transaction or event
 whichever is earlier)
 of the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend
 distribution
 right or other event
 and a brief statement regarding the amount and character of such dividend
 distribution
 right or other event to the extent known at such time. The Borrower shall make a public announcement of any event requiring notification to the Holder hereunder substantially simultaneously with the notification to the Holder in accordance with the terms of this Section 4.9.



















.&#160;&#160;&#160;The Borrower acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to the Holder
 by vitiating the intent and purpose of the transaction contemplated hereby. Accordingly
 the Borrower acknowledges that the remedy at law for a breach of its obligations under this Note will be inadequate and agrees
 in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Borrower of the provisions of this Note
 that the Holder shall be entitled
 in addition to all other available remedies at law or in equity
 and in addition to the penalties assessable herein
 to an injunction or injunctions restraining
 preventing or curing any breach of this Note and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof
 without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required.



IN WITNESS WHEREOF
 Borrower has caused this Note to be signed in its name by its duly authorized officer this March 13
 2014.































The undersigned hereby elects to convert $&#160;______________________________&#160;principal amount of the Note (defined below) into that number of shares of Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the conversion of the Note (&#8220;Common Stock&#8221;) as set forth below

(&amp;#147;AAEX&amp;#148;). In May 2010, AAEX changed its name to Accredited Members&#13;Holding Corporation (&amp;#147;AMHC&amp;#148;). On July 25, 2012, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization&#13;(the &amp;#147;Merger Agreement&amp;#148;) with Hangover Joe&amp;#146;s, Inc., a privately-held Colorado corporation (&amp;#147;HOJ&amp;#148;),&#13;whereby on July 25, 2012, the Company acquired HOJ in a reverse triangular merger (the &amp;#147;Acquisition&amp;#148;). Prior to the&#13;Acquisition, the Company had 36,807,801 shares outstanding. Upon closing the Acquisition, the Company issued 83,514,827 common&#13;shares to the HOJ shareholders in exchange for all of their ownership interests in HOJ such that the former owners of HOJ owned&#13;approximately 69% of the Company post Acquisition. The shareholders of the Company prior to the Acquisition owned approximately&#13;31% of the Company post Acquisition. In connection with the Acquisition on July 25, 2012, the Company changed its name to Hangover&#13;Joe&amp;#146;s Holding Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font-family: Helvetica...; text-indent: 0pt; margin: 0 13px&gt;&lt;br style=border-width: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica Neue Regular

The parties&#13;closed the Sale on July 27, 2012.

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0pt&gt;HOJ is a Colorado corporation&#13;formed on March 5, 2012. HOJ was formed for the purpose of acquiring all of the assets of both Hangover Joe&amp;#146;s Products LLC&#13;(&amp;#147;HOJ LLC&amp;#148;) and Hangover Joe&amp;#146;s Joint Venture (&amp;#147;HOJ JV&amp;#148;). HOJ LLC had conducted operations through&#13;HOJ JV, with the owner of HOJ LLC being one of the same owners and control persons of HOJ JV. Effective March 30, 2012, HOJ acquired&#13;the net assets of HOJ LLC and HOJ JV through the issuance of common stock of HOJ. Because HOJ had no significant assets or business&#13;operations prior to the merger and each of these entities were owned by the same control group, this transaction was accounted&#13;for as a reorganization of entities under common control. Accordingly, the historical results of operations of HOJ LLC and HOJ&#13;JV prior to March 30, 2012 are included in the results of operations of the Company.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font-family: Helvetica...; text-indent: 0pt; margin: 0 13px&gt;&lt;br style=border-width: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica Neue Regular

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0pt&gt;Because all of the operating&#13;businesses of AMHC were contemporaneously sold within five business days after the Acquisition, the transaction has been accounted&#13;for as a recapitalization of HOJ. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial position,&#13;results of operations and cash flows of HOJ and its predecessor entities, HOJ LLC and HOJ JV, prior to the date of Acquisition.&#13;The historical results of operations and cash flows of AMHC and the Subsidiaries prior to the date of the Acquisition have been&#13;excluded from the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The stockholders&amp;#146; equity of HOJ prior to the Acquisition&#13;has been retroactively restated for the equivalent number of shares received in the exchange after giving effect to any differences&#13;in the par value of the AMHC and HOJ common stock, with an offset to additional paid-in capital. The restated consolidated accumulated&#13;deficit of the accounting acquirer (HOJ) has been carried forward after the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font-family: Helvetica...; text-indent: 0pt; margin: 0 13px&gt;&lt;br style=border-width: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica Neue Regular

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0pt&gt;The accompanying consolidated&#13;financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company reported a net&#13;loss of approximately $2,189,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013, and a working capital deficiency and accumulated deficit&#13;of approximately $2,635,000 and $4,653,000, respectively, at December 31, 2013. The Company has a limited operating history and&#13;it has not generated any significant sales since the second quarter of 2013, and it has relied primarily on debt financing and&#13;private placements of its common stock to fund its operations; however,&amp;#160;due to a lack of liquidity, the Company has had difficulty&#13;in paying its obligations and is in default on its revolving credit facility and&amp;#160;other debt&amp;#160;(Note 3), and the Company&#13;cannot provide any assurance it will be able to remedy the default or be able to raise funds through a future issuance of debt&#13;or equity to carry out its business plan. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company&amp;#146;s ability to continue&#13;as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability&#13;and classification of assets, or the amounts or classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the&#13;Company to continue as a going concern.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 as a corporation
 the Company now records a provision for deferred income tax assets and liabilities in order to reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between (i) the tax basis of assets and liabilities and (ii) their reported amounts in the financial statements.  The provision is based upon enacted tax laws and rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.  The Company establishes a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.  Although the Company is to file income tax returns in the US Federal jurisdiction and various State jurisdictions
 the Company has not filed income tax returns for the year ended December 31

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0pt&gt;Beginning in March 2012, as&#13;a corporation, the Company now records a provision for deferred income tax assets and liabilities in order to reflect the net tax&#13;effects of temporary differences between (i) the tax basis of assets and liabilities and (ii) their reported amounts in the financial&#13;statements. The provision is based upon enacted tax laws and rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected&#13;to affect taxable income. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to&#13;the amounts expected to be realized. Although the Company is to file income tax returns in the US Federal jurisdiction and various&#13;State jurisdictions, the Company has not filed income tax returns for the year ended December 31, 2012; however, as no taxes are&#13;estimated to be due, management does not believe these non-filings will have a material impact on the Company&amp;#146;s consolidated&#13;financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font-family: Helvetica...; text-align: left; text-indent: 0pt; margin: 0&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

All tax years remain open and subject to U.S. Federal tax examination.

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0pt&gt;Basic net loss per share is&#13;computed by dividing the net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding&#13;for the period. Historical loss per share of the accounting acquirer (HOJ) has been adjusted retroactively to reflect the new capital&#13;structure of the Company as a result of the Merger Agreement. Diluted net loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could&#13;occur if dilutive securities were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then&#13;shared in the earnings of the Company, unless the effect of such inclusion would reduce a loss or increase earnings per share.&#13;For each of the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the effect of the inclusion of dilutive&#13;shares would have resulted in a decrease in loss per share. Stock options, warrants, common shares underlying convertible preferred&#13;stock and convertible notes payable in the aggregate of 16,034,287 and 10,355,726 shares as of and for the year ended December&#13;31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, were not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per common share because the effect would&#13;have been anti-dilutive.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font-family: Helvetica...; text-align: left; text-indent: 0pt; margin: 0&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0pt&gt;In December 2013, the Company&#13;received $25,000 from JSJ Investments Inc. (&amp;#147;JSJ&amp;#148;) in exchange for a $25,000 convertible note (the &amp;#147;JSJ Note&amp;#148;).&#13;This note bears interest at 12% per annum and matures in May 2014.

The&#13;conversion price is at 50% discount of the average of the three lowest closing prices on the previous ten days, with a maximum&#13;conversion price equal to the price if determined on the note execution date.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font-family: Helvetica...; text-align: left; text-indent: 0pt; margin: 0&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font-family: Helvetica...; text-align: left; text-indent: 0pt; margin: 0 13px&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0pt&gt;In November 2012, the Company&#13;entered into a consulting agreement with The Bricktown Group (&amp;#147;Bricktown&amp;#148;) to provide beverage management and strategic&#13;advisory consulting services to the Company. The managing partner of Bricktown was appointed as the Company&amp;#146;s Chief Operating&#13;Officer (COO) in March 2013, and served as the Company&amp;#146;s COO until August 6, 2013. This consulting agreement had an initial&#13;term of six months and was automatically extented through November 2013. The agreement required the Company to pay an upfront retainer&#13;of $10,000 and monthly consulting fees of $10,000 per month, which was to be deferred until the Company raised at least $300,000&#13;in debt or equity. The Company was to issue 3,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock in two tranches, of which 1,500,000&#13;shares were issuable upon request after January 4, 2013 and 1,500,000 shares were issuable on March l, 2013. The first 1,500,000&#13;shares are non-forfeitable and fully vested on the date of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font-family: Helvetica...; text-indent: 0pt; margin: 0 13px&gt;&lt;br style=border-width: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica Neue Regular

 Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0pt&gt;Based upon the terms of the&#13;agreement, the Company determined that the measurement date for the initial 1,500,000 shares to be issued under the agreement is&#13;the contract date and calculated a fair value of $225,000 based upon the closing market price on this date. Accordingly, the Company&#13;recorded an accrued consulting cost liability of $225,000 on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2012 until such&#13;shares are issued. The stock-based compensation associated with the initial shares of $225,000 was recorded as prepaid consulting&#13;costs and was amortized over the initial three months of this agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company recognized&#13;consulting expense of $278,616 related to this agreement. The measurement date for the second tranche of 1,500,000 shares was March&#13;1, 2013. The fair value of these shares of $135,000 was determined based upon the closing market price of the Company&amp;#146;s common&#13;stock on this date and was amortized over the remaining term of the contract. On January 10, 2013, the Company issued the initial&#13;1,500,000 shares of its common stock to Bricktown. The second tranche of shares have not been issued as of December 31, 2013, and&#13;therefore a liability of $135,000 has been included within accrued expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font-family: Helvetica...; text-indent: 0pt; margin: 0 13px&gt;&lt;br style=border-width: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica Neue Regular

The Company intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit and prosecute&#13;its cause of action.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font-family: Helvetica...; text-indent: 0pt; margin: 0 13px&gt;&lt;br style=border-width: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica Neue Regular

Inventory financing and factoring
arrangements

In
September 2012
 the Company entered into a factoring agreement with a finance company which provided financing up to $250
000
secured by the accounts receivable and inventory of the Company. The finance company advanced to the Company up to 80% of eligible
accounts receivable and was entitled to collect receivables directly from the Company&#146;s customers. The Company paid a financing
fee equal to 2.5% for receivable amounts outstanding up to 30 days and an additional rate of 0.084% per day (30.7% annualized)
after the initial 30 days with a maximum exposure of 60 days.

In
October 2012
 the Company entered into a purchase order financing arrangement with this same finance company which supplemented
the factoring agreement above. The finance company advanced up to 100% of the manufacturing and shipping costs at the time a Company
purchase order was submitted to the manufacturer. The Company paid a financing fee equal to 3.85% of the purchase order amount
for each transaction and an additional rate of 0.13% per day (47.4% annualized) after the initial 30 days. As of December 31
 2012
the inventory financing payable under the purchase order financing and factoring arrangement was $97
611. Amounts outstanding under
this agreement were paid in full in January 2013 when the Company entered into the revolving credit facility.





 2013
 the Company
entered into a senior secured lending arrangement with TCA Global Credit Master Fund
 LP (&#147;TCA&#148;) for up to a maximum
borrowing of $6
000
000. The credit facility provided for an initial line of credit of $425
000 based upon accounts receivable
and projected sales and is to be used only as permitted under the specified use of proceeds for working capital purposes. The initial
line of credit had a six month term from the date of closing with a six month renewal option. The lending arrangement is secured
by all of the assets of the Company and restricts the Company from paying dividends. As a partial guaranty under the TCA lending
arrangement
 the Company&#146;s CEO personally guaranteed certain representations made by the Company to TCA. At closing
 the
Company was advanced $425
000 less fees and closing costs.


above
 TCA charged an investment banking fee consisting of 125
000 shares of newly authorized Series B Preferred Shares of the
Company equating to an aggregate of $125
000 in the Company&#146;s capital stock. The shares are mandatorily redeemable and were
scheduled to be repaid in 2013. Also in connection with the TCA agreement
 the Company issued 194
954 shares of common stock to
a consulting firm as consideration for a finder&#146;s fee for this transaction.

The Company is in default in its agreement with TCA (Note 6).

Mandatorily Redeemable Series
B Preferred Stock



 2013
 the Board
of Directors approved the authorization of 125
000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock (the &#147;Series B Preferred Stock&#148;).
In connection with the TCA transaction
 the Company issued 125
000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to TCA. The Series B Preferred
Stock ranks pari passu to the Company&#146;s common stock. The Holder of outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to notice of any shareholders&#146; meeting and to vote as a single class with the Common Stock upon any matter submitted
for approval by the holders of common stock. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall have one vote per share. All outstanding
shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to be paid the &#147;Liquidation Preference
&#148; which is defined and calculated
as follows: $125
000 in the aggregate (not on a per share basis)
 payable monthly at various amounts.&#160; In 2013
 $57
000 was
paid
 and the remaining balance of $67
500 is due in full by virtue of the TCA default discussed above. The mandatorily redeemable
preferred stock is presented as a current liability in the accompanying December 31
 2013 balance sheet.

on a 12%
 12-month convertible promissory note with JMJ Financial (&#147;JMJ&#148;) (the &#147;JMJ Note&#148;). The face amount

Principles
of Consolidation

consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its 100%-owned subsidiary.&#160;&#160;All intercompany
accounts
 transactions
 and profits are eliminated in consolidation.


        
Use
of Estimates

of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

estimates are used in accounting for certain items such as allowance for doubtful accounts
 revenue recognition
 and stock-based
compensation. Estimates are based on historical experience
 where applicable
 and assumptions that management believes are reasonable
under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates
 actual results may differ.


        
Accounts Receivable and Concentration
of Credit Risk



to credit risk through trade receivables. This credit risk has been mitigated by the diversification of the Company&#146;s operations
as well as its customer base. The Company grants varying payment terms to its customers. Payment terms for customers can vary from
due upon receipt up to net 45 days.


78% of the trade accounts receivable at December 31
 2012; these individual customer balances represent approximately 65%
 and
13% of the total trade accounts receivable. Two customers accounted for approximately 20% of net sales for the year ended December
31
 2013; each of these individual customers&#146; sales represent approximately 10%&#160;of annual net sales. Four customers
accounted for 54% of net sales for the year ended December 31
 2012; these individual customers&#146; sales represent approximately
19%
 16%
 10% and 10% of annual net sales.


customers&#146; financial condition are performed. Collateral is not required. The Company maintains an allowance when necessary
for doubtful accounts that is the Company&#146;s best estimate of potentially uncollectible trade receivables. Provisions are
made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices that are considered potentially uncollectible in whole
or in part. For those invoices not specifically reviewed or considered uncollectible
 general provisions are provided at different
rates
 based upon the age of the receivable
 historical experience
 and other currently available evidence. The allowance estimates
are adjusted as additional information becomes known or as payments are made. As of December 31
 2013
 the allowance for doubtful
accounts was $146
604
 and at December 31
 2012
 the allowance for doubtful accounts was $21
624.


        
        
Inventory


of cost (first-in
 first-out) or market value. The inventory at December 31
 2012 primarily consisted of packing supplies. The
Company has no inventory on hand at December 31
 2013.


        
        


The
Company has a license with Warner Bros. Consumer Products
 Inc. (&#147;WBCP&#148;) that allows the Company the use of the costumes
artwork
 logos and other elements depicted in the 2009 movie
The
and the 2012 movie

.&#160;&#160;This license
 as amended
expires January 31
 2016.&#160;&#160;The terms of the WBCP license provide for royalties based on a percentage of products sold
as defined
 as well as agreed-upon guaranteed minimum royalties. Guaranteed minimum royalty payments are made periodically over
the term of the license and are recorded when paid as an asset&#160;&#160;in the balance sheet.&#160;&#160;The asset&#160;&#160;is
amortized to expense as revenue from the related products is recognized.&#160;&#160;If management determines that all or a portion
of the minimum guaranteed amounts appear not to be recoverable through future product sales
 the non recoverable portion is charged
to expense at that time&#160;&#160;The WBCP license agreement contains various convenants
 terms and conditions
 the violation
of which could result in the termination of the WBCP License.


        
Revenue
Recognition

transactions. The Company also offers its products for sale through its website at 

recognizes revenue when all of the following have occurred: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery to third
party distributors and consumers via the Company&#146;s website has occurred; (3) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and
(4) collectability is reasonably assured. Delivery is not considered to have occurred until the title and the risk of loss passes
to the customer according to the terms of the contract between the Company and the customer. For sales to distributors
 revenue
is usually recognized at the time of delivery. The Company defers revenues on products sold to distributors for which there is
a lack of credit history or if the distribution may be in a new market in which the Company has no prior experience. The Company
defers revenue in these situations until cash is received. For sales through the Company&#146;s website
 revenue is recognized
at time of shipment.

 with regards
to its determination of gross versus net reporting of revenue for transactions with customers. The Company sells
 through its website
Hangover Joe&#146;s Recovery Shots. In these transactions
 management has determined that the Company (i) acts as principal; (ii)
has the risks and rewards of ownership
 including the risk of loss for collection
 delivery or returns; and (iii) has latitude
in establishing price with the customer. For these transactions
 the Company recognizes revenue on a gross basis.

offers a variety of incentives and discounts to distributors
 customers and consumers through various programs to support the distribution

 price allowances
volume based rebates and product placement fees. These incentives and discounts are reflected as a reduction of gross sales to
arrive at net sales. The aggregate deductions from gross sales recorded in relation to these programs were approximately $1
800 and
$43
100 for the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012
 respectively.


        
Cost
of Goods Sold

 co-packing fees
 and in-bound freight charges. Raw material costs generally account for the largest portion of the cost of goods sold. Raw materials include bottles
 ingredients and packaging materials. The manufacturer is responsible for the ingredients. Costs of goods sold also include obsolescence charges and license and royalty expenses.



        
Supplier/Manufacturer
Concentration

relies on its third-party suppliers for raw materials necessary for its products
 and it relies on third-party manufacturers for
the production of its product.&#160;&#160;Although the Company believes that it could utilize alternative suppliers and manufacturers
any delay in locating and establishing relationships with other suppliers/manufacturers could result in product shortages and
back orders for the products
 with a resulting loss of net sales and profitability.&#160;&#160;The Company&#146;s third-party
manufacturer acquires some ingredients from suppliers outside of the United States.&#160;&#160;Purchasing these ingredients is
subject to the risks generally associated with importing raw materials from other countries
 including
 among other factors
 delays
in shipments
 changes in economic and political conditions
 quality assurance
 tariffs
 trade disputes and foreign currency fluctuations.&#160;&#160;These
factors could result in a delay in or disruption of the supply of certain raw materials.&#160;&#160;Any significant delay in or
disruption of the supply of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s business.


        
Sales
and Marketing Expenses

and marketing costs include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing
expenses after manufacture
 as well as expenses for advertising
 sampling and in-store demonstration costs
 costs for merchandise
displays
 point-of-sale materials
 trade shows
 other marketing expenses and product design expenses.


        
Advertising
Expenses

costs are expensed as incurred and are included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations. Total advertising expenses were approximately $102
000 and $122
000 for the years&#160;&#160;ended December 31
 2013
and&#160;&#160;2012
 respectively.


        
Income
Taxes

to March 2012
 no provision for income taxes was provided in the accompanying financial statements because HOJ LLC (as a limited
liability company)
 and HOJ JV (as a partnership)
 elected to file as partnerships
 and therefore management believes that prior
to December 31
 2012 the Company was not subject to income taxes
 and
 that such taxes were the responsibility of the individual
member/partners.

 as a corporation
 the Company now records a provision for deferred income tax assets and liabilities in order to reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between (i) the tax basis of assets and liabilities and (ii) their reported amounts in the financial statements.  The provision is based upon enacted tax laws and rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.  The Company establishes a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.  Although the Company is to file income tax returns in the US Federal jurisdiction and various State jurisdictions
 the Company has not filed income tax returns for the year ended December 31
 2012; however
 as no taxes are estimated to be due
 management does not believe these non-filings will have a material impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements.


assesses the likelihood of the financial statement effect of a tax position that should be recognized when it is more likely than
not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority based on the technical merits of the tax position
circumstances
 and information available as of the reporting date.&#160;&#160;All tax years remain open and subject to U.S. Federal
tax examination.&#160;&#160;Management does not believe that there are any current tax positions that would result in an asset
or liability for taxes being recognized in the accompanying financial statements.




        
Stock-Based
Compensation

 typically the Black-Scholes model.



        
Net
Loss per Share

 unless the effect of such inclusion would reduce a loss or increase earnings per share. For each of the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
 the effect of the inclusion of dilutive shares would have resulted in a decrease in loss per share. Stock options
 warrants
 common shares underlying convertible preferred stock and convertible notes payable in the aggregate of 16
034
287 and 10
355
726 shares as of and for the year ended December 31
 2013 and 2012 
 respectively
 were not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per common share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.



        
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

 where available.


The three levels of inputs required by the standard that the Company uses to measure fair value are summarized below.


    
    




    
    




    
    



fair value accounting
 assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement. As of December 31
 2013 and December 31
 2012
 the Company had no financial assets or liabilities
required to be reported for fair value purposes.&#160;

 including cash
 accounts receivable
 notes and accounts payable
 the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock
 and the inventory financing payable approximate fair value at December 31
 2013 and December 31
 2012
 due to the relatively short maturity of the respective instruments. The fair value of related party payables is not practicable to estimate due to the related party nature of the underlying transactions.

 the Company issued 4
500
000
and 1
500
000 common shares for the accrued settlement costs and accrued consulting costs
 respectively (Note 6).






 the Company
entered into an investor relations agreement with a firm which required the Company to pay a consulting fee of $2
500 per month
and to provide 100
000 shares of the Company's common stock per month and warrants to purchase 100
000 shares of the Company&#146;s
common stock per month. Based on the terms of the agreement
 the Company determined that the measurement date of the shares to
be issued is on the dates that the shares are earned
 which is monthly. Total compensation expense under this agreement for 2013
is $37
000. As the shares of common stock issuable under this agreement have not been issued as of December 31
 2013
 the Company
has recorded an accrued expense of $37
000 on the consolidated balance sheet until such shares are issued.
