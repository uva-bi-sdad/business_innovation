 movie series from Warner Brothers. The Company sells its products primarily to convenience stores
 liquor stores
 and grocery stores through distribution agreements
 as well as through online internet sales. The Company began selling an original hangover recovery shot in February 2011 and later

Hangover Joe&#8217;s Holding Corporation (&#8220;HJHC&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was originally incorporated in the State of Colorado in December 2005 as Across American Real Estate Exchange
 Inc. (&#8220;AAEX&#8221;) to facilitate the exchange of real estate properties between individuals under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code.&#160;&#160;In February 2010
 Accredited Members
 Inc. (&#8220;AMI&#8221;)
 a provider of investor research and management services
 was merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAEX
 and AMI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.&#160;&#160;In May 2010
 AAEX changed its name to Accredited Members Holding Corporation (&#8220;AMHC&#8221;).


On July 25
 2012
 the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) with Hangover Joe&#8217;s
 Inc.
 a privately-held Colorado corporation (&#8220;HOJ&#8221;)
 whereby on July 25
 2012
 AMHC acquired HOJ in a reverse triangular merger (the &#8220;Acquisition&#8221;).&#160;&#160;Upon closing the Acquisition the AMHC issued 83
514
827 common shares to the HOJ shareholders in exchange for all of their ownership interests in HOJ such that the former owners of HOJ owned approximately 69% of the Company post Acquisition.&#160;&#160;The shareholders of the AMHC prior to the Acquisition owned approximately 31% of the Company post Acquisition.&#160;&#160;In connection with the Acquisition on July 25
 2012
 AMHC changed its name to Hangover Joe&#8217;s Holding Corporation.
















The Merger Agreement further provided that within five business days after the closing of the Acquisition
 the Company would sell to Accredited Members Acquisition Corporation (&#8220;Buyer&#8221;) all of the equity interests in three of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries (the &#8220;Sale&#8221;)
 being AMI
 AMHC Managed Services
 Inc. and World Wide Premium Packers
 Inc. (collectively
 the &#8220;Subsidiaries&#8221;).&#160;&#160;Buyer is a privately-held Colorado corporation owned by two former directors of the Company
 JW Roth and David Lavigne.&#160;&#160;The parties closed the Sale on July 27
 2012.&#160;&#160;The Buyer paid $10
044 and assumed all liabilities related to the business of the Subsidiaries in exchange for all of the shares in the Subsidiaries owned by the Company.


HOJ is a Colorado corporation formed on March 5
 2012.&#160;&#160;HOJ was formed for the purpose of acquiring all of the assets of both Hangover Joe&#8217;s Products LLC (&#8220;HOJ LLC&#8221;) and Hangover Joe&#8217;s Joint Venture (&#8220;HOJ JV&#8221;).&#160;&#160;HOJ LLC had conducted operations through HOJ JV
 with the owner of HOJ LLC being one of the same owners and control persons of HOJ JV. Effective March 30
 2012
 HOJ acquired the net assets of HOJ LLC and HOJ JV through the issuance of common stock of HOJ.&#160;&#160;Because HOJ had no significant assets or business operations prior to the merger and each of these entities were owned by the same control group
 this transaction was accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 the historical results of operations of HOJ LLC and HOJ JV prior to March 30
 2012 are included in the results of operations of the Company.


Because all of the operating businesses of AMHC were sold within five business days after the Acquisition
 the transaction has been accounted for as a recapitalization of HOJ.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial position
 results of operations and cash flows of HOJ and its predecessor entities
 HOJ LLC and HOJ JV
 prior to the date of the Acquisition. The historical results of operations and cash flows of AMHC and the Subsidiaries prior to the date of the Acquisition have been excluded from the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The historical stockholders&#8217; equity of HOJ prior to the Acquisition has been retroactively restated for the equivalent number of shares received in the exchange after giving effect to any differences in the par value of the AMHC and HOJ common stock
 with an offset to additional paid-in capital.&#160;&#160;The restated consolidated accumulated deficit of the accounting acquirer (HOJ) has been carried forward after the exchange.

The hangover recovery drink category is a new and emerging category within the energy drink and shot market.&#160;&#160;The hangover recovery segment is relatively new and is primarily composed of a number of smaller manufacturers of recovery shots and drinks including NOHO
 GTOX
 Hangover Gone
 Last Call
 Mercy
 and Last Round.


The energy drink and shot market is a larger more established market segment and is currently dominated by well-known companies such as
 Red Bull
 Monster Energy
 and Rockstar Energy Drinks.&#160;&#160;According to Mintel International
 sales of energy drinks and shots in 2011 totaled about $7 billion.&#160;&#160;Sales of energy shots are expected to grow 98% between 2011 ($1.3 billion) and 2016 ($2.5 billion)
 representing a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 15 percent.
















The energy shot market is primarily dominated by 5-Hour Energy with Stacker 2 6-Hour Power
 and Red Bull Energy Shots all competing for a smaller stake in this market.&#160;&#160;Beverage Digest reported that 5-hour Energy
 which overwhelmingly dominates the energy shots category
 grew about 23% in 2011 across all four channels: convenience stores
 drug stores
 mass merchandisers and supermarkets.


The Company intends to ride this significant growth trend in the energy shot market and to lead a new $200+ million recovery drink category
 separate and distinct from energy shots.&#160;&#160;The Company believes our license with the Hangover movie series provides us with a significant branding advantage.&#160;&#160;Further
 we believe our taste profile is superior to the taste profile of other energy shots and hangover recovery products.




We do not directly manufacture our products
 but instead outsource the manufacturing process to third party laboratory and co-packing facility. Our co-packaging arrangements are terminable upon notice and do not obligate us to produce any minimum quantities of products within specified periods.




Our Hangover Joe&#8217;s Recovery Shot formula is currently manufactured by a third party laboratory in the United States.&#160;&#160;The third party laboratory is responsible for purchasing all raw material ingredients for our product including flavors
 dietary ingredients
 special herbs and supplements.&#160;&#160;The product is blended to our formula using specially filtered water.&#160;&#160;Once blended
 the liquid is then shipped to our co-packing facility.




Our Hangover Joe&#8217;s Recovery Shot liquid is bottled and packaged at a co-packing facility in the central United States. We generally are responsible for arranging for the purchase and delivery of labels and packaging materials to our third party co-packers.&#160;&#160;The co-packing facility provides bottles and caps
 and packages the product according to our specifications.&#160;&#160;Finished goods are maintained at the co-packing facility until shipment to our customers.


Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth
 particularly in new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products and/or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including
 but not limited to plastic shot bottles
 caps
 labels
 flavors
 dietary ingredients
 and other ingredients we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis.


 if at all
 a lengthy disruption or delay in production of our products could significantly affect our revenues. As we grow
 we will continue to actively seek alternative and/or additional advantageously located co-packing facilities in the United States with adequate capacity and capability for the production of our various products to minimize transportation costs and transportation-related damages as well as to mitigate the risk of a disruption in production.




During 2012
 we continued to expand the distribution of our product in both domestic and international markets. With very little marketing and public relations activities to date
 the Company has rapidly expanded the distribution of Hangover Joe&#8217;s Recovery Shot to over 15
000 accounts in the United States
 and recently entered into distribution agreements in Australia
 New Zealand and Canada. The Company has determined that convenience store distributors provide a solid foundation for building our distribution network within the United States.&#160;&#160;In addition
 liquor and tobacco distributors also provide an advantage as two distinct groups facing general volume decline in their core products (beer and tobacco)
 hence the need for new products which can quickly ramp sales. Concurrently
 we also are pursuing relationship with mass merchandisers such as Walmart
 Target
 CVS
 Walgreens
 Kmart and national /regional supermarket chains.


The Company currently has over 40 distributors with over 15
000 retail accounts and growing.&#160;&#160;Many of the well-known established retail chains who currently offer Hangover Joe&#8217;s include 7-Eleven
 RaceTrac
 Loves Truck Stops
 Valero Corner Stores
 Hastings Entertainment
 MGM Resorts
 Harrah&#8217;s
 Terrible Herbst Gas Stations
 Aloha Gas
 Long's Drugs
 Kwik Shops
 select Bed Bath &amp; Beyond
 Stripes Convenience stores with more pending.


Also
 based upon recent successes and increasing international distributor agreements in Australia
 New Zealand and Canada
 the Company believes the international markets to be a game changing opportunity. Since the original Hangover movie and the Hangover Part II movie have been shown in over 40 countries we have received several unsolicited inquiries from distributors in the European Union and South East Asia.
















We continually seek to expand distribution of our products by entering into agreements with other regional or direct store delivery distributors with established sales
 marketing and distribution organizations. Many of our distributors distribute other energy shot products. In many cases
 such products compete indirectly with our products.




 dietary ingredients and other packaging materials
 the costs of which are subject to fluctuations.&#160;&#160;Most of our raw materials are purchased by our manufacturing laboratory and co-packing facilities and included as part of the cost billed to the Company.&#160;&#160;Overall
 the Company did not experience any significant increase in costs charged by the manufacturing and co-packing facilities.


Generally
 raw materials utilized by us in our business are readily available from numerous sources. However
 the Company&#8217;s third-party manufacturer acquires some ingredients from suppliers outside of the United States.&#160;&#160;Purchasing these ingredients is subject to the risks generally associated with importing raw materials from other countries
 including
 among other factors
 delays in shipments
 changes in economic and political conditions
 quality assurance
 tariffs
 trade disputes and foreign currency fluctuations.&#160;&#160;These factors could result in a delay in or disruption of the supply of certain raw materials.&#160;&#160;Any significant delay in or disruption of the supply of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business.





The energy drink and energy shot market are highly competitive and the energy shot market in particular is dominated by 5-Hour Energy. The key areas of competition are pricing
 packaging
 development of new products and flavors as well as promotional and marketing strategies.&#160;&#160;Our product competes directly with other emerging recovery shot products. Currently these products are produced by smaller less established manufacturers.&#160;&#160;Our Hangover Recovery Shot also indirectly competes with other energy shot products from much larger well-known companies such as 5-Hour Energy
 Stacker 2
 and Red Bull. These more established energy shot companies have substantially greater financial
 marketing and distribution resources than we do.


Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include taste and flavor of products
 trade and consumer promotions
 rapid and effective development of new
 unique cutting edge products
 attractive and different packaging
 brand exposure and marketing as well as pricing. We also compete for distributors who will give our products more focus than those of our competitors
 provide stable and reliable distribution and secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets. Competitive pressures could cause our products to be unable to gain or to lose market share or we could experience price erosion
 which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.


We believe that our product compares favorably with other energy shot products because of our superior taste profile and powerful branding relationship with the Hangover movie series. In addition
 we are one of the few recovery shots taken next day.







Our sales and marketing strategy is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness through industry and distributor trade shows
 marketing at special events
 and product sampling. We utilize &#8220;push-pull&#8221; methods to enhance shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets (including advertising
 in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials
 racks
 and coolers) to increase demand from consumers for our products.


Our sales and marketing efforts are primarily focused on major metropolitan areas with strong entertainment cultures including New York
 Miami
 San Francisco
 Los Angeles
 San Diego
 Las Vegas
 New Orleans
 and Chicago.&#160;&#160;We also are focused on leveraging the marketing and sales value of 





As of the date of this Report
 our products can be found in the U. S. and in select international markets of Australia
 Canada
 and New Zealand.
















Domestically
 the Company sells its products primarily to convenience store
 liquor store
 and grocery store distributors
 as well as through online internet sales. Two convenience store distributors accounted for 28% of our annual net sales during 2012.


During 2012
 the Company entered into distribution agreements with international partners in Australia
 Canada
 and New Zealand.&#160;&#160;Net sales to our international partners accounted for 26% of our annual net sales during 2012.








 with slightly higher sales volumes during the holiday season in the fourth quarter.&#160;&#160;The Company also anticipates higher sales volume near the release of the Hangover III movie in May 2013.&#160;&#160;Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products
 the opening of new markets particularly international markets
 the addition of new distributors
 and increased or decreased advertising and promotional expenses.







The Company&#8217;s original license with Warner Bros. Consumer Products
 Inc. (&#8220;WBCP&#8221;) permits the Company to use the costumes
 artwork
 logos and other elements depicted in the 2009 movie
.&#160;&#160;This license had an initial term through January 31
 2013 and provided for certain royalties based on a percentage of products sold subject to certain agreed-upon guaranteed minimum royalty payments over the term of the license.


In January 2013
 the Company extended its product license agreement with WBCP to January 31
 2016. Further
 the extension added certain channels of distribution and added the costumes
 artwork
Similar to the initial agreement
 the extension required certain agreed-upon minimum royalty payments over the next three years
 the first of which was paid from the proceeds from the TCA revolving credit facility in January 2013.





The Company has a representative agreement with an individual who became a member of the Company&#8217;s board of directors in July 2012. Under this agreement
 as amended
 this individual is entitled to a commission of between 4% and 6% of sales made by this individual
 based on the nature of the sales
 and a royalty of 3% of all sales made by the Company

Our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material
 there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware
 or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material. The Company&#8217;s securities are highly speculative and involve a high degree of risk
 including among other items the risk factors described below.








 The Company was formed in December 2005 and its wholly-owned subsidiary was formed in March 2012. The Company has engaged in active business operations in a limited capacity through its predecessor entities. Therefore
 the Company is subject to many risks common to enterprises with limited operating history
 including potential under-capitalization
 limitations with respect to personnel
 financial and other resources
 and limited customers and revenue sources. The Company&#8217;s ability to successfully generate sufficient revenues from operations is dependent on a number of factors
 including availability of funds to fund its current and anticipated operations
 and to commercialize its business concept. There can be no assurance that the Company will not encounter setbacks with the on-going development and implementation of its business plan
 or that funding will be sufficient to allow it to fully implement its business plan. In addition
 the Company&#8217;s assumptions and projections may not prove to be accurate
 and unexpected capital needs may arise. If such needs arise
 the Company&#8217;s inability to raise additional funds
 either through equity or debt financing
 will materially impair its ability to implement its business plan and generate revenues. Further
 as a result of the recent volatility of the global markets
 a general tightening of lending standards
 and a general decrease in equity financing and similar type transactions
 it could be difficult for the Company to obtain funding to allow it to continue developing its business operations.

As a result of losses from operations and limited capital resources
 the Company&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm&#8217;s report on its consolidated financial statements as of
 and for the year ended
 December 31
 2012
 includes an explanatory paragraph discussing that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. the Company&#8217;s ability to continue to pursue our plan of operations as described herein is dependent upon our ability to increase our revenues and/or raise the capital necessary to meet our financial requirements on a continuing basis.


Section&#160;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management to assess our internal controls over financial reporting (&#8220;ICFR&#8221;) pursuant to a defined framework.&#160;&#160;In making that assessment
 management identified a material weakness in our disclosure controls as a result of several material weaknesses identified in our ICFR as described in Item 9A below.&#160;&#160;There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control
 and accordingly
 even effective ICFR can provide only reasonable assurance with respect of financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect misstatements.&#160;&#160;Material weaknesses make it more likely that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.&#160;&#160;In addition
 effective ICFR at any point in time may become ineffective in future periods because of changes in conditions or due to deterioration in the degree of compliance with our established policies and procedures.


The Company&#8217;s success will depend
 in large part
 on its ability to hire qualified and experienced executive officers
 managers

 attract
 hire
 train
 and/or retain such executive level personnel or the necessary administrative
 marketing and customer service personnel. Competition for such personnel can be intense and there is no certainty that the Company will be able to successfully attract
 integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. The failure to attract and retain the necessary personnel could have a materially adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business
 operations and financial condition.


The Company likely will need additional capital in the future

 among other things
 fund its operations and growth strategy. The Company may rely on bank financing and also may seek access to the debt and/or equity capital markets. There can be no assurance
 however
 that these sources of financing will be available on reasonable terms
 or at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital
 its growth could be significantly impeded and/or it may be unable to execute its business model.
















As a new business venture

 labor disputes
 governmental regulations
 equipment breakdowns
 costs of raw materials
 disputes with its manufacturers or distributors
 governmental regulatory interference and other disruptions. While the Company intends to manage these costs diligently
 the risk of running over budget is always significant and may have a substantial adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s profitability. In such event
 additional sales of the Company stock or additional financing may be required to continue the Company&#8217;s business
 and there can be no guaranty that the Company could successfully conclude such additional sales or obtain such additional financing at all or on terms acceptable to the Company
 which could have a materially adverse effect on the Company and its operations and result in the loss of some or all of the investor&#8217;s investment in the Company.

Because the Company depends on outside suppliers with whom the Company does not have long-term agreements for raw materials
 the Company may be unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for its products at favorable prices or at all
 which could result in product shortages and back orders for its products

 causing certain suppliers or the Company to discontinue
 change or suspend the sale of certain ingredients or components. Although the Company believes that it could establish alternate sources for most of these materials
 any delay in locating and establishing relationships with other sources could result in product shortages and back orders for the products
 with a resulting loss of net sales and profitability. The Company is also subject to delays associated with raw materials. These can be caused by conditions not within its control. The Company acquires some ingredients from suppliers outside of the United States. Purchasing these ingredients is subject to the risks generally associated with importing raw materials from other countries
 including
 among other factors
 delays in shipments
 changes in economic and political conditions
 quality assurance
 tariffs
 trade disputes and foreign currency fluctuations. These factors could result in a delay in or disruption of the supply of certain raw materials. Any significant delay in or disruption of the supply of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business.


Like other distributors of products that are ingested
 the Company faces an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of its products results in illness or injury. The products that the Company sells in the U.S. are subject to laws and regulations
 including those administered by the USDA and FDA that establish manufacturing practices and quality standards for food products. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business as existing insurance coverage may not be adequate. Distributors of vitamins
 nutritional supplements and minerals
 have been named as defendants in product liability lawsuits from time to time. The successful assertion or settlement of an uninsured claim
 a significant number of insured claims or a claim exceeding the limits of the Company&#8217;s insurance coverage would harm the Company by adding costs to its business and by diverting the attention of senior management from the operation of its business. The Company may also be subject to claims that its products contain contaminants
 are improperly labeled
 include inadequate instructions as to use or inadequate warnings covering interactions with other substances. Product liability litigation
 even if not meritorious
 is very expensive and could also entail adverse publicity for the Company and reduce its revenue. In addition
 the products the Company distributes
 or certain components of those products
 may be subject to product recalls or other deficiencies. Any negative publicity associated with these actions would adversely affect the Company&#8217;s brand and may result in decreased product sales and
 as a result
 lower revenues and profits.


 Various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements relating to the content or perceived adverse health consequences of the Company&#8217;s product. If these types of requirements become applicable to the Company&#8217;s product under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations
 they may inhibit sales of such products.


 The Company has contractual agreements with certain third-party distributors. Under the agreements
 these third parties control when and how often the Company&#8217;s products are offered and the Company is not guaranteed any minimum level of sales or transactions. Additionally
 some agreements contain exclusive rights in specified locations to promote the Company&#8217;s products during the contract term and for specified years thereafter. If any third party elects not to renew their agreement or reduces the promotion of the Company&#8217;s products
 the Company&#8217;s operating profits will suffer. Additionally
 in certain instances
 the Company could be prohibited from selling its products through competitors of these third parties for a specified time after the termination of the agreements.
















The Company&#8217;s business is subject to online security risks

 online commerce and communications must provide a secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Currently
 a limited number of the Company&#8217;s customers authorize the Company to bill their credit cards directly for all fees it charges. The Company relies on third party software products to secure its credit card transactions. Although the Company has developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent payment transactions and other security breaches
 failure to prevent or mitigate such fraud or breaches may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operating results.


 The Company&#8217;s business also depends on a number of third parties for Internet access
 and the Company has limited control over these third parties. Should the Company lose its network connections
 its ability to fulfill orders through its website would be delayed. Further
 if the Company&#8217;s website becomes unavailable for a noticeable period of time due to Internet or communication failures
 its business could be adversely affected
 including harm to its brand and loss of sales.


As a new business enterprise

 many of which are outside its control. As a result of the Company's lack of operating history it is difficult for the Company to forecast its revenues or earnings accurately. The Company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly
 any significant shortfall in revenues relative to the Company&#8217;s planned expenditures would have an immediate
 adverse effect on its business
 results of operations and financial condition.


If the Company fails to manage its growth effectively

 the Company will have to develop and enhance its systems
 procedures and controls and locate
 hire
 train and retain management and operating personnel. The Company cannot offer any assurance that it will be able to respond on a timely basis to all of the changing demands that its planned expansion will impose on its management and infrastructure. If the Company is unable to manage its growth effectively
 its business and operating results could be materially adversely impacted.


The Company is dependent on its key personnel
 The Company depends on the continued performance of its officers and directors
 particularly Michael Jaynes
 Michael Malm and Eric Skae
 who have contributed significantly to the expertise of the planning and development of the Company&#8217;s business. To date
 the Company has not entered into an employment agreement with any of its key personnel. If the Company loses the services of any key individuals and is unable to locate suitable replacements for such persons in a timely manner
 its business could be materially adversely affected. The Company does not expect to obtain key man life insurance for any members of management in the foreseeable future.


. Criticism of the Company&#8217;s product
 including criticism by healthcare professionals and other criticism for a variety of reasons
 could affect consumer opinions of its product and result in decreased demand
 which in turn could have an adverse effect on its results of operations and business.


 The business environment for the Company&#8217;s product is rapidly evolving as a result of
 among other things
 changes in consumer preferences
 including changes based on health and nutrition considerations; shifting consumer tastes and needs; changes in consumer lifestyles; and competitive product and pricing pressures. If the Company is unable to successfully adapt to this rapidly changing environment
 its business could be negatively affected.


If the Company&#8217;s intellectual property rights under the license agreement decline in popularity

 Inc.
 described above
 allows the use of the costumes
 artwork logos and other elements depicted in the 2009 movie &#8220;The Hangover and the 2011 movie &#8220;The Hangover II.&#8221; Currently these movies enjoy a great deal of popularity. The Company&#8217;s strategy has been to capitalize on the movies popularity as a marketing vehicle to sell the Company&#8217;s products. If these movies should suffer a decline in popularity
 the return on the Company&#8217;s marketing efforts will be significantly less than the Company has anticipated.


 The Company&#8217;s license agreement with Warner Bros. Consumer Products
 Inc.
 described above
 expires January 31
 2016. The agreement may be extended upon agreement of the parties
 but there is no assurance that the parties will be able to come to terms with an extension of the agreement. If the Company is required to rebuild its branding
 it could negatively affect the Company&#8217;s cash flow and business.
















If the Company is not able to effectively protect its intellectual property
 its business may suffer a material

 the Company&#8217;s business may be materially adversely affected. Further
 the Company cannot be sure that its activities do not and will not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. The Company&#8217;s predecessor
 the LLC
 experienced a patent infringement claim against the product formula it used
 and the LLC quickly changed its formula in response to those claims prior to any significant product sales occurring
 thereby minimizing any damage claims. If similar claims are made against the Company&#8217;s current product formula
 the Company may not be able to effectively minimize damage claims due to its significant sales pipeline. If the Company is compelled to prosecute infringing parties
 defend its intellectual property or defend itself from intellectual property claims made by others
 it may face significant expenses and liability as well as the diversion of management&#8217;s attention from the Company&#8217;s business
 any of which could negatively impact the Company&#8217;s business or financial condition.






The Company has no agreement with any broker or dealer to act as a market maker for its securities and there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining any market makers. Thus
 no broker or dealer will have an incentive to make a market for our stock. This in part
 has resulted in very low trading volume of our common stock.&#160;&#160;The lack of a market maker for our securities could adversely influence the market for and price of our securities
 as well as your ability to dispose of
 or to obtain accurate information about
 and/or quotations as to the price of
 our securities.

&#160;As our stock is not listed on a national securities exchange

 our stock is subject to rules adopted by the Commission regulating broker dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Those disclosure rules applicable to penny stocks require a broker dealer
 prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules
 to deliver a standardized list disclosure document prepared by the Commission. That disclosure document advises an investor that investment in penny stocks can be very risky and that the investor's salesperson or broker is not an impartial advisor but rather paid to sell the shares. The disclosure contains further warnings for the investor to exercise caution in connection with an investment in penny stocks, to independently investigate the security
 as well as the salesperson with which the investor is working and to understand the risky nature of an investment in this security. The broker dealer must also provide the customer with certain other information and must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. Further
 the rules require that
 following the proposed transaction
 the broker provide the customer with monthly account statements containing market information about the prices of the securities.

These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock. Many brokers may be unwilling to engage in transactions in our common stock because of the added disclosure requirements
 thereby making it more difficult for shareholders to dispose of their shares. You will also find it difficult to obtain accurate information about
 and/or quotations as to the price of
 our common stock.&#160;&#160;In general
 buying low-priced penny stocks is very risky and speculative.&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s common stock is currently defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934
 and rules thereunder.&#160;&#160; You may not be&#160;able to sell your shares when you want to do so
 if at all.&#160;&#160;Our shares are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934
 and rules of the Commission.&#160;&#160;The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors.&#160;&#160;Consequently
 the penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to make a market in or trade our common stock and may also affect your ability to resell any shares you may purchase in the public markets.

You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the public sale price. The securities of companies such as ours have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations during certain periods. These broad market fluctuations and other factors
 such as new product developments and trends in the our industry and in the investment markets generally
 as well as economic conditions and quarterly variations in our operational results
 may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.

 Having a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act is a time consuming and expensive process and subjects the company to increased regulatory scrutiny and extensive and complex regulation.&#160;&#160;Complying with these regulations is expensive and requires a significant amount of management&#8217;s time.&#160;&#160;For example
 public companies are obligated to institute and maintain financial accounting controls and for the accuracy and completeness of their books and records.&#160;&#160;These requirements necessitate additional corporate spending on procedures and personnel requiring us to reallocate funds from other business objectives.




























The Company and its subsidiary do not own or lease any real property.&#160;&#160;The Company utilizes a third party laboratory and separate co-packing facility to manufacture
 package and store its raw material and finished goods inventory on a short-term basis. Our co-packaging arrangements are generally are terminable upon notice and generally do not obligate us to rent or lease any warehouse space.

On October 24
 2012
 John Botdorf filed a complaint against Hangover Joe&#8217;s Inc.
 (Civil Action No. 1:11-CV-00391) in the District Court in El Paso County Colorado alleging Hangover Joe&#8217;s Inc entered into an employment contract with Mr. Botdorf as CEO and then breached the foregoing contract causing damages.&#160;&#160;On December 10
 2012
 AMHC Managed Services
 Inc.
 (&#8220;AMMS&#8221;) filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (AAA)
 naming Hangover Joe's Inc. as the respondent in Case Number AAA#77148Y0034812 alleging among other things
 breach of contract of a Management Services and Founders Agreement dated March 1
 2012.&#160;&#160;AMMS was seeking damages for unpaid Management fees of $27
500 per month from October 1
 2012 through February 28
 2014.


On January 14
 2013
 the Company and Hangover Joe&#8217;s Inc. entered into a settlement agreement and release with AMMS
 J.W Roth
 David Lavigne
 and Mr. Botdorf to settle the civil complaint and demand for arbitration discussed above. The parties agreed that the Management Services Contract was terminated effective October 1
 2012.&#160;&#160;In consideration
 the Company issued 3
000
000 shares of common stock to AMMS and 1
500
000 shares of common stock to John Botdorf.&#160;&#160;On January 15
 2013
 AMMS filed a notice of dismissal with prejudice with the AAA pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement. The Company believed both the civil complaint and the demand for arbitration were without merit
 but agreed to settle these legal matters to minimize further litigation costs and to allow management to focus on the business and operations of the Company.





On December 12
 2012
 the Company entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release with Applied Food Sciences
 Inc. (&#8220;Applied&#8221;) with respect to civil action 1:11-CV-00391 filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas Beaumont Division whereby the Company agreed to pay $5
000 in satisfaction of all claims.&#160;&#160;Applied claimed that the Company was infringing on its patent for the use of glucarate and its derivatives such as glucuronolactone.&#160;&#160;The Company believed this suit was frivolous and without merit
 but agreed to settle this suit to minimize further litigation costs.&#160;&#160;The Company believes glucarate or its derivatives are not effective or necessary in the relief or recovery of the symptoms of an alcohol induced hangover.&#160;&#160;As a result
 the Company removed any form of glucarate or its derivatives from early versions of its formula many years back and accordingly this settlement did not require the Company to modify or make any adjustments to its current formula.

The Company also has outstanding 87
501 shares of Series A Preferred Stock.&#160;&#160;Each share of Series A stock is currently convertible into 8 shares of Company common stock
 and each Series A share is entitled to 8 votes per share.&#160;&#160;The Series A stock votes as a single class with the Company&#8217;s common stock.


In January 2013
 the Company issued 125
000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into common shares based upon a formula equal to one divided by the average of the volume weighted average price for the common stock for the five business days immediately prior to the date a &#8220;Conversion Notice&#8221; (as defined) is provided to the Company. The Holder of outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote as a single class with the Common Stock and each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall have one vote per share.



As of April 8
 2013
 there were 255 holders of record of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock. This does not include persons who hold our common stock in brokerage accounts and otherwise in &#8220;street name.&#8221;



Since its inception the Company has not declared or paid cash or other dividends on its Common Stock.&#160;&#160;The Company has no plans to pay any dividends
 although it may do so if its&#8217; financial position changes.&#160;&#160;There are no restrictions in the Registrant&#8217;s articles of incorporation or bylaws that restrict it from declaring dividends

The Company&#8217;s shareholders approved the adoption of the 2009 Stock Option Plan (the &#8220;2009 Plan&#8221;) in March 2009.&#160;&#160;Initially
 a total of 2
603
000 shares of Company common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2009 Plan. On October 6
 2010
 the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the plan increasing the shares reserved for issuance under the plan to 7
000
000 shares (the &#8220;Amendment&#8221;).&#160;&#160;Although the Amendment received more than a majority of the votes cast at&#160;a meeting of shareholders held on December 15
 2010
 it did not receive a sufficient number of votes to be approved by the shareholders.&#160;&#160;The sole reason for seeking shareholder approval of the Amendment was to permit certain options granted pursuant to the Plan to qualify as Incentive Stock Options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code.&#160;&#160;The adoption of the Amendment itself was not subject to shareholder approval.&#160;&#160;As a result
 although the Amendment is effective
 since shareholder approval was not received within one year of the Amendment&#8217;s adoption by the Board
 options granted from those shares that are a part of the Amendment will not be eligible to be considered Incentive Stock Options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. As of December 31
 2012
 stock options to purchase 650
000 shares of common stock are outstanding under the 2009 Plan.
















On July 26
 2012
 the Company&#8217;s shareholders approved the 2012 Stock Option Plan (the &#8220;2012 Plan&#8221;). Under the Plan
 the Company may grant stock options
 restricted and other equity awarded to any employee

500
000 shares of common stock. As of December 31
 2012

266
190 shares of common stock are outstanding under the 2012 Plan.


In April 2013
 the Company&#8217; Board of Directors reduced the number of common shares reserved under the 2012 Stock Option Plan from 11
500
000 shares to 4
500
000 and reduced the number of common shares reserved under the 2009 Stock Option Plan from 7
000
000 shares to 650
000 shares.&#160;&#160;The reduction in shares reserved under the option plans was implemented to increase the number of common shares available for issuance for capital funding purposes.


The Company may grant stock options
 restricted and other equity awards to any employee
 consultant
 independent contractor
 director or officer of the Company pursuant to the terms outlined in the 2009 Plan and 2012 Plan.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The purpose of the equity compensation plans are to provide financial incentives for selected employees

Hangover Joe&#8217;s Holding Corporation (&#8220;HJHC&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was originally incorporated in the State of Colorado in December 2005 as Across American Real Estate Exchange
 Inc. (&#8220;AAEX&#8221;) to facilitate the exchange of real estate properties between individuals under section 1031 of the internal revenue code.&#160;&#160;In February 2010
 Accredited Members
 Inc. (&#8220;AMI&#8221;)
 a provider of investor research and management services
 was merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAEX
 and AMI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.&#160;&#160;In May 2010
 AAEX changed its name to Accredited Members Holding Corporation.
















On July 25
 2012
 the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) with Hangover Joe&#8217;s
 Inc.
 a privately-held Colorado corporation (&#8220;HOJ&#8221;)
 whereby on July 25
 2012
 the Company acquired HOJ in a reverse triangular merger (the &#8220;Acquisition&#8221;).&#160;&#160;Upon closing the Acquisition
 the Company issued 83
514
827 common shares to the HOJ shareholders in exchange for all of their ownership interests in HOJ such that the former owners of HOJ owned approximately 69% of the Company post Acquisition.&#160;&#160;The shareholders of the Company prior to the Acquisition owned approximately 31% of the Company post&#160;Acquisition.&#160;&#160;As a result of the Acquisition on July 25
 2012
 the Company changed its name to Hangover Joe&#8217;s Holding Corporation.


The Merger Agreement further provided that
 within five business days after the closing of the Acquisition the Company would sell to Accredited Members Acquisition Corporation (&#8220;Buyer&#8221;) all of the equity interests in three of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries (the &#8220;Sale&#8221;)
 being AMI.
 AMHC Managed Services
 Inc. and World Wide Premium Packers
 Inc. (collectively
 the &#8220;Subsidiaries&#8221;).&#160;&#160;Buyer is a privately-held Colorado corporation owned by two former directors of the Company
 JW Roth and David Lavigne.&#160;&#160;The parties closed the Sale on July 27
 2012.&#160;&#160;Buyer paid $10
044 and assumed all liabilities of the Subsidiaries in exchange for all of the shares in the Subsidiaries owned by the Company.


HOJ is a Colorado corporation formed on March 5
 2012.&#160;&#160;HOJ was formed for the purpose of acquiring all of the assets of both Hangover Joe&#8217;s Products LLC (&#8220;HOJ LLC&#8221;) and Hangover Joe&#8217;s Joint Venture (&#8220;HOJ JV&#8221;).&#160;&#160;HOJ LLC had conducted operations through HOJ JV
 with the owner of HOJ LLC being one of the same owners and control persons of HOJ JV. Effective March 30
 2012
 HOJ acquired the net assets of HOJ LLC and HOJ JV through the issuance of common stock of HOJ.&#160;&#160;Because HOJ had no significant assets or business operations prior to the merger and each of these entities were owned by the same control group
 this transaction was accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 the historical results of operations of HOJ LLC and HOJ JV are included in the results of operations of the Company.

Because all of the operating businesses of AMHC were contemporaneously sold within five business days after the Acquisition
 the transaction has been accounted for as a recapitalization of HOJ.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 the accompanying consolidated financial statements&#160;include the financial position
 results of operations and cash flows of HOJ and its predecessor entities
 HOJ LLC and HOJ JV
 prior to the date of Acquisition. The historical results of operations and cash flows of AMHC and the Subsidiaries prior to the date of the Acquisition have been excluded from the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

On September 27
 2012 JW Roth submitted his resignation as a director and Chairman of the Company. The Company believes Mr. Roth tendered his resignation because management had placed different priorities for payables made by the Company and Mr. Roth did not agree with those priorities. Further
 Mr. Roth was in favor of hiring a candidate as Chief Executive Officer that the remaining Board members did not support.&#160;&#160;Michael Jaynes was appointed as Chairman of the Company to replace Mr. Roth.
















On November 12
 2012 the Company appointed Michael Jaynes as acting principal financial officer.&#160;&#160;Mr. Jaynes will serve in this capacity until a successor can be found and replaces AMHC Managed Services
 Inc. which was providing accounting and financial management services pursuant to the Management Agreement.&#160;&#160;


In March 2013
 Eric Skae was appointed Interim Chief Operating Officer.





The Company&#8217;s operations have generally grown as the Company has expanded its marketing efforts.&#160;&#160;Although the Company&#8217;s increased operations have resulted in greater net sales for the Company
 the Company&#8217;s costs of goods sold and operating costs have also increased.&#160;&#160;


Year Ended December 31
 2012 and December 31
 2011


For the year ended December 31
 2012
 we experienced a consolidated net loss of $2
145
000 or $.03 per common share compared to a consolidated net loss of $257
000 or less than $.01 per common share during the comparable period last year.&#160;&#160;Net sales and gross profits increased $799
000 or 285% and $177
000 or 125%
 respectively from the comparable period last year.&#160;&#160;These increases were offset by a $2
064
000 increase in operating expenses from the comparable period last year.





During the year ended December 31
 2012
 the Company generated approximately $1
079
000 in net sales compared to $280
000 in net sales in the comparable period last year.&#160;&#160;The $799
000 or 285% increase from the comparable period last year was primarily due to higher sales volume from new distribution partners in the United States
 Canada
 and Australia added during 2012.&#160;&#160;Approximately $270
000 of this increase was due to initial sales order from our distribution partners in Canada and Australia during the third and fourth quarters of 2012
 respectively.





Cost of goods sold
 which includes product costs
 packaging materials
 and product royalties
 increased $623
000 or 449% to $761
000 for the year ended December 31
 2012 as compared to $139
000 for the same period last year primarily due to higher sales volume described above.&#160;&#160;In addition
 higher product royalty costs associated with the Warner Brothers license signed in July 2011 resulted in full year of royalty costs in 2012 as compared to approximately two months of royalty costs during 2011. Cost of goods sold was also higher in 2012 due to the write-off of approximately $75
000 of packaging materials due to a change in images under the Warner Brothers license.&#160;&#160;The Company anticipates that cost of goods sold will decline in 2013 due to reduction in the Warner Brother royalty rate and increased operational efficiencies associated with change in co-packers in March 2013.




During the year ended December 31
 2012
 the Company realized a gross profit of $318
000 or 29% of net sales compared to $141
000 or 50% of net sales during the same period last year.&#160;&#160;The lower gross profit and corresponding gross margin during 2012 was due to several factors including i) a higher product royalty costs associated with the Warner Brothers license which was signed in July 2011 ii) write-off of packaging materials of approximately $75
000 in 2012 and iii) generally lower average sales prices realized on sales to distributors and international partners.&#160;&#160;The Company anticipates that gross profit and corresponding gross margins will improve in 2013 due to anticipated reduction in product royalties and improved efficiencies at a new co-packer facility.





Sales &amp; marketing costs increased $640
000 or 319% to $841
000 for the year ended December 31
 2012 as compared to $200
000 for the comparable period last year. This increase was primarily due to expanded marketing efforts to attract distribution partners in the United States
 Canada
 New Zealand &amp; Australia.&#160;&#160;During 2012
 the Company increased its product advertising and provided more sample product to prospective customers.&#160;&#160;The Company also hired several new sales brokers and brand manager consultants to increase its market presence.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 the Company experienced higher sales related consulting
 travel
 and trade show costs in 2012.



















General and administrative expenses increased $579
000 or 302% to $771
000 for the year ended December 31
 2012 as compared to $192
000 for the same period last year.&#160;&#160;This increase was primarily due to higher legal and accounting costs associated with the merger and reorganization with Accredited Members Holding Corporation completed in July 2012.&#160;&#160;In addition
 the Company experienced higher overall costs associated with operating a public company as compared to a private company in 2011.





This expense is solely attributable to the monthly management fee of $27
500 paid to AMHS Managed Services from March 1
 2012 to September 30
 2012.&#160;&#160;The managed services agreement was terminated effective October 1
 2012.





For the year ended December 31
 2012
 the Company recorded accrued settlement cost for the estimated fair value of 4
500
000 shares issued to AMHC Managed Services
 it two principals and an independent third party in settlement of certain claims associated with the managed service agreement and other matters.&#160;&#160;On January 14
 2013
 the Company issued 4
500
000 shares to the respective parties in settlement of these claims.





Interest expenses increased $1
000 to $7
000 for the year ended December 31
 2012 as compared to $6
000 for the same period last year.&#160;&#160;This increase was primarily due to higher overall average borrowings under the purchase order financing and factoring arrangements during 2012 as compared to 2011.





The Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31
 2012
 have been prepared on a going concern basis
 which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.&#160;&#160;The Report of our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statement as of and for the year ended December 31
 2012
 includes a &#8220;going concern&#8221; explanatory paragraph which means that the auditors stated that conditions exist that raise doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern.




During the year ended December 31
 2012
 we primarily used proceeds from the sale of common stock through private placements of approximately $727
000 and borrowings under purchase order financing and factor arrangements to fund our operations whereas during the comparable period in 2011
 we used advances received from related parties of approximately $83
000 and approximately $23
000 of borrowings under inventory financing arrangements to fund our operations.&#160;&#160;As described above
 the company significantly increased its sales and marketing costs during 2012 to expand its distribution network in the United States
 Canada
 New Zealand and Australia.&#160;&#160;Cash as of December 31
 2012 was approximately $9
000 as compared to $53
000 at December 31
 2011.


Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31
 2012 was $815
000 as compared to $43
000 for the comparable period last year. This increase in cash used in operations was primarily due to higher sales &amp; marketing and general &amp; administrative expenses during 2012 as compared to the same period last year.&#160;&#160;The negative cash flows from these higher expenses were partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.


Cash flows provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31
 2012 was $8
000 compared to no cash flows for the comparable period last year.&#160;&#160;The increase during 2012 was primarily due to $10
000 proceeds received from the sale of subsidiary interests in July 2012.


Cash flow provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31
 2012 was $764
000 compared to $96
000 for the comparable period last year.&#160;&#160;During 2012
 the Company closed three private placement offerings of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $727
000.&#160;&#160;In addition
 the Company had net borrowings under inventory financing payables of approximately $74
000 during 2012 as compared to $24
000 during 2011. These proceeds during 2012 were partially offset by cash outflows to repay advances made by related party of approximately $27
000.&#160;&#160;During 2011
 the Company received $83
000 in advances received from related parties.&#160;&#160;&#160;


















As of December 31
 2012
 we had cash and cash on hand of approximately $9
000 and a working capital deficit of $1
407
000 as compared to cash and cash on hand of $53
000 and working capital deficit of $150
000 as of December 31
 2011. The decrease in our liquidity and working capital were primarily the result of an increase in accounts payable associated with higher spending in the quarter ended December 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;In addition
 the Company recorded accrued settlement costs of $652
000 and accrued consulting costs of $225
000 during 2012.&#160;&#160;Both of these accrued liabilities were settled through an issuance of common stock in January 2013.


In September 2012
 the Company entered into a factoring agreement with a finance company which provided financing up to $250
000
 secured by the accounts receivable and inventory of the Company. The finance company advanced the Company up to 80% of eligible accounts receivable and was entitled to collect receivables directly from the Company&#8217;s customers.&#160;&#160;In November 2012
 the Company entered into a purchase order financing arrangement with this same finance company whereby the finance company advanced up to 100% of the manufacturing and shipping costs at the time a Company purchase order was submitted to the manufacturer. As of December 31
 2012
 the Company had borrowed approximately $98
000 under these financing arrangements.&#160;&#160;Amounts outstanding under these agreements were paid in full in January 2013 when the Company entered into the revolving credit facility described below.


On January 10
 2013
 the Company entered into a senior secured lending arrangement with TCA Global Credit Master Fund LP (&#8220;TCA&#8221;) for up to a maximum borrowing of $6
000
000. The credit facility provided for an initial line of credit of $425
000 and is to be used only as permitted under the specified use of proceeds. The line of credit has a six month term from the date of closing with a six month renewal option. The lending arrangement is secured by all of the assets of the Company. At closing
 the Company was advanced $425
000 less fees and closing costs.&#160;&#160;The Company anticipates using this borrowing facility to help fund its operations in 2013.


In March/April 2013
 the Company&#8217; Board of Directors reduced the number of common shares reserved under the 2012 Stock Option Plan from 11
500
000 shares to 4
500
000 and reduced the number of common shares reserved under the 2009 Stock Option Plan from 7
000
000 shares to 650
000 shares thereby increasing the number of common shares available for issuance by 10
350
000.


In April 2013
 the Board of Directors approved the authorization of 5
000
000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Series C Preferred Stock&#8221;). The Series C Preferred shares have voting rights equal to three votes per share and contain an automatic conversion into 15
000
000 common shares immediately upon the Company obtaining shareholder approval of
 and filing with the Colorado Secretary of State
 an increase in authorized common stock to at least 200
000
000 shares.


On April 12
 2013
 the Company executed a term sheet with an accredited investor (&#8220;Investor&#8221;) for a proposed investment of $1
000
000 in the Company in exchange for 15
000
000 shares of common stock
 5
000
000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock
 and warrants to acquire 500
000 shares of common stock at $0.12 per share for a period of five years. The warrants may be redeemed by the Company if certain conditions are met
 including that the shares underlying the warrants have been registered and the common stock trades at or above $.20 per share for 20 trading days. The first tranche of $500
000 is to be deposited on or before April 17
 2013 in exchange for 15
000
000 shares of common stock and warrants to acquire 250
000 common shares described above. The second tranche of $500
000 is to be deposited on or before April 26
 2013 in exchange for 5
000
000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock and warrants to acquire 250
000 common shares described above.&#160;On April 12
 2013
 the Company received $50
000 toward the first investment tranche.


Although the Company has generated revenue through the sale of its products
 the Company&#8217;s cash flow has not been sufficient to cover its operating expenses and the Company has had to rely upon proceeds from the sale of common stock through private placements to fund its operations.&#160;&#160;During the year ended December 31
 2012
 the Company received gross proceeds of $727
000 from the sale of common stock through private placements.&#160;&#160;&#160;We anticipate that we will continue to rely on sales of our securities in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete any additional sales of our equity securities or that we will be able arrange for other financing to fund our planned business activities. If we are unable to fund future operations by way of financing
 including public or private offerings of equity or debt securities
 our business
 financial condition and operating activities will be adversely impacted.





We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition
 changes in financial condition
 net sales or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our shareholders.



















In May 2011
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2011-04
 &#8220;Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS.&#8221; This pronouncement was issued to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (&#8220;IFRS&#8221;).&#160;&#160;ASU 2011-04 changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2011-04 became effective for the Company on January 1
 2012. The adoption of ASU 2011-04 did not have any impact on the Company&#8217;s financial position
 results of operations or liquidity.







Our management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. As the number of variables and assumptions affecting the future resolution of the uncertainties increase
 these judgments become even more subjective and complex. Although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable
 actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in estimates and assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results of operation and/or financial condition.







The Company is subject to credit risk through trade receivables. This credit risk is mitigated by the diversification of the Company&#8217;s operations
 as well as its customer base. The Company grants varying payment terms to its customers. Payment terms for customers can vary from due upon receipts up to net 45 days.

Two customers comprise approximately 78% of trade accounts receivable at December 31
 2012; these individual customer balances represent approximately 65% and 13% of the total trade accounts receivable.&#160; Three customers comprise approximately 76% of the trade accounts receivable at December 31
 2011; these individual customer balances represent approximately 50%
 15%
 and 11% of the total trade accounts receivable. Four customers accounted for 54% of net sales for the year ended December 31
 2012; these individual customer sales represent approximately 18%
 16%
 10%
 and 10% of annual net sales.&#160;&#160;Three customers accounted for 36% of net sales for the year ended December 31
 2011; these individual customer sales represent approximately 14%
 12%
 and 10% of annual net sales.&#160;&#160;During 2012
 sales to distribution partners in Canada and Australia accounted for approximately 16% and 10% of annual net sales.


Ongoing credit evaluations of customers&#8217; financial condition are performed. Collateral is not required. The Company maintains an allowance when necessary for doubtful accounts that is the Company&#8217;s best estimate of potentially uncollectible trade receivables. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices that are considered potentially uncollectible in whole or in part. For those invoices not specifically reviewed or considered uncollectible
 general provisions are provided at different rates
 based upon the age of the receivable
 historical experience
 and other currently available evidence. The allowance estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or as payments are made. As of December 31
 2012 and December 31
 2011
 the allowance for doubtful accounts was $21
624
 and $0
 respectively.





The Company has a license with Warner Bros. Consumer Products
 Inc. (&#8220;WBCP&#8221;) that allows the Company the use of the costumes
 artwork
 logos and other elements depicted in the 2009 movie
and the 2011 movie
.&#160;&#160;This license
 as amended
 expires January 31
 2016.&#160;&#160;The terms of the WBCP license provide for royalties based on a percentage of products sold
 as defined
 subject to agreed-upon guaranteed minimum royalties. Guaranteed minimum royalty payments are made periodically over the term of the license and are recorded when paid as a prepaid expense in the balance sheet.&#160;&#160;The prepaid expense is amortized to royalties in cost of goods sold at a ratio of current period revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the term of the license.&#160;&#160;The Company reviews its sales projections quarterly to determine the likely recoverability of its prepaid asset
 as well as any unpaid minimum obligation.&#160;&#160;If management determines that the prepaid expense is unlikely to be recovered by product sales
 prepaid license expense is charged to cost of goods sold
 based on current and expected revenues
 in the period in which such determination is made.&#160;&#160;



















The Company has contractual agreements with certain third-party distributors.&#160;&#160;Under the agreements
 the Company is not guaranteed any minimum level of sales or transactions.&#160;&#160;The Company also offers its products for sale through its website at 


The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following have occurred: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery to third party distributors and consumers via the Company&#8217;s website has occurred; (3) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.&#160;&#160;Delivery is not considered to have occurred until the title and the risk of loss passes to the customer according to the terms of the contract between the Company and the customer.&#160;&#160;For sales to distributors
 revenue is usually recognized at the time of delivery.&#160;&#160;For sales through the Company&#8217;s website
 revenue is recognized at the time of shipment.


 with regards to its determination of gross versus net reporting of revenue for transactions with customers.&#160;&#160;The Company sells
 through its website
 Hangover Joe&#8217;s Recovery Shots.&#160;&#160;In these transactions
 management has determined that the Company (i) acts as principal; (ii) has the risks and rewards of ownership
 including the risk of loss for collection
 delivery or returns; and (iii) has latitude in establishing price with the customer.&#160;&#160;For these transactions
 the Company recognizes revenue on a gross basis.


The Company offers a variety of incentives and discounts to distributors

 price allowances
 volume based rebates and product placement fees.&#160;&#160;These incentives and discounts are reflected as a reduction of gross sales to arrive at net sales. The aggregate deductions from gross sales recorded in relation to these programs were approximately $43
100 and $17
800 for the years ended December 31

 respectively





Cost of goods sold consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the production of its product
 co-packing fees
 and in-bound freight charges. Raw material costs account for the largest portion of the cost of goods sold. Raw materials include bottles
 ingredients and packaging materials. The manufacturer is responsible for the ingredients. Costs of goods sold also include license and royalty expenses.





The Company relies on its third-party suppliers for raw materials necessary for its products
 and it relies on third-party manufacturers for the production of its product.&#160;&#160;Although the Company believes that it could utilize alternative suppliers and manufacturers
 any delay in locating and establishing relationships with other suppliers/manufacturers could result in product shortages and back orders for the products
 with a resulting loss of net sales and profitability.&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s third-party manufacturer acquires some ingredients from suppliers outside of the United States.&#160;&#160;Purchasing these ingredients is subject to the risks generally associated with importing raw materials from other countries
 including
 among other factors
 delays in shipments
 changes in economic and political conditions
 quality assurance
 tariffs
 trade disputes and foreign currency fluctuations.&#160;&#160;These factors could result in a delay in or disruption of the supply of certain raw materials.&#160;&#160;Any significant delay in or disruption of the supply of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business.





Sales and marketing costs include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture
 as well as expenses for advertising
 sampling and in-store demonstration costs
 costs for merchandise displays
 point-of-sale materials
 trade shows
 other marketing expenses and product design expenses.





Freight-out costs incurred to ship product to customers and are included in sales &amp; marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Total freight-out costs were approximately $47
000 and $30
000 for the year ended December 31
 2012 and 2011
 respectively.



















The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under ASC 718
.&#160;&#160;ASC 718 requires the recognition of the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments in the financial statements and is measured based on the grant date fair value of the award.&#160;&#160;ASC 718 also requires the stock-based compensation expense to be recognized over the period of service in exchange for the award (generally the vesting period).&#160;&#160;The Company estimates the fair value of each stock option at the grant date by using an option pricing model
 typically the Black-Scholes model.






















As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;1934 Act&#8221;)
 as of December 31
 2012
 we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.&#160;&#160;This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.&#160;Based upon that evaluation
 our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting
 described below
 that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting such that there is not a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s rules and forms.&#160;&#160;Disclosure controls and procedures include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management
 including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer
 as appropriate
 to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.














pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;












provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and












provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of the Company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


















As of December 31
 2012
 management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) based on the criteria for effective ICFR established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments by smaller reporting companies and non-accelerated filers.

Based on that assessment
 management concluded that
 during the period covered by this report
 such internal controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31
 2012 and that material weaknesses in ICFR existed as more fully described below

As defined by Auditing Standard No. 5
 &#8220;An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that is Integrated with an Audit of Financial Statements and Related Independence Rule and Conforming Amendments
&#8221; established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)
 a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. In connection with the assessment described above
 management identified the following control deficiencies that represent material weaknesses as of December 31
 2012:








Lack of an independent audit committee or audit committee financial expert
 and no independent directors.&#160; We have not identified an audit committee financial expert on our board of directors
 and at the present time we have no independent directors.&#160; These factors are counter to corporate governance practices as defined by the various stock exchanges and may lead to less supervision over management.











Limited staffing within our accounting operations. The Company has utilized a limited number of consultants to provide bookkeeping and accounting functions during 2012. The relatively small number of personnel who are responsible for accounting functions prevents us from fully segregating duties within our internal control system. The inadequate segregation of duties is a weakness because it could lead to the untimely identification and resolution of accounting and disclosure matters or could lead to a failure to perform timely and effective reviews which may result in a failure to detect errors in spreadsheets
 calculations
 or assumptions used to prepare the financial statements and related disclosures as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additionally
 we did not maintain a sufficient number of financial and accounting staff with the appropriate level of knowledge and experience throughout 2012 to ensure that accurate and reliable financial statements of the Company are prepared and reviewed timely in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.







Due to a lack of personnel resources
 our ability to take any significant or immediate action to remediate these material weaknesses is limited.&#160;&#160;However
 we expect to implement further controls as circumstances and working capital permit.&#160;&#160;Notwithstanding the assessment that our ICFR was not effective and that there were material weaknesses as identified in this report
 we believe that our financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31
 2012
 fairly present our financial position
 results of operations and cash flows for the years covered thereby in all material respects.

We are committed to improving our financial organization. As part of this commitment
 we will (when funds and/or additional resources are available to the Company) consider taking the following actions: (1) appoint outside directors to our Board of Directors and utilize an independent audit committee of the Board of Directors who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources; and (3) hire independent third parties to provide expert advice.&#160;&#160;We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements
 as necessary and as funds allow.

The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors seeks to ensure that it is composed of members whose particular experience
 qualifications
 attributes
 and skills
 when taken together
 will allow the Board of Directors to satisfy its oversight obligations effectively.&#160;&#160;Currently
 the Company does not have a separate nominating committee as
 to date
 it does not believe that the Company as an early stage company with limited personnel
 required such a committee.&#160;&#160;However
 as the Company grows
 the Board may consider establishing a separate nominating committee.&#160;&#160;As such
 currently the Board of Directors as a whole is in charge of identifying and appointing appropriate persons to add to the Board of Directors when necessary.



The Company believes that the persons that currently comprise its Board of Directors have the experience
 qualifications and attributes and skills taken as a whole to enable the Board of Directors to satisfy its oversight responsibilities effectively.



During the past ten years
 none of the persons serving as executive officers and/or directors of the Company has been the subject matter of any of the following legal proceedings that are required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K including: (a)&#160;any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; (b)&#160;any criminal convictions; (c) any order
 judgment
 or decree permanently or temporarily enjoining
 barring
 suspending or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business
 securities or banking activities; (d)&#160;any finding by a court
 the SEC or the CFTC to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law
 any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies
 or any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud; or (e) any sanction or order of any self-regulatory organization or registered entity or equivalent exchange
 association or entity.&#160;&#160;Further
 no such legal proceedings are believed to be contemplated by governmental authorities against any director or executive officer.



Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act requires the Company&#8217;s directors and officers and any persons who own more than ten percent of the Company&#8217;s equity securities
 to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;).&#160;&#160;All directors
 officers and greater than ten-percent stockholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) reports files.&#160;&#160;Based solely on our review of the copies of Forms 3
 4 and any amendments thereto furnished to us during the fiscal year completed December 31
 2012
 and subsequently
 we believe that during the Company&#8217;s 2012 fiscal year all filing requirements applicable to our officers
 directors and greater-than-ten-percent stockholders were complied with.



The Company has not&#160;&#160;adopted a code of ethics because the board does not believe that
 given the small size of the Company its limited personnel
 and the limited number of transactions the Company has engaged in
 a code of ethics is warranted.



The Company does not have a separately designated audit committee.&#160;&#160;Instead
 the entire Board as a whole acts as the Company&#8217;s audit committee.&#160;&#160;Consequently the Company does not currently have a designated audit committee financial expert.



The Company does not have a separately designated nominating committee.&#160;&#160;The Company does not have such a committee because we currently believe that given our small size
 the fact that none of the members of our Board are not currently considered &#8220;independent&#8221;
 and because no Company securities are traded on a major stock exchange
 that such a committee is not currently necessary.&#160;&#160;Unless and until the Company establishes a separate nominating committee
 when a board vacancy occurs
 the remaining board members will participate in deliberations concerning director nominees.&#160;&#160;In the future the Company may determine that it is appropriate to designate a separate nominating committee of the board of directors comprised solely of independent directors.
















To date
 the Board of Directors has not adopted a formal procedure by which shareholders may recommend nominees to the board of directors.&#160;&#160;&#160;In considering candidates for membership on the Board of Directors
 the Board of Directors will take into consideration the needs of the Company and its Board of Directors and the qualifications of the candidate.&#160;&#160;With respect to potential new Board members the Board will require and/or review information such as the following:























A description of any relationship that could affect such person's qualifying as an independent director
 including identifying all other public company board and committee memberships;













Any information about the proposed candidate that would
 under the federal proxy rules
 be required to be included in the Company's proxy statement if such person were a nominee.

 2012 and 2011 in respect to each of the individuals who served as the Company&#8217;s chief executive officer at any time during the last fiscal year

129
528 shares of Company common stock with 3

764 shares vesting each on January 1
 2013 and January 1

 respectively. This warrant replaces a warrant issued by Hangover Joe&#8217;s Inc and later assumed by the Company in the AMHC Merger.&#160;&#160;Management has evaluated the performance criteria and has not recognized any stock based compensation in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;Pursuant to SEC instructions

 2010 through the Merger Date.









Mr. Lavigne was paid an annual base salary of $210
000 for 2011 and through the Merger Date in 2012.




The Board of Directors acting in lieu of a compensation committee
 is charged with reviewing and approving the terms and structure of the compensation of the Company&#8217;s executive officers.&#160;&#160;To date
 the Company has not retained an independent compensation consultant to assist the Company in reviewing and analyzing the structure and terms of the Company&#8217;s executive officers.&#160;&#160;Moreover
 throughout much of the Company&#8217;s fiscal year
 the same persons serving on the Board also served as Company executive officers.

The Company considers various factors when evaluating and determining the compensation terms and structure of its executive officers
 including the following:




















The Company&#8217;s financial resources
 results of operations
 and financial projections;










Performance compared to the financial
 operational and strategic goals established for the Company;










The nature
 scope and level of the executive&#8217;s responsibilities;










Competitive market compensation paid by other companies for similar positions
 experience and performance levels; and










The executive&#8217;s current salary
 the appropriate balance between incentives for long-term and short-term performance.





Company management is responsible for reviewing the base salary
 annual bonus and long-term compensation levels for other Company employees
 and the Company expects this practice to continue going forward.&#160;&#160;The entire Board of Directors remains responsible for significant changes to
 or adoption
 of new employee benefit plans.&#160;&#160;The Company believes that as relatively new company its compensation structure is fair to its executive officers as it is intended to balance the Company&#8217;s need to minimize its overhead costs yet reward its executives for individual performance and company performance.



The Company believes that the compensation environment for qualified professionals in the industry in which we operate is competitive.&#160;&#160;In order to compete in this environment
 the compensation of our executive officers is primarily comprised of the following components:











































































Base salary
 paid in cash
In determining base salaries for our key executive officers
 the Company aims to set base salaries at a level we believe enables us to hire and retain individuals in a competitive environment and to reward individual performance and contribution to our overall business goals. The Board of Directors believes that base salary should be relatively stable over time
 providing the executive a dependable
 minimum level of compensation
 which is approximately equivalent to compensation that may be paid by competitors for persons of similar abilities.&#160;&#160;&#160;The Board of Directors believes that base salaries for our executive officers are appropriate for persons serving as executive officers of public companies similar in size and complexity similar to the Company.







We have no set formula for granting awards to our executives or employees. In determining whether to grant awards and the amount of any awards
 we take into consideration discretionary factors such as the individual&#8217;s current and expected future performance
 level of responsibilities
 retention considerations
 and the total compensation package.&#160; The Company has granted certain of its executive officers (and other key employees) stock options.






We have no set bonus formula for determining or awarding discretionary cash bonuses to our other executives or employees. In determining whether to award bonuses and the amount of any bonuses
 we have taken and expect to continue to take into consideration discretionary factors such as the individual&#8217;s current and expected future performance
 level of responsibilities
 retention considerations
 and the total compensation package
 as well as the Company&#8217;s overall performance including cash flow and other operational factors.

During fiscal 2011
 we paid discretionary cash bonuses to certain of the Company&#8217;s executive officers (being Messrs. Roth and Lavigne).&#160;&#160;In general the bonuses paid to these executive officers were determined by the Board after considering the following factors: sales generated by each executive and improvements in Company operations oversaw by that executive.







In March 2012
 the Company entered into a representative agreement with Michael Malm who became executive officer and member of the Company&#8217;s board of directors in July 2012. Under this agreement
 as amended
 Mr. Malm is entitled to a commission of between 4% and 6% of sales made by Mr. Malm and certain sales brokers
 based on the nature of the sales
 and a royalty of 3% of all sales made by the Company
 as defined. Mr. Malm earned $16
601 and $13
963 in royalties and commissions respectively from the Merger Date through the end of December.&#160;&#160;As part of his agreement
 Mr. Malm received commission draws aggregating $33
000 from the Merger Date through the end of December.&#160;&#160;The commission draws have not been included as earned compensation.





Another element of the overall compensation is through providing our executive officers are various employment benefits
 such as the payment of a monthly allowance for health care insurance.

















Stock Option
 Stock Awards and Equity Incentive Plans

During 2012
 the Company did not grant any stock options or stock option awards to named executive officers under the 2009 or 2012 Stock Option Plan.&#160;&#160;However
 the Company did grant a warrant to purchase 6
129
528 shares of common stock to Mr. Malm outside the equity incentive plans during fiscal 2012.

The following table sets forth the outstanding equity awards for each named executive officer at December 31

764 shares vesting each on January 1
 2013 and January 1

 2013
 the board of directors concluded the sales target for 2012 was not met and warrants to purchase 3
064
764 shares of Company common stock were cancelled.



To date
 the Company has not provided any of the persons serving as on its directors any separate or additional consideration for serving on the Board.&#160;&#160;Therefore

 all compensation they received was provided in their capacity as executive officers.

The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors as a whole is charged with reviewing and approving all related party transactions. There have not been any transactions
 or proposed transactions
 to which the Company was or is to be a party
 in which any Company director
 officer
 or any member of the immediate family of the aforementioned persons had or is to have a direct or indirect material interest
 except those outlined below.&#160;&#160;On July 25
 2012 the Company completed a merger transaction whereby HOJ became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the &#8220;HOJ Merger&#8221;).&#160;&#160;The following disclosure is with respect to material transactions between the Company and related parties since July 25
 2012
 and with respect to material transactions between HOJ and related parties since its inception.








The Company&#8217;s President/CEO (former owner of HOJ LLC) has historically advanced funds to the Company and predecessor entities from time to time for working capital.&#160;&#160;As of December 31
 2012 and December 31
 2011
 advances payable to this party were $89
442 and $116
379
 respectively.&#160;&#160;These advances are non-interest bearing
 unsecured
 and due on demand.












In March 2012
 the Company entered into a representative agreement with Michael Malm who became a member of the Company&#8217;s board of directors in July 2012. Under this agreement
 as amended
 Mr. Malm is entitled to a commission of between 4% and 6% of sales made by Mr. Malm and certain sales brokers
 based on the nature of the sales
 and a royalty of 3% of all sales made by the Company

 2012 and 2011 totaled approximately $49
500 and $12
500
 respectively. Effective April 1
 2012
 the Company agreed to pay Mr. Malm a $6
000 draw per month against commissions.&#160;&#160;As of December 31

 net prepaid expenses related to draws in excess of commissions were approximately $28
200.












Effective March 1

 the Company entered into a management agreement (the &#8220;Management Agreement&#8221;) with AMHC Managed Services
 Inc. (&#8220;AMHC Services&#8221;)
 a subsidiary of AMHC to provide financial management and accounting services to HOJ. The Management Agreement term was 24 months
 and required the Company to pay AMHC Managed Services a monthly fee equal to $27
500 per month ($192

On January 14
 2013 the Company entered into a settlement agreement with AMHC Services
 the principal owners of AMHC Services
 and a separate shareholder pursuant to which the respective parties released each other from certain claims. Under the terms of the settlement the Company issued AMHC Services 3
000
000 shares of its common stock
 and issued the separate shareholder 1

 the Company recorded an accrued settlement liability of $652
500 on its consolidated balance sheet as of December 31
 2012 and has recorded a corresponding settlement cost on its consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31
 2012.












In March 2013
 the Company hired one of the principal owners of The Bricktown Group (&#8220;Bricktown&#8221;) to become the interim COO of the Company.&#160;&#160;In November 2012
 the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Bricktown to provide beverage management and strategic advisory consulting services to the Company.&#160;&#160;The consulting agreement has an initial term of six months with an automatic extension of 180 days provided neither party has provided a written notice to not extend the agreement.&#160;&#160;The contract can be terminated upon written notice at any time

 2012 until such shares are issued.&#160;&#160;The stock based compensation associated with the initial shares of $225
000 was recorded as prepaid consulting costs and is being amortized over the initial 3 months of this agreement. For the year ended December 31
 2012
 the Company recognized consulting expense of $81
383 related to this agreement. The measurement date for the second tranche of 1
500
000 shares is March 1
 2013.&#160;&#160;The fair value of these shares is determined based upon the closing market price of the Company&#8217;s common stock on this date and will be amortized over the remaining 3 months of the contract.&#160;&#160;On January 10
 2013 the Company issued the initial 1
500
000 shares of its common stock to Bricktown.

Statements of changes in deficit for the years ended December 31
 2012 and 2011















Statements of cash flows&#160;for the years ended December 31
 2012 and 2011


















































We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hangover Joe&#8217;s Holding Corporation and subsidiary (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December&#160;31
 2012 and 2011
 and the related consolidated statements of operations
 changes in equity
 and cash flows for the years ended December 31
 2012 and 2011. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management.&#160;Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion
 the consolidated financial statements referred&#160;to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of December&#160;31
 2012 and 2011
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements
 the Company reported a net loss of approximately $2
145
000 in 2012
 used net cash in operating activities of approximately $815
000 in 2012
 and has a working capital deficiency of approximately $1
407
000 at December 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern.&#160;&#160;Management&#8217;s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1.&#160;&#160;The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTE 1 &#8211; ORGANIZATION
 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 AND MANAGEMENT&#8217;S PLANS




Hangover Joe&#8217;s Holding Corporation (&#8220;HJHC&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was originally incorporated in the State of Colorado in December 2005 as Across American Real Estate Exchange
 Inc. (&#8220;AAEX&#8221;) to facilitate the exchange of real estate properties between individuals under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code.&#160;&#160;In February 2010
 Accredited Members
 Inc. (&#8220;AMI&#8221;)
 a provider of investor research and management services
 was merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAEX
 and AMI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.&#160;&#160;In May 2010
 AAEX changed its name to Accredited Members Holding Corporation (&#8220;AMHC&#8221;).



On July 25
 2012
 the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) with Hangover Joe&#8217;s
 Inc.
 a privately-held Colorado corporation (&#8220;HOJ&#8221;)
 whereby on July 25
 2012
 the Company acquired HOJ in a reverse triangular merger (the &#8220;Acquisition&#8221;).&#160;&#160;Prior to the Acquisition
 the Company had 36
807
801shares outstanding. Upon closing the Acquisition
 the Company issued 83
514
827 common shares to the HOJ shareholders in exchange for all of their ownership interests in HOJ such that the former owners of HOJ owned approximately 69% of the Company post Acquisition.&#160;&#160;The shareholders of the Company prior to the Acquisition owned approximately 31% of the Company post Acquisition.&#160;&#160;In connection with the Acquisition on July 25
 2012
 the Company changed its name to Hangover Joe&#8217;s Holding Corporation.


The Merger Agreement further provided that within five business days after the closing of the Acquisition
 the Company would sell to Accredited Members Acquisition Corporation (&#8220;Buyer&#8221;) all of the equity interests in three of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries (the &#8220;Sale&#8221;)
 being Accredited Members
 Inc.
 AMHC Managed Services
 Inc. and World Wide Premium Packers
 Inc. (collectively
 the &#8220;Subsidiaries&#8221;).&#160;&#160;Buyer is a privately-held Colorado corporation owned by two former directors of the Company
 JW Roth and David Lavigne.&#160;&#160;The parties closed the Sale on July 27
 2012.&#160;&#160;The Buyer paid $10
044 and assumed all liabilities related to the business of the Subsidiaries in exchange for all of the shares in the Subsidiaries owned by the Company.


HOJ is a Colorado corporation formed on March 5
 2012.&#160;&#160;HOJ was formed for the purpose of acquiring all of the assets of both Hangover Joe&#8217;s Products LLC (&#8220;HOJ LLC&#8221;) and Hangover Joe&#8217;s Joint Venture (&#8220;HOJ JV&#8221;).&#160;&#160;HOJ LLC had conducted operations through HOJ JV
 with the owner of HOJ LLC being one of the same owners and control persons of HOJ JV. Effective March 30
 2012
 HOJ acquired the net assets of HOJ LLC and HOJ JV through the issuance of common stock of HOJ.&#160;&#160;Because HOJ had no significant assets or business operations prior to the merger and each of these entities were owned by the same control group
 this transaction was accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 the historical results of operations of HOJ LLC and HOJ JV prior to March 30
 2012 are included in the results of operations of the Company.


Because all of the operating businesses of AMHC were contemporaneously sold within five business days after the Acquisition
 the transaction has been accounted for as a recapitalization of HOJ.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial position
 results of operations and cash flows of HOJ and its predecessor entities
 HOJ LLC and HOJ JV
 prior to the date of Acquisition. The historical results&#160;operations and cash flows of AMHC and the Subsidiaries prior to the date of the Acquisition have been excluded from the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The stockholders&#8217; equity of HOJ prior to the Acquisition has been retroactively restated for the equivalent number of shares received in the exchange after giving effect to any differences in the par value of the AMHC and HOJ common stock
 with an offset to additional paid-in capital.&#160;&#160;The restated consolidated accumulated deficit of the accounting acquirer (HOJ) has been carried forward after the exchange.





The Company sells an all-natural
 two-ounce beverage
 movie series from Warner Brothers.&#160;&#160;The Company has registered the trademark &#8220;Hangover Joe&#8217;s Get Up &amp; Go&#8221; with the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. The assets consist of intellectual property relating to Hangover Joe&#8217;s Recovery Shot
 including but not limited to a license agreement dated July 19
 2011
 between HOJ LLC and Warner Bros. Consumer Products
 Inc.&#160;&#160;The license agreement permits HOJ to use the costumes
 artwork logos
 and other elements depicted in the 2009 movie &#8220;The Hangover&#8221; during the term of the license agreement
 as amended
 which expires January 31
 2016.&#160;&#160;The Company sells its products primarily to convenience stores
 liquor stores
 and grocery stores through distribution agreements
seeking to expand the distribution of the Hangover Joe&#8217;s Recovery Shot
 and has recently entered into distribution agreements to expand its reach to Australia
















NOTE 1 &#8211; ORGANIZATION
 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 AND MANAGEMENT&#8217;S PLANS (CONTINUED)




The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company reported a net loss of approximately $2
145
000 for the year ended December 31
 2012
 and a working capital deficiency and accumulated deficit of approximately $1
407
000 and $2
464
000
 respectively
 at December 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;The Company has a limited operating history and has relied primarily on debt financing and private placements of its common stock to fund its operations.&#160;&#160;The Company cannot provide any assurance it will be able to raise funds through a future issuance of debt or equity to carry out its business plan. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets
 or the amounts or classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern. Management&#8217;s plans with regards to these conditions are described below.












In January 2013
 the Company entered into a senior secured lending arrangement with TCA Global Credit Master Fund LP (&#8220;TCA&#8221;) for up to a maximum borrowing of $6
000
000. The credit facility has an initial line of credit of $425
000 with a six month term (and six month renewal option) and is collateralized by the assets of the Company. At closing
 the Company was advanced $425
000
 less fees and closing costs.













On April 12
 2013
 the Company executed a term sheet with an accredited investor (&#8220;Investor&#8221;) for a proposed investment of $1
000
000 in the Company in exchange for 15
000
000 shares of common stock
 5
000
000 shares of newly authorized Series C Preferred Stock (convertible into 15
000
000 shares of common stock) and warrants to acquire 500
000 shares of common stock at $0.12 per share for a period of five years. The first tranche of $500
000 is to be deposited on or before April 17
 2013 in exchange for 15
000
000 shares of common stock and warrants to acquire 250
000 common shares described above. The second tranche of $500
000 is to be deposited on or before April 26
 2013 in exchange for 5
000
000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock and warrants to acquire 250
000 common shares described above (See Note 11). On April 12
 the Company received $50
000 toward the first investment tranche.












Management has also taken steps to reduce its operating costs. As part of this effort
 certain executive officers and consultants agreed to defer a portion of their compensation effective October 1
 2012.

















The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its 100%-owned subsidiary.&#160;&#160;All intercompany accounts
 transactions
 and profits are eliminated in consolidation.






Certain immaterial reclassifications have been made to the prior period consolidated financial statements in order to conform to the current year presentation.&#160;&#160;The Company has reclassified $86
000 in sample costs and $30
000 in shipping and handling costs from cost of goods sold to sales and marketing costs
 respectively for the fiscal year ended December 31
 2011. The Company has determined that the reclassification more accurately reflects the economics of these transactions.

























Significant estimates are used in accounting for certain items such as allowance for doubtful accounts
 revenue recognition
 and stock-based compensation. Estimates are based on historical experience
 where applicable
 and assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates
 actual results may differ.





The Company is subject to credit risk through trade receivables. This credit risk is mitigated by the diversification of the Company&#8217;s operations
 as well as its customer base. The Company grants varying payment terms to its customers. Payment terms for customers can vary from due upon receipt up to net 45 days.

Two customers comprise approximately 78% of trade accounts receivable at December 31
 2012; these individual customer balances represent approximately 65% and 13% of the net trade accounts receivable.&#160; Three customers comprise approximately 76% of the trade accounts receivable at December 31
 2011; these individual customer balances represent approximately 50%
 15%
 and 11% of the total trade accounts receivable. Four customers accounted for 54% of net sales for the year ended December 31
 2012; these individual customer sales represent approximately 18%
 16%
 10%
 and 10% of annual net sales.&#160;&#160;Three customers accounted for 36% of net sales for the year ended December 31
 2011; these individual customer sales represent approximately 14%
 12%
 and 10% of annual net sales.&#160;&#160;During 2012
 sales to distributors in Canada and Australia accounted for approximately 16% and 10% of annual net sales.


Ongoing credit evaluations of customers&#8217; financial condition are performed. Collateral is not required. The Company maintains an allowance when necessary for doubtful accounts that is the Company&#8217;s best estimate of potentially uncollectible trade receivables. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices that are considered potentially uncollectible in whole or in part. For those invoices not specifically reviewed or considered uncollectible
 general provisions are provided at different rates
 based upon the age of the receivable
 historical experience
 and other currently available evidence. The allowance estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or as payments are made. As of December 31
 2012
 the allowance for doubtful accounts was $21
624. There was no allowance at December 31
 2011.





Inventory is valued at the lower of cost (first-in
 first-out) or market value.





The Company has a license with Warner Bros. Consumer Products
 Inc. (&#8220;WBCP&#8221;) that allows the Company the use of the costumes
 artwork
 logos and other elements depicted in the 2009 movie
.&#160;&#160;This license
 as amended
 expires January 31
 2016.&#160;&#160;The terms of the WBCP license provide for royalties based on a percentage of products sold
 as defined
 subject to agreed-upon guaranteed minimum royalties. Guaranteed minimum royalty payments are made periodically over the term of the license and are recorded when paid as a prepaid expense in the balance sheet.&#160;&#160;The prepaid expense is amortized to royalties in cost of goods sold at a ratio of current period revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the term of the license.&#160;&#160;The Company reviews its sales projections quarterly to determine the likely recoverability of its prepaid asset
 as well as any unpaid minimum obligation.&#160;&#160;If management determines that the prepaid expense is unlikely to be recovered by product sales
 prepaid license expense is charged to cost of goods sold
 based on current and expected revenues
 in the period in which such determination is made.&#160;&#160;






















The Company has contractual agreements with certain third-party distributors.&#160;&#160;Under the agreements
 the Company is not guaranteed any minimum level of sales or transactions.&#160;&#160;The Company also offers its products for sale through its website at 


The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following have occurred: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery to third party distributors and consumers via the Company&#8217;s website has occurred; (3) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.&#160;&#160;Delivery is not considered to have occurred until the title and the risk of loss passes to the customer according to the terms of the contract between the Company and the customer.&#160;&#160;For sales to distributors
 revenue is usually recognized at the time of delivery.&#160;&#160;For sales through the Company&#8217;s website
 revenue is recognized at time of shipment.


 with regards to its determination of gross versus net reporting of revenue for transactions with customers.&#160;&#160;The Company sells
 through its website
 Hangover Joe&#8217;s Recovery Shots.&#160;&#160;In these transactions
 management has determined that the Company (i) acts as principal; (ii) has the risks and rewards of ownership
 including the risk of loss for collection
 delivery or returns; and (iii) has latitude in establishing price with the customer.&#160;&#160;For these transactions
 the Company recognizes revenue on a gross basis.


The Company offers a variety of incentives and discounts to distributors

 price allowances
 volume based rebates and product placement fees.&#160;&#160;These incentives and discounts are reflected as a reduction of gross sales to arrive at net sales. The aggregate deductions from gross sales recorded in relation to these programs were approximately $43
100 and $17
800 for the years ended December 31

 respectively





Cost of goods sold consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the production of its product
 co-packing fees
 and in-bound freight charges. Raw material costs account for the largest portion of the cost of goods sold. Raw materials include bottles
 ingredients and packaging materials. The manufacturer is responsible for the ingredients. Costs of goods sold also include license and royalty expenses.





The Company relies on its third-party suppliers for raw materials necessary for its products
 and it relies on third-party manufacturers for the production of its product.&#160;&#160;Although the Company believes that it could utilize alternative suppliers and manufacturers
 any delay in locating and establishing relationships with other suppliers/manufacturers could result in product shortages and back orders for the products
 with a resulting loss of net sales and profitability.&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s third-party manufacturer acquires some ingredients from suppliers outside of the United States.&#160;&#160;Purchasing these ingredients is subject to the risks generally associated with importing raw materials from other countries
 including
 among other factors
 delays in shipments
 changes in economic and political conditions
 quality assurance
 tariffs
 trade disputes and foreign currency fluctuations.&#160;&#160;These factors could result in a delay in or disruption of the supply of certain raw materials.&#160;&#160;Any significant delay in or disruption of the supply of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business.





Sales and marketing costs include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture
 as well as expenses for advertising
 sampling and in-store demonstration costs
 costs for merchandise displays
 point-of-sale materials
 trade shows
 other marketing expenses and product design expenses.



Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Total advertising expenses were approximately $122
000 and $27
000 for the years ended December 31
 2012 and 2011
 respectively.






















Freight-out costs incurred to ship product to customers are included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Total freight-out costs were approximately $47
000 and $30
000 for the years ended December 31
 2012 and 2011
 respectively.




Prior to March 2012
 no provision for income taxes was provided in the accompanying financial statements because HOJ LLC (as a limited liability company)
 and HOJ JV (as a partnership)
 elected to file as partnerships
 and therefore management believes that prior to March 31
 2012 the Company was not subject to income taxes
 and
 that such taxes were the responsibility of the individual member/partners.


Beginning in March 2012
 as a corporation
 the Company now records a provision for deferred income tax assets and liabilities in order to reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between (i) the tax basis of assets and liabilities and (ii) their reported amounts in the financial statements.&#160;&#160;The provision is based upon enacted tax laws and rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.&#160;&#160;The Company establishes a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.&#160;&#160;The Company expects to file income tax returns in the US Federal jurisdiction and various State jurisdictions.


The Company assesses the likelihood of the financial statement effect of a tax position that should be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority based on the technical merits of the tax position
 circumstances
 and information available as of the reporting date.&#160;&#160;All tax years remain open and subject to U.S. Federal tax examination.&#160;&#160;Management does not believe that there are any current tax positions that would result in an asset or liability for taxes being recognized in the accompanying financial statements.








Stock-Based Compensation is recognized for an award of equity instruments in the financial statements and is measured based on the grant date fair value of the award.&#160;&#160;Stock-Based Compensation expense is recognized over the period of service in exchange for the award (generally the vesting period).&#160;&#160;The Company estimates the fair value of each stock option at the grant date by using an option pricing model
 typically the Black-Scholes model.


For shares issued to non-employees for goods or services
 the Company accounts for these shares in accordance with ASC 505-50.&#160;&#160;Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable (a) goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued.&#160;&#160;The fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of the performance commitment date or performance completion date.





Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Historical loss per share of the accounting acquirer (HOJ) has been adjusted retroactively to reflect the new capital structure of the Company as a result of the Merger Agreement.&#160;&#160;Diluted net loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company
 unless the effect of such inclusion would reduce a loss or increase earnings per share. For each of the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
 the effect of the inclusion of dilutive shares would have resulted in a decrease in loss per share. Stock options
 warrants
 and common shares underlying convertible preferred stock in the aggregate of 10
355
726 and 3
638
070 shares as of December 31
 2012 and 2011
 respectively
 were not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per common share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.






















ASC 820 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
 where available.











































Under fair value accounting
 assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. As of December 31
 2012 and 2011
 the Company had no financial assets or liabilities required to be reported for fair value purposes.


The carrying value of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments
 including cash
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable
 and the inventory financing payable approximate fair value at December 31
 2012 and 2011
 due to the relatively short maturity of the respective instruments. The fair value of related party payables is not practicable to estimate due to the related party nature of the underlying transactions.




In May 2011
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2011-04
.&#8221; This pronouncement was issued to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (&#8220;IFRS&#8221;).&#160;&#160;ASU 2011-04 changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2011-04 became effective for the Company on January 1
 2012. The adoption of ASU 2011-04 did not have any impact on the Company&#8217;s financial position
 results of operations or liquidity.

In connection with the Warner Brothers license renewal in January 2013
 certain changes were made to images that were available to the Company under the original license agreement which required a re-design of certain packaging materials.&#160;&#160;The Company is able to use the existing packaging and promotional materials through March 31
 2013. Accordingly
 the Company evaluated the carrying value of the packing material on hand as of December 31
 2012 and recorded a write-down of inventory of $75
376 in the fourth quarter of 2012.&#160;&#160;The inventory write-down is included in costs of goods sold in the consolidated statement of operations for the year-end December 31
 2012.

 the Company recorded an accrued consulting cost liability of $225
000 on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31
 2012 until such shares are issued.&#160;&#160;The stock-based compensation associated with the initial shares of $225

383 related to this agreement. The measurement date for the second tranche of 1
500

 2013
 the Company issued the initial 1

Of the 10
000
000 shares of the Company&#8217;s authorized Preferred Stock
 ($0.10 par value per share)
 425
000 shares are designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Series A Preferred&#8221;).&#160;&#160;The holders of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred are entitled to notice of any shareholders&#8217; meeting and to vote as a single class with the common stock upon any matter submitted for approval by the holders of common stock
 on an as-converted basis
 as defined. Each share of Series A Preferred shall have eight votes per share. If any dividend or distribution is declared or paid by the Company on common stock
 whether payable in cash
 property
 securities or rights to acquire securities
 the holders of the Series A Preferred will be entitled to participate with the holders of common stock in such dividend or distribution
 as defined.



















Additionally
 upon liquidation
 dissolution or winding up on the Company
 the Series A Preferred shareholders are entitled to be paid together with the common shareholders on a pro-rata basis.&#160;&#160;The Series A Preferred holders may convert such shares of Series A Preferred in whole or in part
 at any time
 or from time-to-time upon written notice to the Company subject to the terms set forth below. The Series A Preferred may
 or shall
 be converted into shares of the Company&#8217;s authorized but unissued common stock on the following bases: (i) At the option of the holder
 at any time before the &#8220;Financial Milestone&#8221; is met each share of Series A Preferred shall be convertible into eight shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. (ii) Upon the &#8220;Financial Milestone&#8221; being met
 each share of Series A Preferred shall automatically be converted into 28.8 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. (iii) If the &#8220;Financial Milestone&#8221; has not been met by October 8
 2013
 each share of Series A Preferred then outstanding shall automatically be converted into eight shares of the Corporation&#8217;s Common Stock. Subsequent to the HOJ Merger on July 24
 2012 through December 31

 one Series A Preferred holder converted 1
667 Series A Preferred Shares into 13
336 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock.





The Company is authorized to issue up to 150

 the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with HOJ
 whereby the Company issued 83
514
827 common shares in exchange for all the outstanding shares of HOJ. This transaction has been accounted for as a recapitalization of HOJ and accordingly the historical stockholders&#8217; equity transactions of HOJ prior to the Acquisition has been retroactively restated for the equivalent number of shares received in the exchange after giving effect to any differences in the par value of the AMHC and HOJ common stock
 with an offset to additional paid-in capital.&#160;

In connection with the Acquisition
 an HOJ shareholder holding the equivalent of 612
953 shares of common stock asserted his rights as a dissenting shareholder under the Colorado Business Corporation Act and demanded payment for the fair value amount of his shares as of the date of the Acquisition.&#160;&#160;In July 2012

 the Company may grant non-statutory and incentive options to employees
 directors and consultants for up to a total of 7
000
000 shares of common stock. The exercise prices of the options granted are determined by the Plan Committee

 2012
 stock options to purchase 650
000 shares of common stock are outstanding under the 2009 Plan.

A summary of the weighted average assumptions used to value stock options for the year ended December 31
 2012 is as follows:













































During the year ended December 31
 2012
 the Company granted options to purchase an aggregate of 2
266
190 shares of common stock with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $0.055.&#160;&#160;Stock options to acquire 766
190 shares were granted to an employee for sales development and have an exercise price of $0.0326 per share and a term of three years.&#160;&#160;The options vest 383
095 each on April 5
 2013 and 2014 based upon the achievement of the performance objectives determined by management
 as defined.&#160;&#160;Management has evaluated the performance criteria as of December 31
 2012 and determined it is unlikely that the performance objective will be met for 2013 or 2014 and accordingly has not recognized any stock-based compensation during the year ended December 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;In December 2012
 the Company granted options to purchase 1
500
000 shares of common stock which vested immediately with a weighted average grant date fair value of $0.064. No options were exercised during the year ended December 31
 2012.


During the year ended December 31
 2011
 AMHC granted options to purchase an aggregate of 892
500 shares of common stock with a weighted average grant date fair value of $0.16.&#160;&#160;No options were exercised during the year ended December 31
 2011.

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total intrinsic value (the difference between the estimated fair value of the Company&#8217;s common stock on December 31
 2012
 and the exercise price
 multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had they exercised their options on December 31
 2012.


As a result of the reorganization described in Note 1
 the Company has not recognized any stock-based compensation cost previously recorded on the books of AMHC prior to the date of reorganization.&#160;&#160;During the year ended December 31
 2012
 the Company recognized $95
690 of stock-based compensation related to stock options issued in general and administrative expenses.&#160;&#160;No stock-based compensation was recognized in 2011. As of December 31
 2012
 the Company does not expect outstanding options to acquire 766
190 shares of common stock will vest due to the performance criteria outlined in the option agreement. Compensation cost is revised if subsequent information indicates that the actual number of options vested is likely to differ from previous estimates.

The following table summarizes the activity and value of non-vested options as of and for the years ended December 31
 2012 and 2011:

In April 2012
 the Company granted a warrant to a sales consultant and director of the Company to purchase up to 6
129
528 shares of common stock in connection with a two-year service agreement.&#160;&#160;This warrant has a three-year term and an exercise price of $0.0326 per share with 3
064
764 shares vesting each on January 1
 2013 and January 1
 2014 if the Company&#8217;s sales exceed certain thresholds in 2012 and 2013
 respectively.&#160;&#160;On January 1
 2013
 the board of directors concluded the sales target for 2012 was not met and warrants to purchase 3
064
764 shares of Company common stock were cancelled. Management has evaluated the performance criteria and currently does not anticipate that the sales thresholds for 2013 will be met and accordingly no stock-based compensation has been recognized during the year ended December 31
 2012. Compensation cost is revised if subsequent information indicates that the actual number of warrants vested is likely to differ from previous estimates.


In December 2012
 the Company granted a warrant to an investor relations firm to purchase up to 100
000 shares of common stock that vested immediately.&#160;&#160;This warrant has a three-year term and an exercise price of $0.11 per share
 and $17
549 of stock based compensation related to this warrant has been recognized in general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31
 2012.





Prior to March 31
 2012
 the Company&#8217;s owners/officers contributed management and administrative services to the Company.&#160;&#160;The fair value of those services has been recorded as an expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements based on the estimated fair value for such services
 with a corresponding credit to contributed capital.&#160;&#160;The fair value of the historical services was estimated based on the compensation per employment terms that were entered into in March 2012.&#160;&#160;Contributed services were $50
000 and $150
000 for the years ended December 31
 2012 and 2011
 respectively.







Through March 5
 2012 (the date of incorporation of HOJ)
 no provision for income taxes has been provided in the accompanying combined financial statements because HOJ LLC and HOJ JV elected to file as partnerships
 and therefore HOJ was not subject to income taxes
 and
 that such taxes are the responsibility of the individual member/partners.



















Beginning March 5
 2012
 HOJ began recording a provision for deferred income tax assets and liabilities in order to reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between (i) the tax basis of assets and liabilities and (ii) their reported amounts in the financial statements.&#160;&#160;The provision is based upon enacted tax laws and rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.


On July 25
 2012
 the Company acquired HOJ and began recording a provision for deferred income tax assets and liabilities. As of December 31
 2012
 the Company&#8217;s net deferred tax assets have been fully reserved
 effectively by a valuation allowance
 because management does not believe realization of the deferred tax assets is sufficiently assured at the balance sheet date.


No income tax benefit was recognized for the year ended December 31
 2012 as indicated below:

At December 31
 2012 the Company has U.S. net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $1.0 million which expire in the years 2029 through 2032.


















The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $745
000 at December 31
 2012 relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets
 primarily net operating loss carry forwards in various tax jurisdictions. The Company continually assesses both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets can be realized prior to their expiration. Based on the Company&#8217;s assessment
 it has determined the deferred tax assets are not currently realizable.





The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains provisions that limit the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards if there has been a change in ownership as described in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result of the Acquisition in July 2012
 substantial changes in the Company&#8217;s ownership have occurred that may limit or reduce the amount of net operating loss carry-forward that the Company could utilize in the future to offset taxable income. The Company has not completed a detailed Section 382 study to determine what impact
 if any
 that ownership changes may have had on the Company&#8217;s net operating loss carry-forwards.





During the years ended December 31
 2012 and 2011
 the Company has not identified any unrecognized tax benefits or had any additions or reductions in tax positions and therefore a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is not presented. The Company does not have any unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31
 2012 and accordingly the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate will not be materially affected by unrecognized tax benefits.












On January 10
 2013
 the Company entered into a senior secured lending arrangement with TCA Global Credit Master Fund LP (&#8220;TCA&#8221;) for up to a maximum borrowing of $6
000
000. The credit facility provides for an initial line of credit of $425
000 based upon accounts receivables and projected sales and is to be used only as permitted under the specified use of proceeds for working capital purposes. The line of credit has a six month term from the date of closing with a six month renewal option. The lending arrangement is secured by all of the assets of the Company. As a partial guaranty under the TCA lending arrangement
 the Company&#8217;s CEO executed a validity guaranty thereby personally guaranteeing certain representations made by the Company to TCA.&#160;&#160;At closing
 the Company was advanced $425
000 less fees and closing costs.


In connection with the agreement above
 TCA was issued an investment banking fee consisting of 125
authorized Series B Preferred Shares in the Company equating to an aggregate of $125
000 in the Company&#8217;s capital stock. The shares are convertible into the Company&#8217;s common shares after July 1
 2013.&#160;&#160;Also in connection with the TCA agreement
 the Company issued 194
954 shares of common stock to Meyers Associates LP as consideration for a finder&#8217;s fee for this transaction.





In January 2013
 a shareholder of the Company surrendered 4
500
000 shares of common stock to the Company&#8217;s treasury for no consideration.&#160;&#160;The shares were initially issued to a founder in March 2012 and were returned to increase the number of common shares available.





On February 15
 2013
 the Company entered into an investor relations agreement with a firm which requires the Company to pay a consulting fee of $2
500 per month and to provide 100
000 shares of the Company common stock per month and warrants to purchase 100
000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock per month.






















Effective March 1
 2013
 the Board of Directors appointed Eric Skae to serve as interim Chief Operating Officer (&#8220;COO&#8221;). Mr. Skae will be paid an annual salary of $100
000 in the same manner as other officers of the Company.





In April 2013
 the Board of Directors approved the authorization of 5
000
000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Series C Preferred Stock&#8221;). The Series C Preferred shares have voting rights equal to three votes per share and contain an automatic conversion into 15
000
000 common shares immediately upon the Company obtaining shareholder approval of
 and filing with the Colorado Secretary of State
 an increase in authorized common stock to at least 200
000
000 shares.





On April 12
 2013
 the Company executed a term sheet with an accredited investor (&#8220;Investor&#8221;) for a proposed investment of $1
000
000 in the Company in exchange for 15
000
000 shares of common stock
 5
000
000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock
 and warrants to acquire 500
000 shares of common stock at $0.12 per share for a period of five years. The first tranche of $500
000 is to be deposited on or before April 17
 2012 in exchange for 15
000
000 shares of common stock and warrants to acquire 250
000 common shares described above. The second tranche of $500
000 is to be deposited on or before April 26
 2013 in exchange for 5
000
000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock and warrants to acquire 250
000 common shares described above. On April 12
 2013
 the Company received $50
000 toward the first investment tranche.


The common shares and underlying common shares attributable to the Series C Preferred Stock and warrants will have piggyback registration rights that will be triggered if the Company files a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the resale of other securities. The warrants may be redeemed by the Company if certain conditions are met
 including that the shares underlying the warrants have been registered and the common stock trades at or above $.20 per share for 20 trading days. The Investor will be entitled to one seat on the Company's Board of Directors
 and certain other development and distribution rights
 as defined.

HANGOVER JOE&#8217;S HOLDING CORPORATION (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;)
 a corporation organized and existing under the Colorado Business Corporation Act (the &#8220;CBCA&#8221;)
 hereby certifies that
 pursuant to the authority conferred upon the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) by its Articles of Incorporation and pursuant to the provisions of the CBCA
 on January 9
 2013
 the Board duly adopted the following resolution providing for the authorization of 125
000 shares of the Corporation's Series B Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Series B Preferred Stock&#8221;):


RESOLVED
 that pursuant to the authority vested in the Board by the Corporation&#8217;s Articles of Incorporation
 the Board hereby establishes from the Corporation&#8217;s authorized class of preferred stock a new series to be known as &#8220;Series B Preferred Stock
&#8221; consisting of 125
shares
 and hereby determines the designation
 preferences
 rights
 qualifications
 limitations and privileges of the Series B Preferred Stock of the Corporation to be as follows:

.&#160;&#160;Of the 10
000
000 shares of the Company&#8217;s authorized Preferred Stock
 $0.10 par value per share
 125
000 are designated as &#8220;Series B Preferred Stock
&#8221; with the rights and preferences set forth below. Only one person or entity is entitled to be designated as the owner of all of the Series B Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Holder&#8221;)
 in whose name the initial certificates representing the Series B Preferred Stock shall be issued. Any transfer of the Series B Preferred Stock to a different Holder must be approved in advance by the Corporation; provided
 however
 the Holder shall have the right to transfer the Series B Preferred Stock
 or any portion thereof
 to any affiliate of Holder or nominee of Holder
 without the approval of the Corporation.







pon any liquidation
 dissolution or winding up of the Corporation
 the Holder of outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to be paid the &#8220;Liquidation Preference
&#8221; which is defined and calculated as follows: $125
000 in the aggregate (not on a per share basis)
 less any and all gross proceeds in cash from the sale or other conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock and/or common stock into which shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall have been converted
 and less any payments in redemption of shares of Series B Preferred Stock. Holder of Series B Preferred Stock shall promptly provide to the Corporation all documents necessary for the adjustments in the Liquidation Preference due to the sale or disposition of any Series B Preferred Stock or common stock into which the Series B Preferred Stock was converted. Once the Liquidation Preference is calculated as zero
 the Holder shall not be entitled to any further proceeds remaining from the liquidation of the Corporation
 any remaining shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall automatically be cancelled
 and Holder shall surrender to the Corporation any certificates evidencing remaining shares of Series B Preferred Stock for cancellation.&#160;&#160;Further
 once the Liquidation Preference equals zero
 then all remaining shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall automatically be cancelled.&#160;&#160;At any time after January __
 2014
 if the Liquidation Preference is greater than zero
 then Holder has the right to put any remaining shares of Series B Preferred Stock back to the Corporation in complete redemption at a price equal to the Liquidation Preference; provided
 however
 that this mandatory redemption provision shall only be applicable if the Corporation is permitted at the time of the redemption to redeem such shares under the CBCA. 
























The Holder may convert such shares of Series B Preferred Stock in whole or in part
 at any time after July __
 2013
 or from time-to-time thereafter upon written notice to the Corporation subject to the terms set forth below. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock may
 or shall
prior to the date a &#8220;Conversion Notice&#8221; (as hereinafter defined) is provided to the Corporation
 as reported by Bloo











No fractional shares of common stock shall be issued upon the conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock.&#160;&#160;If the number of shares to be issued to the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock is not a whole number
 then the number of the shares shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number.











In the case of a conversion
 before Holder shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock
 it shall provide a conversion notice (the &#8220;Conversion Notice&#8221;)
 which Conversion Notice shall specify the VWAP as of the conversion date
 the number of Conversion Shares to be issued in connection with such conversion
 and the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. The calculations and entries set forth in the Conversion Notice shall control in the absence of manifest or mathematical error. To effect conversions of Series B Preferred Stock
 the Holder shall not be required to surrender the certificate(s) representing the Series B Preferred Stock to the Corporation unless all of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock represented thereby are so converted
 in which case such Holder shall surrender to the Corporation or its transfer agent
 the certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be converted
 or if the Holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificate or certificates have been lost
 stolen or destroyed
 upon the execution and delivery of an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any losses incurred by it in connection therewith. Partial conversions hereunder where the certificate(s) representing the shares of Series B Preferred Stock are not surrendered shall have the effect of reducing the number of shares represented by such certificate(s) by the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock converted in each applicable conversion
 as set forth in each Conversion Notice.&#160;&#160;The Holder and the Corporation shall maintain records showing the amount of shares of Series B Preferred Stock converted upon each conversion
 and the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock remaining to be converted. The Corporation shall
 as soon as practicable after receipt of a Conversion Notice
&#8221;)
 issue and deliver at such office to the Holder
 or to the nominee or nominees of such Holder
 as set forth in the Conversion Notice
 a certificate or certificates representing the Conversion Shares to which such Holder shall be entitled as aforesaid.


























. If in the case of any Conversion Notice
 the certificate or certificates representing the Conversion Shares issuable upon such conversion are not delivered to or as directed by the Holder by the Share Delivery Date
 the Holder shall be entitled to elect by written notice to the Corporation at any time on or before its receipt of such certificate or certificates
 to rescind such Conversion Notice
 in which event the Corporation shall promptly return to the holder any original certificates representing Series B Preferred Stock delivered to the Corporation and the Holder shall promptly return to the Corporation the Common Stock certificates unsuccessfully tendered for conversion to the Corporation
 to the extent later received by the Holder.












. The Corporation&#8217;s obligation to issue and deliver the Conversion Shares upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock
 or any portion thereof
 in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional
 irrespective of any action or inaction by Holder to enforce the same
 any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof
 the recovery of any judgment against any person or entity
 or any action to enforce the same
 or any setoff
 counterclaim
 recoupment
 limitation or termination
 or any breach or alleged breach by such Holder or any other person or entity of any obligation to the Corporation or any violation or alleged violation of law by such Holder or any other person or entity
 and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Corporation to such Holder in connection with the issuance of such Conversion Shares; 
 
 that such delivery shall not operate as a waiver by the Corporation of any such action that the Corporation may have against such Holder.&#160;&#160;In the event Holder shall elect to convert the Series B Preferred Stock
 or any portion thereof
 the Corporation may not refuse conversion based on any claim that such Holder or anyone associated or affiliated with such Holder has been engaged in any violation of law
 agreement or for any other reason
 unless an injunction from a court
 on notice to Holder
 restraining and/or enjoining conversion of all or part of the Series B Preferred Stock by Holder shall have been sought and obtained
 and the Corporation posts a surety bond for the benefit of Holder in the amount of 150% of the aggregate value into which such Series B Preferred Stock are to be converted as provided above
 which bond shall remain in effect until the completion of litigation or other proceeding of the underlying dispute and the proceeds of which shall be payable to such Holder to the extent it obtains final adjudication. In the absence of such injunction
 the Corporation shall issue Conversion Shares upon a properly noticed conversion.&#160;&#160;If the Corporation fails to deliver to Holder the certificate or certificates representing the Conversion Shares by the Share Delivery Date
 the Corporation shall pay to such Holder
 in cash
 as liquidated damages and not as a penalty
 $500.00 per trading day (increasing to $1
) trading day after such damages begin to accrue) for each trading day after the Share Delivery Date until such certificates are delivered or Holder rescinds such conversion. Nothing herein shall limit Holder&#8217;s right to pursue actual damages for the Corporation&#8217;s failure to deliver Conversion Shares within the period specified herein and such Holder shall have the right to pursue all remedies available to it hereunder
 at law or in equity
 including
 without limitation
 a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief. The exercise of any such rights shall not prohibit Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof or under applicable law.












The Corporation shall pay all issue taxes
 if any
 incurred in respect of the issue of any Conversion Shares on conversion.











All shares of Common Stock which may be issued in connection with the conversion provisions set forth herein will
 upon issuance by the Corporation
 be validly issued
 fully paid and non-assessable
 free from preemptive rights and free from all taxes
 liens or charges with respect thereto created or imposed by the Corporation.


























.&#160;&#160;The Corporation shall at all times after July __
 2013 reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock
 solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock
 such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock based upon the VWAP at the end of the previous calendar month; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock
 the Corporation will call and hold a special meeting of the shareholders within seventy-five (75) business days of such occurrence
 for the sole purpose of increasing the number of shares authorized to an amount sufficient to allow a full conversion by the Holder of the Series B Preferred Stock. The Corporation&#8217;s management shall recommend to the shareholders to vote in favor of increasing the number of shares of Common Stock authorized.











.&#160;&#160;If: (A) the Corporation shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form) on any of its Common Stock
 (B) the Corporation shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of any of the Common Stock
 (C) the Corporation shall authorize the granting to all holders of&#160;&#160;Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or of any rights
 (D) the approval of any stockholders of the Corporation shall be required in connection with any reclassification of the Common Stock
 any consolidation or merger to which the Corporation is a party
 any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation
 of any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted into other securities
 cash or property
 or (E) the Corporation shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution
 liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation
 then
 in each case
 the Corporation shall cause to be filed at each office or agency maintained for the purpose of conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock
 and shall cause to be delivered to the Holder at its last address as it shall appear upon the Corporation&#8217;s records
 at least twenty (20) calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter specified
 a notice stating: (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend
 distribution
 redemption
 rights or warrants
 or if a record is not to be taken
 the date as of which the holders of the Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend
 distributions
 redemption
 rights or warrants are to be determined
 or (y) the date on which such reclassification
 consolidation
 merger
 sale
 transfer or share exchange is expected to become effective or close
 and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of the Common Stock for securities
 cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification
 consolidation
 merger
 sale
 transfer or share exchange
 provided that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein or in the delivery thereof shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice.&#160;&#160;The Holder is entitled to convert the Series B Preferred Stock during the 10-day period commencing on the date of such notice through the effective date of the event triggering such notice.



















.&#160;&#160;If any right
 preference or limitation of the Series B Preferred Stock set forth herein is invalid
 unlawful or incapable of being enforced by reason of any rule
 law or public policy
 all other rights
 preferences and limitations set forth herein that can be given effect without the invalid
 unlawful or unenforceable right
 preference or limitation shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect
 and no right
 preference or limitation herein shall be deemed dependent upon any other such right
 preference or limitation unless so expressed herein.

.&#160;&#160;This Certificate of Designation shall not be amended
 either directly or indirectly or through merger or consolidation with another entity
 in any manner that would alter or change the powers
 preferences or special rights of the Series B Preferred Stock so as to affect them materially and adversely without the consent of the Holder.&#160;&#160;Subject to the preceding sentence
 any amendment
 modification or waiver of any of the terms or provisions of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be binding upon the Holder.

.&#160;&#160;Upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation (an affidavit of the registered Holder shall be satisfactory) of the ownership and the loss
 theft
 destruction
 or mutilation of any certificate evidencing shares of Series B Preferred Stock
 and in the case of any such loss
 theft or destruction upon receipt of indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation (provided that if the Holder is a financial institution or other institutional investor its own agreement shall be satisfactory) or in the case of any such mutilation upon surrender of such certificate
 the Corporation
 at its expense
 shall execute and deliver in lieu of such certificate a new certificate of like kind representing the number of shares of such Series represented by such lost
 stolen
 destroyed or mutilated certificate and dated the date of such lost
 stolen
 destroyed or mutilated certificate.

.&#160;&#160;Any notice required by the provisions of this Certificate of Designation shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (i) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified; (ii) when sent by confirmed facsimile if sent during normal business hours of the recipient; if not

 notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents to the contrary
 each Revolving Loan requested by Borrowers under this Agreement shall be subject to Lender&#8217;s approval
 which approval may be given or withheld in Lender&#8217;s sole and absolute discretion.&#160;Revolving Loans made by Lender may be&#160;repaid&#160;and

&#160;&#160;Borrowers may request
 from time to time
 that the Revolving Loan Commitment be increased to up to Six Million Dollars ($6

000); and Lender
 in its sole discretion
 may make available Revolving Loan Commitment increases to Borrowers.&#160;&#160;&#160;Lender&#8217;s election to increase the Revolving Loan Commitment from time to time may be granted or denied by Lender in its sole and absolute discretion
 however
 at a minimum
 the following conditions must be satisfied
 in Lender&#8217;s sole and absolute discretion:


(i)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;no Event of Default shall have occurred or be continuing
 or result from the applicable increase of the Revolving Loan Commitment;





















(iii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After giving effect to such increase
 the amount of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all Revolving Loans shall not be in excess of the Revolving Loan Availability; and


(iv)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lender shall have reviewed and accepted
 in its sole and absolute discretion
 the amount and type of current and historical Receipts of the Borrower
 or other Collateral required for the increase.


&#160;&#160;Except as otherwise provided in this Section
 the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loans shall be repaid on or before the Revolving Loan Maturity Date.&#160;&#160;Principal amounts repaid on the Revolving Note may be re-borrowed.&#160;&#160;The principal amount of the Revolving Loans outstanding from time to time shall bear interest at the Interest Rate. The Receipts Collection Fee and accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal balance of all Revolving Loans outstanding from time to time shall be payable on a weekly basis on the weekly anniversary date of the Closing Date
 or such other date as Lender and Borrowers may agree upon
&#8221;).&#160;&#160;It is intended that payments required hereunder shall be paid on a Payment Date from Receipts received into the Lock Box Account in accordance with Section 2.1(e) below.&#160;&#160;In the event
 however
 there are no Receipts received into the Lockbox Account from which such payments can be made on any Payment Date
 the Borrowers shall pay directly to Lender
 on the Payment Date
 the Receipts Collection Fee and accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal balance of all Revolving Loans outstanding from time to time from the Borrowers&#8217; accounts. Any amount of principal or interest on the Revolving Loans which is not paid when due
 whether at stated maturity
 by acceleration or otherwise
 shall at Lender&#8217;s option bear interest payable on demand at the Default Rate.





&#160;&#160;All Revolving Loans hereunder shall be repaid by Borrowers on or before the Revolving Loan Maturity Date
 unless payable sooner pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.&#160;&#160;In the event the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all Revolving Loans hereunder exceed the Revolving Loan Availability
 Borrowers shall

 the Receipts Collection Fee
 received into the Lock Box Account as payment against the outstanding&#160;&#160;principal&#160;&#160;balance&#160;&#160;of&#160;&#160;the&#160;&#160;Revolving&#160;&#160;Loans&#160;&#160;on&#160;&#160;any&#160;&#160;Payment&#160;&#160;Date
&#160;&#160;or&#160;&#160;any&#160;&#160;such amounts may be left in the Lock Box Account as part of the Reserve Amount

hereunder

 the Prepayment Penalty shall be reduced&#160;&#160;to&#160;&#160;Two&#160;&#160;and&#160;&#160;One-Half&#160;&#160;percent&#160;&#160;(2.5%)&#160;&#160;if&#160;&#160;the&#160;&#160;prepayment&#160;&#160;and&#160;&#160;termination&#160;&#160;of&#160;&#160;the Revolving Loan Commitment occurs after the first One-Hundred Eighty (180) days following the Closing Date.

Lender makes the following representations and warranties to the Borrowers
 each of which shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the date of the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as of the date of each Loan made hereunder
 except to the extent such representation expressly relates to an earlier date
 and which shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement:


 Lender is acquiring the Revolving Note
 the Facility Fee Shares or the shares issuable upon conversion of the Revolving Note
 for its own account
 and not on behalf of any other Person
 for investment only and not with a view towards
 or for resale in connection with
 the public sale or distribution thereof
 except pursuant to sales registered or exempted under the Securities Act.&#160;&#160;Lender acknowledges and agrees that it did not become aware of the offering of the Revolving Note
 the Facility Fee Shares or the shares issuable upon conversion of the Revolving Note through any means of public advertising or general solicitation.






 Lender understands that the Revolving Note
 the Facility Fee Shares or the shares issuable upon conversion of the Revolving Note
 are each being offered and sold to it in reliance on specific exemptions from the registration requirements of United States federal and state securities laws and that Borrowers are relying in part upon the truth and accuracy of
 and Lender&#8217;s compliance with
 the representations
 warranties
 agreements
 acknowledgments and understandings of Lender set forth herein in order to determine the availability of such exemptions and the eligibility of Lender to acquire such securities.


 Lender has been furnished with all materials relating to the business
 finances and operations of Borrowers and information deemed material by Lender to making an

















informed investment decision regarding the Revolving Note
 which have been requested by Lender. Lender has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of Borrowers and their management.&#160;&#160;Neither such inquiries nor any other due diligence investigations conducted by Lender or its representatives shall modify
 above or in any other Loan Documents. Lender understands that its investment in the Revolving Note involves a high degree of risk. Lender is in a position regarding Borrowers
 which
 based upon economic bargaining power
 enabled and enables Lender to obtain information from Borrowers in order to evaluate the merits and risks of this investment. Lender has sought such accounting
 legal and tax advice
 as it has considered necessary to make an informed investment decision with respect to the Revolving Note.


 Lender understands that no United States federal or state agency or any other government or governmental agency has passed on or made any recommendation or endorsement of the Revolving Note
 or the fairness or suitability of the investment in the Revolving Note
 nor have such authorities passed upon or endorsed the merits of the offering of the Revolving Note.


&#160;&#160;Lender understands that: (i) the Revolving Note
 the Facility Fee Shares and the shares issuable upon conversion of the Revolving Note
 have not been and are not being registered under the Securities Act or any other foreign or state securities laws
 and may not be offered for sale
 sold
 assigned or transferred unless: (A) subsequently registered thereunder; or (B) Lender shall have delivered to Issuing Borrower an opinion of counsel
 in a generally acceptable form
 to the effect that such securities to be sold
 assigned or transferred may be sold
 assigned or transferred pursuant to an exemption from such registration requirements; and (ii) neither Borrower nor any other Person is under any obligation to register such securities under the Securities Act or any foreign or state securities laws or to comply with the terms and conditions of any exemption thereunder
 except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement.


 Lender represents that to the best of its knowledge and belief
 no part of the funds used by Lender for making any of the Revolving Loans was directly or indirectly derived from
 or related to
 any activity that may contravene federal
 state
 or international laws and regulations
 including anti-money laundering laws and regulations. To the best of Lender&#8217;s knowledge and belief
 Lender&#8217;s acquisition of the Revolving Note
 the Facility Fee Shares and the shares issuable upon conversion of the Revolving Note shall not cause any Borrower to violate any applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations including the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA Patriot Act) and regulations of the U.S. Department of the Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Lender further represents that it and its Affiliates are not acting directly or indirectly for or on behalf of any person
 group
 entity
 or nation named by any Executive Order of the U.S. as a terrorist
 Specially Designated National and Blocked Person (SDN) or other banned or blocked person
 entity
 nation
 or transaction pursuant to any law
 order
 rule
 or regulation that is enforced or administered by OFAC. Lender further&#160;&#160;represents&#160;&#160;that&#160;&#160;it&#160;&#160;and&#160;&#160;its&#160;&#160;Affiliates&#160;&#160;are&#160;&#160;not&#160;&#160;engaged&#160;&#160;in&#160;&#160;this&#160;&#160;transaction
&#160;&#160;directly&#160;&#160;or indirectly
 on behalf of
 or instigating or facilitating this transaction
 directly or indirectly

 the Company had an agreement with a finance company which provided financing up to $250
000
 secured by the specific goods underlying the goods ordered from the Company&amp;#39;s third-party manufacturer. The finance company made the required payment to the third-party manufacturer at the time a purchase order was placed
 and was entitled to demand payment from the Company when the goods were delivered. The Company paid a financing fee equal to 4.75% of the purchase order amount for each transaction
 plus administrative fees. Additional charges of 0.16% per day (57.6% annualized) were incurred if the financing remained open for more than 30 days. The inventory financing payable was $23

 artwork
 logos and other elements depicted in the 2009 movie
 &lt;font style=FONT-STYLE: italic; DISPLAY: inline&gt;The Hangover&lt;/font&gt;. This license
 as amended
 expires January 31
 2016. The terms of the WBCP license provide for royalties based on a percentage of products sold
 as defined
 subject to agreed-upon guaranteed minimum royalties. Guaranteed minimum royalty payments are made periodically over the term of the license and are recorded when paid as a prepaid expense in the balance sheet. The prepaid expense is amortized to royalties in cost of goods sold at a ratio of current period revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the term of the license. The Company reviews its sales projections quarterly to determine the likely recoverability of its prepaid asset
 as well as any unpaid minimum obligation. If management determines that the prepaid expense is unlikely to be recovered by product sales
 prepaid license expense is charged to cost of goods sold
 based on current and expected revenues

 no provision for income taxes has been provided in the accompanying combined financial statements because HOJ LLC and HOJ JV elected to file as partnerships

 HOJ began recording a provision for deferred income tax assets and liabilities in order to reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between (i) the tax basis of assets and liabilities and (ii) their reported amounts in the financial statements. The provision is based upon enacted tax laws and rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=DISPLAY: block; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt; text-align: justify; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt&gt; On July 25

 the Company acquired HOJ and began recording a provision for deferred income tax assets and liabilities. As of December 31

 the Company&amp;#39;s net deferred tax assets have been fully reserved

000 at December 31
 2012 relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets
 primarily net operating loss carry forwards in various tax jurisdictions. The Company continually assesses both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets can be realized prior to their expiration. Based on the Company&amp;#39;s assessment

 substantial changes in the Company&amp;#39;s ownership have occurred that may limit or reduce the amount of net operating loss carry-forward that the Company could utilize in the future to offset taxable income. The Company has not completed a detailed Section 382 study to determine what impact
 if any

 2012 and 2011
 the Company has not identified any unrecognized tax benefits or had any additions or reductions in tax positions and therefore a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is not presented. The Company does not have any unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31

 elected to file as partnerships
 and therefore management believes that prior to March 31
 2012 the Company was not subject to income taxes
 and
 that such taxes were the responsibility of the individual member/partners.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=DISPLAY: block; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt; text-align: justify; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt&gt; Beginning in March 2012
 as a corporation
 the Company now records a provision for deferred income tax assets and liabilities in order to reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between (i) the tax basis of assets and liabilities and (ii) their reported amounts in the financial statements. The provision is based upon enacted tax laws and rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. The Company expects to file income tax returns in the US Federal jurisdiction and various State jurisdictions.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=DISPLAY: block; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt; text-align: justify; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt&gt; The Company assesses the likelihood of the financial statement effect of a tax position that should be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority based on the technical merits of the tax position

 certain changes were made to images that were available to the Company under the original license agreement which required a re-design of certain packaging materials. The Company is able to use the existing packaging and promotional materials through March 31
 2013. Accordingly
 the Company evaluated the carrying value of the packing material on hand as of December 31
 2012 and recorded a write-down of inventory of $75
376 in the fourth quarter of 2012. The inventory write-down is included in costs of goods sold in the consolidated statement of operations for the year-end December 31

 &lt;font style=FONT-STYLE: italic; DISPLAY: inline&gt;Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS&lt;/font&gt;.

ASU 2011-04 changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2011-04 became effective for the Company on January 1

 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

 Inc. (AAEX) to facilitate the exchange of real estate properties between individuals under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. In February 2010
 Accredited Members
 Inc. (AMI)
 a provider of investor research and management services
 was merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAEX
 and AMI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In May 2010
 AAEX changed its name to Accredited Members Holding Corporation (AMHC).&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block&gt; &lt;div style=DISPLAY: block; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt; text-align: justify; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt&gt; On July 25
 2012
 the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the Merger Agreement) with Hangover Joe&amp;#39;s
 Inc.
 a privately-held Colorado corporation (HOJ)
 whereby on July 25
 2012
 the Company acquired HOJ in a reverse triangular merger (the Acquisition). Prior to the Acquisition
 the Company had 36
807
801shares outstanding. Upon closing the Acquisition
 the Company issued 83
514
827 common shares to the HOJ shareholders in exchange for all of their ownership interests in HOJ such that the former owners of HOJ owned approximately 69% of the Company post Acquisition. The shareholders of the Company prior to the Acquisition owned approximately 31% of the Company post Acquisition. In connection with the Acquisition on July 25
 2012
 the Company changed its name to Hangover Joe&amp;#39;s Holding Corporation.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=DISPLAY: block; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt; text-align: justify; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt&gt; The Merger Agreement further provided that within five business days after the closing of the Acquisition
 the Company would sell to Accredited Members Acquisition Corporation (Buyer) all of the equity interests in three of the Company&amp;#39;s subsidiaries (the Sale)
 being Accredited Members
 Inc.
 AMHC Managed Services
 Inc. and World Wide Premium Packers
 Inc. (collectively
 the Subsidiaries). Buyer is a privately-held Colorado corporation owned by two former directors of the Company
 JW Roth and David Lavigne. The parties closed the Sale on July 27
 2012. The Buyer paid $10
044 and assumed all liabilities related to the business of the Subsidiaries in exchange for all of the shares in the Subsidiaries owned by the Company.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=DISPLAY: block; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt; text-align: justify; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt&gt; HOJ is a Colorado corporation formed on March 5
 2012. HOJ was formed for the purpose of acquiring all of the assets of both Hangover Joe&amp;#39;s Products LLC (HOJ LLC) and Hangover Joe&amp;#39;s Joint Venture (HOJ JV). HOJ LLC had conducted operations through HOJ JV
 with the owner of HOJ LLC being one of the same owners and control persons of HOJ JV. Effective March 30
 2012
 HOJ acquired the net assets of HOJ LLC and HOJ JV through the issuance of common stock of HOJ. Because HOJ had no significant assets or business operations prior to the merger and each of these entities were owned by the same control group
 this transaction was accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control. Accordingly
 the historical results of operations of HOJ LLC and HOJ JV prior to March 30
 2012 are included in the results of operations of the Company.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=DISPLAY: block; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt; text-align: justify; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt&gt; Because all of the operating businesses of AMHC were contemporaneously sold within five business days after the Acquisition
 the transaction has been accounted for as a recapitalization of HOJ. Accordingly
 the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial position
 results of operations and cash flows of HOJ and its predecessor entities
 HOJ LLC and HOJ JV
 prior to the date of Acquisition. The historical results operations and cash flows of AMHC and the Subsidiaries prior to the date of the Acquisition have been excluded from the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The stockholders&amp;#39; equity of HOJ prior to the Acquisition has been retroactively restated for the equivalent number of shares received in the exchange after giving effect to any differences in the par value of the AMHC and HOJ common stock

 two-ounce beverage
 formulated to help relieve the symptoms associated with alcohol induced hangovers - the &lt;font style=FONT-STYLE: italic; DISPLAY: inline&gt;Hangover Recovery Shot&lt;/font&gt;. The &lt;font style=FONT-STYLE: italic; DISPLAY: inline&gt;Hangover Recovery Shot&lt;/font&gt; is an officially licensed product of &lt;font style=FONT-STYLE: italic; DISPLAY: inline&gt;The Hangover&lt;/font&gt; movie series from Warner Brothers. The Company has registered the trademark Hangover Joe&amp;#39;s Get Up &amp;amp; Go with the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. The assets consist of intellectual property relating to Hangover Joe&amp;#39;s Recovery Shot
 including but not limited to a license agreement dated July 19
 2011
 between HOJ LLC and Warner Bros. Consumer Products
 Inc. The license agreement permits HOJ to use the costumes
 artwork logos
 and other elements depicted in the 2009 movie The Hangover during the term of the license agreement
 as amended
 which expires January 31
 2016. The Company sells its products primarily to convenience stores
 liquor stores
 and grocery stores through distribution agreements
 as well as through online internet sales. The Company began selling a hangover recovery shot in February 2011 and began selling the licensed &lt;font style=FONT-STYLE: italic; DISPLAY: inline&gt;Hangover Joe&amp;#39;s Recovery Shot&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; in July 2011. HOJ is actively&lt;font style=DISPLAY: inline; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/font&gt; seeking to expand the distribution of the Hangover Joe&amp;#39;s Recovery Shot
 and has recently entered into distribution agreements to expand its reach to Australia

000 for the year ended December 31
 2012
 and a working capital deficiency and accumulated deficit of approximately $1
407
000 and $2
464
000
 respectively
 at December 31
 2012. The Company has a limited operating history and has relied primarily on debt financing and private placements of its common stock to fund its operations. The Company cannot provide any assurance it will be able to raise funds through a future issuance of debt or equity to carry out its business plan. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company&amp;#39;s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets

 the Company entered into a senior secured lending arrangement with TCA Global Credit Master Fund LP (TCA) for up to a maximum borrowing of $6
000
000. The credit facility has an initial line of credit of $425
000 with a six month term (and six month renewal option) and is collateralized by the assets of the Company. At closing
 the Company was advanced $425
000

 2013
 the Company executed a term sheet with an accredited investor (Investor) for a proposed investment of $1
000
000 in the Company in exchange for 15
000
000 shares of common stock
 5
000

Delivery is not considered to have occurred until the title and the risk of loss passes to the customer according to the terms of the contract between the Company and the customer. For sales to distributors
 revenue is usually recognized at the time of delivery. For sales through the Company&amp;#39;s website
 revenue is recognized at time of shipment.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=DISPLAY: block; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt; text-align: justify; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt&gt; Management evaluates the terms of its sales in consideration of the criteria outlined in &lt;font style=FONT-STYLE: italic; DISPLAY: inline&gt;Principal Agent Consideration&lt;/font&gt; with regards to its determination of gross versus net reporting of revenue for transactions with customers.

 through its website
 Hangover Joe&amp;#39;s Recovery Shots. In these transactions
 management has determined that the Company (i) acts as principal; (ii) has the risks and rewards of ownership
 including the risk of loss for collection
 delivery or returns; and (iii) has latitude in establishing price with the customer. For these transactions
 the Company recognizes revenue on a gross basis.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=DISPLAY: block; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt; text-align: justify; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt&gt; The Company offers a variety of incentives and discounts to distributors
 customers and consumers through various programs to support the distribution of its products. &lt;font style=BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; DISPLAY: inline&gt;These incentives and discounts include cash discounts
 price allowances
 volume based rebates and product placement fees. These incentives and discounts are reflected as a reduction of gross sales to arrive at net sales. The aggregate deductions from gross sales recorded in relation to these programs were approximately $43

 &lt;font style=FONT-STYLE: italic; DISPLAY: inline&gt;The Hangover&lt;/font&gt;. This license
 as amended
 expires January 31
 2016. The terms of the WBCP license provide for royalties based on a percentage of products sold
 as defined
 subject to agreed-upon guaranteed minimum royalties. Guaranteed minimum royalty payments are made periodically over the term of the license and are recorded when paid as a prepaid expense in the balance sheet. The prepaid expense is amortized to royalties in cost of goods sold at a ratio of current period revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the term of the license. The Company reviews its sales projections quarterly to determine the likely recoverability of its prepaid asset
 as well as any unpaid minimum obligation. If management determines that the prepaid expense is unlikely to be recovered by product sales
 prepaid license expense is charged to cost of goods sold

Delivery is not considered to have occurred until the title and the risk of loss passes to the customer according to the terms of the contract between the Company and the customer.

 customers and consumers through various programs to support the distribution of its products. &lt;font style=BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; DISPLAY: inline&gt;These incentives and discounts include cash discounts

 co-packing fees
 and in-bound freight charges. Raw material costs account for the largest portion of the cost of goods sold. Raw materials include bottles

 and it relies on third-party manufacturers for the production of its product. Although the Company believes that it could utilize alternative suppliers and manufacturers
 any delay in locating and establishing relationships with other suppliers/manufacturers could result in product shortages and back orders for the products
 with a resulting loss of net sales and profitability. The Company&amp;#39;s third-party manufacturer acquires some ingredients from suppliers outside of the United States. Purchasing these ingredients is subject to the risks generally associated with importing raw materials from other countries

 the Company granted a warrant to a sales consultant and director of the Company to purchase up to 6
129
528 shares of common stock in connection with a two-year service agreement. This warrant has a three-year term and an exercise price of $0.0326 per share with 3
064
764 shares vesting each on January 1
 2013 and January 1
 2014 if the Company&amp;#39;s sales exceed certain thresholds in 2012 and 2013
 respectively. On January 1
 2013
 the board of directors concluded the sales target for 2012 was not met and warrants to purchase 3
064
764 shares of Company common stock were cancelled. Management has evaluated the performance criteria and currently does not anticipate that the sales thresholds for 2013 will be met and accordingly no stock-based compensation has been recognized during the year ended December 31
 2012. Compensation cost is revised if subsequent information indicates that the actual number of warrants vested is likely to differ from previous estimates.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=DISPLAY: block; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt; text-align: justify; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt&gt; In December 2012
 the Company granted a warrant to an investor relations firm to purchase up to 100
000 shares of common stock that vested immediately. This warrant has a three-year term and an exercise price of $0.11 per share
 and $17
549 of stock based compensation related to this warrant has been recognized in general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31

 2012
 the Company&amp;#39;s owners/officers contributed management and administrative services to the Company. The fair value of those services has been recorded as an expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements based on the estimated fair value for such services
 with a corresponding credit to contributed capital. The fair value of the historical services was estimated based on the compensation per employment terms that were entered into in March 2012. Contributed services were $50

 In connection with the Warner Brothers license renewal in January 2013
 certain changes were made to images that were available to the Company under the original license agreement which required a re-design of certain packaging materials. The Company is able to use the existing packaging and promotional materials through March 31
 2013. Accordingly
 the Company evaluated the carrying value of the packing material on hand as of December 31
 2012 and recorded a write-down of inventory of $75
376 in the fourth quarter of 2012. The inventory write-down is included in costs of goods sold in the consolidated statement of operations for the year-end December 31
 2012.
