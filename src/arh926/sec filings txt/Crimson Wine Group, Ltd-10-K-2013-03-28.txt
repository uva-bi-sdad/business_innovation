Crimson Wine Group
 Ltd. qualifies as an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; pursuant to the provisions of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the &#8220;JOBS Act&#8221;)
 enacted on April 5
 2012. For as long as Crimson Wine Group
 Ltd. remains an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; as defined in the JOBS Act
 we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other reporting companies which are not &#8220;emerging growth companies
&#8221; including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this Annual Report on Form 10&#8722;K (&#8220;Form 10&#8722;K&#8221;). Therefore
 this Form 10&#8722;K does not include certain information regarding executive compensation that may be found in the annual reports of other reporting companies.













Crimson Wine Group
 Ltd. (&#8220;Crimson&#8221;) is a Delaware company whose business has been operating since 1991.&#160;&#160;As used herein
 the term
 &#8220;Company&#8221; refers to Crimson and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
 except as the context may otherwise require.&#160;&#160;Prior to February 25
 2013
 Crimson was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Leucadia National Corporation (&#8220;Leucadia&#8221;).&#160;&#160;On February 1
 2013
 Leucadia declared a pro rata dividend of all of the outstanding shares of Crimson&#8217;s common stock in a manner that was structured to qualify as a tax-free spin-off for U.S. federal income tax purposes (the &#8220;Distribution&#8221;).&#160;&#160;Leucadia&#8217;s common shareholders received one share of Crimson common stock for every ten common shares of Leucadia
 with cash in lieu of fractional shares
 on February 25
 2013.


Crimson operates in one segment
 the production and sale of premium
 ultra premium and luxury wines (i.e.
 wines that retail for $10 to $14
 $14 to $25 and over $25 per 750ml bottle
 respectively).&#160;&#160;Crimson is headquartered in Napa
 California and through its subsidiaries owns four wineries:&#160;&#160;Pine Ridge Vineyards
 Archery Summit
 Chamisal Vineyards and Seghesio Family Vineyards.&#160;&#160;Pine Ridge Vineyards was acquired in 1991 and has been conducting operations since 1978
 Crimson started Archery Summit in 1993
 Chamisal Vineyards was acquired in 2008 and has been conducting operations since 1973
 and Seghesio Family Vineyards was acquired in 2011 and has been conducting operations since 1895.&#160;&#160;Additionally
 in 2005 and 2006 Crimson acquired Double Canyon Vineyards
 an aggregate of 611 acres of land in the Horse Heaven Hills of Washington&#8217;s Columbia Valley.&#160;&#160;References to cases of wine herein refer to nine-liter equivalent cases.





Pine Ridge Vineyards owns 156 acres
 which reflects the sale of 12 plantable acres of a non-strategic vineyard in January 2013
 and controls through leasing arrangements an additional 20 acres of estate vineyards in five Napa Valley appellations&#8212;Stags Leap District
 Rutherford
 Oakville
 Carneros and Howell Mountain.&#160;&#160;Approximately 161 acres are currently planted and producing grapes.&#160;&#160;The winery and production facilities at Pine Ridge Vineyards have a permitted annual wine production capacity of up to 300
000 gallons
 which equates to approximately 126
000 cases of wine; however
 current fermentation and processing capacity is limited to approximately 80
000 cases without additional capital investment.&#160;&#160;The facility includes areas and equipment for traditional crush
 fermentation
 aging and bottling processes
 and also has a tasting room
 hospitality center and administrative offices.&#160;&#160;Built into the hillside for wine barrel storage are approximately 34
000 square feet of underground caves with a capacity to store over 4
000 barrels.&#160;&#160;In addition
 there are special event dining areas both indoors and outdoors as well as in the underground caves.


The Pine Ridge Vineyards estate business is focused primarily on the production of high quality Cabernet Sauvignon and bordeaux-style blends sold by Crimson under the Pine Ridge Vineyards brand name.&#160;&#160;Pine Ridge Vineyards also produces Chenin Blanc + Viogner
 a wine made from purchased grapes and processed at a third party custom winemaking facility
 which is sold by Crimson under the Pine Ridge Vineyards brand name.





Archery Summit owns 100 acres and controls through leasing arrangements an additional 20 acres of estate vineyards in the Willamette Valley
 Oregon.&#160;&#160;Approximately 110 acres are currently planted and producing grapes.&#160;&#160;The winery and production facilities at Archery Summit have a permitted annual wine production capacity of up to 50
000 gallons
 which equates to approximately 21
000 cases of wine; however
 current fermentation and processing capacity is limited to approximately 15
000 cases.&#160;&#160;The facility includes areas and equipment for gravity flow of wine with quality oriented crush
 fermentation
 aging and bottling processes
 and also has a tasting room
 hospitality center and administrative offices.&#160;&#160;The facility has approximately 8
300 square feet of underground caves for wine barrel storage with a capacity to store over 600 barrels.&#160;&#160;In addition
 there are special event dining areas indoors as well as in the underground caves.


Archery Summit is focused primarily on producing estate grown
 expressive single vineyard Pinot Noir from tightly spaced vines sold by Crimson under the Archery Summit brand name.





















Chamisal Vineyards owns 97 acres of vineyards in the Edna Valley
 California
 of which 74 acres are currently planted and producing grapes.&#160;&#160;The Chamisal Vineyard was the first vineyard planted in the Edna Valley in 1973.&#160;&#160;The winery and production facilities at Chamisal have a permitted annual wine production capacity of up to 100
000 gallons which equates to 42
000 cases of wine and expects to complete a project in 2013 that will increase permitted capacity to 238
000 gallons which equates to approximately 100
000 cases of wine.&#160;&#160;The facility includes areas and equipment for quality oriented modern crush
 fermentation
 aging and bottling processes
 as well as a tasting room
 hospitality center and administrative offices.&#160;&#160;There are special event dining areas outdoors.


Chamisal is focused on producing estate grown
 expressive single vineyard Chardonnay and Pinot Noir as well as a Stainless Chardonnay produced from both purchased and estate grown grapes.&#160;&#160;The wines are sold by Crimson under the Chamisal Vineyards brand name.





Seghesio Family Vineyards owns 299 acres of estate vineyards in two Sonoma County
 California appellations
 the Alexander Valley and the Russian River Valley
 of which approximately 267 acres are planted and producing grapes.&#160;&#160;Seghesio Family Vineyards has a long history of growing and producing Zinfandel and Italian varietal wines in the Sonoma region of California.&#160;&#160;The winery and production facilities at Seghesio Family Vineyards have a permitted annual wine production capacity of up to 404
000 gallons which equates to approximately 170
000 cases of wine; however
 current fermentation and processing capacity is limited to approximately 120
000 cases.&#160;&#160;Crimson expects to complete a project in 2013 that will increase fermentation and processing capacity to 170
000 cases.&#160;&#160;The facility includes areas and equipment for traditional crush
 fermentation
 aging
 bottling and warehousing processes
 as well as a tasting room
 private hospitality areas and administrative offices.&#160;&#160;There are indoor and outdoor special event dining areas.&#160;&#160;In Alexander Valley
 Seghesio Family Vineyards also owns a historic non-operating winery
 mansion and train station
 which Crimson intends to convert into educational
 tasting
 hospitality and potentially incremental production facilities.








Double Canyon Vineyards owns 462 acres of vineyards in the Horse Heaven Hills
 Washington
 of which 87 acres are currently planted and producing grapes.&#160;&#160;Crimson continues to evaluate the best use of the remaining acres; currently most are leased to a farming company for growing vegetables.&#160;&#160;Currently
 Double Canyon Vineyards sells the majority of its grapes to third parties and does not have any wine production facilities. Starting with the 2010 vintage
 Double Canyon Vineyards produced and bottled
 at an offsite custom crush winery
 the first wine under the Double Canyon Vineyards brand name which was released in the Fall of 2012.





The premium
 ultra premium and luxury market segments of the wine industry are intensely competitive.&#160;&#160;Crimson&#8217;s wines compete domestically and internationally
 and premium or higher quality wines are produced in Europe
 South America
 South Africa
 Australia and New Zealand
 as well as in the United States.&#160;&#160;Crimson competes on the basis of quality
 price
 brand recognition and distribution capability
 and the ultimate consumer has many choices of products from both domestic and international producers.&#160;&#160;A result of the intense competition has been and may continue to be upward pressure on Crimson&#8217;s selling and promotional expenses.&#160;&#160;Many of Crimson&#8217;s competitors are significantly larger with greater financial
 production
 distribution and marketing resources.&#160;&#160;Wine production in the U.S. is dominated by three large California wineries that represent over 60% of the domestic U.S. case sales volume. Further
 Crimson&#8217;s wines may be considered to compete with all alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages.


Demand for wine in the premium
 ultra premium and luxury market segments can rise and fall with general economic conditions
 and is also significantly affected by grape supply.&#160;&#160;Based on industry wide volume increases in this wine category
 Crimson believes more people are drinking wine than in the past; however
 in the current economic climate
 consumer demand has shifted away from the higher priced luxury segment to wines in the lower priced premium and ultra premium categories.&#160;&#160;Currently
 the fastest growing segment in the domestic wine market is for wines priced in the $14 to $25 retail price range.&#160;&#160;Crimson has adjusted its strategy to address lower consumer spending levels
 and has been successful in selling its wine at price points in the fast growing $14 to $25 price range.&#160;&#160;However
 if conditions worsen and Crimson is forced to reduce prices further
 it may not be able to do so profitably.





















During the past few years Crimson has focused on brand development and distribution to increase revenues and profitability
 which has included acquisitions of vineyards and wineries and the development of new brands with existing assets.


Crimson&#8217;s sales and marketing team coordinates the sales and distribution of its various brands
 is responsible for maintaining domestic and export distributor relationships and oversees the timing and allocation of new releases.&#160;&#160;The sales team has employees in certain key markets in the U.S. and internationally as well as brokers in certain markets.&#160;&#160;Its wines are available through many principal retail channels for premium table wines
 including fine wine restaurants
 hotels
 specialty shops
 supermarkets and club stores
 in all states domestically and in over 40 countries throughout the world.


Generally
 Crimson will enter into agreements with brokers for those markets where it would not be cost effective to have an employee
 or if the products are being sold to a customer who usually purchases products from brokers.&#160;&#160;Crimson may also use brokers if they represent the best distribution channel after considering local regulatory requirements.&#160;&#160;On an on-going basis the Company continues to evaluate the use of brokers in its various markets; during 2012
 brokers were used by Crimson in 10 states in the U.S. and in certain export markets.&#160; Revenues generated through broker relationships represented approximately 7% of wine revenues during 2012.&#160;&#160;Agreements with brokers are generally terminable by either party upon notice.


Crimson&#8217;s wines are primarily sold to distributors
 who then sell to retailers and restaurants.&#160;&#160;Domestic sales of Crimson&#8217;s wines are made through more than 70 independent wine and spirits distributors.&#160;&#160;International sales are made through independent importers and brokers.


As permitted under federal and local regulations
 Crimson has been placing increasing emphasis on direct sales to consumers
 which it is able to do through the Internet
 wine clubs
 and at the wineries&#8217; tasting rooms.&#160;&#160;During 2012
 direct sales to consumers represented 14% of case sales and 40% of wine revenues.&#160;&#160;Approximately 58% of the direct to consumer sales were through wine clubs
 28% were through the wineries&#8217; tasting rooms and the balance from the Internet.&#160;&#160;Members typically join our wine clubs after visiting our tasting rooms at our various facilities
 or after hearing about our wine clubs from other members.&#160;&#160;Our tasting rooms are located in vacation areas that typically attract consumers interested in wine making and touring the area.&#160;&#160;Direct sales to consumers are more profitable for Crimson as it is able to sell its products at a price closer to retail prices rather than the wholesale price received from distributors.


Crimson&#8217;s wines are distributed in California
 Illinois
 Colorado
 Oregon
 Hawaii
 New Mexico
 Arizona
 Washington and Nevada predominantly by Southern Wine and Spirits.&#160;&#160;During 2012
 sales to Southern Wine and Spirits accounted for 19% of case volume and 14% of wine sales.&#160;&#160;Sales for the top ten distributors accounted for 64% of volume and 48% of wine sales.&#160;&#160;These distributors also offer premium table wines of other companies that directly compete with Crimson&#8217;s products.


Domestic distributor wine sales are concentrated in certain states
 with California accounting for 17% of case volume and 13% of wine sales during 2012.&#160;&#160;Other major domestic markets include New Jersey
 Texas
 Florida
 Massachusetts
 Illinois
 Minnesota and Virginia where sales represented 34% of case volume and 25% of wine sales during 2012.&#160;&#160;The acquisition of Seghesio Family Vineyards significantly increased Crimson&#8217;s export sales.&#160;&#160;Historically
 Seghesio&#8217;s export sales were 20% of case volume and 15% of its wine sales and Crimson is currently expanding the export of products from its other wineries through Seghesio&#8217;s international distribution channels.


For the year ended December 31
 2012
 export sales were 8% of case volume and 7% of wine sales as compared to the year ended December 31
 2011
 when exports sales were 2% of case volume and 2% of wine sales
 an increase that reflects the acquisition of Seghesio Family Vineyards in May 2011.


Crimson believes that the quality and locations of its wineries and tasting facilities help to create demand for its brands at the consumer level which positively impacts sales to distributors as well.&#160;&#160;Crimson participates in many wine tasting and other promotional events throughout the country in order to increase awareness and demand for its products.&#160;&#160;Many of Crimson&#8217;s brands are issued ratings or scores by local and national wine rating organizations
 and higher scores will usually translate into greater demand and higher pricing.&#160;&#160;Although some of Crimson&#8217;s brands are or have been highly rated in the past
 and Crimson believes its farming and winemaking activities are of a quality to generate good ratings in the future
 Crimson has no control over ratings issued by third parties which may not be favorable in the future.





















Crimson controls approximately 1
166 acres of vineyards in the Napa Valley
 Sonoma County and Edna Valley in California
 the Willamette Valley in Oregon and Horse Heaven Hills in Washington; approximately 709 acres of these vineyards are planted
 with the majority of the unplanted acres in Washington.&#160;&#160;While Crimson does not have any immediate plans to plant the additional Washington acres
 it does expect to continue vineyard development plans for the non-producing California and Oregon properties.&#160;&#160;Additionally
 on an annual basis
 excluding the Washington property
 Crimson has typically had 4% to 6% development of vineyard acreage.&#160;&#160;Newly planted vines take approximately four to five years to reach maturity and vineyards can be expected to have a useful life of 25 years before replanting is necessary.&#160;&#160;Depending on the site
 soil and water conditions and spacing
 Crimson&#8217;s experience has been that it costs approximately $30
000 to $65
000 per acre over a three to four year period to develop open land into a producing premium wine grape vineyard
 before taking into account the cost of the land.&#160;&#160;With over 700 acres of planted estate holdings
 Crimson could have annual capital investment requirements of $800
000 to $1
000
000 to replace existing vineyard sites as their economic useful life expires.


In 2012
 approximately 39% of Crimson&#8217;s total grape supply came from Crimson controlled vineyards; however
 substantially all of the grape supply for Pine Ridge Vineyards Napa and Archery Summit is from Crimson controlled vineyards.&#160;&#160;Crimson purchases the balance of its California supply from approximately 65 independent growers.&#160;&#160;The grower contracts range from one-year spot market purchases to intermediate and long term-agreements.&#160;&#160;No one grower represents more than 10% of Crimson&#8217;s grape supply.&#160;&#160;The top ten growers represent 37% of Crimson&#8217;s total grape supply.


Winemaking and grape growing are subject to a variety of agricultural risks.&#160;&#160;Various diseases
 pests and certain weather conditions can materially and adversely affect the quality and quantity of grapes available to Crimson thereby materially and adversely affecting the supply of Crimson&#8217;s products and its profitability.

Cases sold were 260
000
 212
000 and 111
000 for the years ended December 31
 2012
 2011 and 2010
 respectively.&#160;&#160;Cases sold are disclosed for informational purposes
 but do not necessarily correspond to the vintage year the grapes are grown and crushed.&#160;&#160;Depending on the wine
 the production cycle to bottled sales is anywhere from one to three years.&#160;&#160;The large increase in production in 2012 was due to a much larger crop in 2012 as well as planned production increases for certain brands.&#160;&#160;The large increase in 2011 as compared to 2010 was due to the acquisition of Seghesio Family Vineyards.





Crimson&#8217;s winemaking philosophy includes both the use of the latest in current industry winemaking advances to complement making wine in the traditional manner by starting with high quality fruit and handling it as gently and naturally as possible all the way to the bottle.&#160;&#160;Each of Crimson&#8217;s wineries is equipped with modern crush
 fermentation and storage equipment as well as technology that is focused on producing the highest quality wines for each of the varietals it produces.





















Wine production and sales are subject to extensive regulation by the Federal Trade and Tax Bureau
 the California Department of Alcohol Beverage Control and other state and federal governmental authorities that regulate interstate sales
 licensing
 trade and pricing practices
 labeling
 advertising and other activities. In recent years
 federal and state authorities have required warning labels on beverages containing alcohol.&#160;&#160;Restrictions or taxes imposed by government authorities on the sale of wine could increase the retail price of wine
 which could have an adverse effect on demand for wine in general. New or revised regulations or increased licensing fees or excise taxes on wine
 if enacted
 could reduce demand for wine and have an adverse effect on Crimson&#8217;s business
 negatively impacting Crimson&#8217;s results of operations and cash flows.


Crimson is subject to a broad range of federal and state regulatory requirements regarding its operations and practices.&#160;&#160;Crimson&#8217;s operations are subject to regulations governing the storage and use of fertilizers
 fungicides
 herbicides
 pesticides
 fuels
 solvents and other chemicals.&#160;&#160;These regulations are subject to change and conceivably could have a significant impact on operating practices
 chemical usage
 and other aspects of Crimson&#8217;s business.





There is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles
 procurement and transportation of grapes.&#160;&#160;The wine industry in general historically experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenues and net income.&#160;&#160;Typically
 Crimson has lower sales and net income during the first quarter and higher sales and net income during the third and fourth quarters. Crimson expects this trend to continue.&#160;&#160;Sales can also fluctuate significantly between quarters depending on the timing of certain holidays and promotional periods
 timing of wine club shipments and on the rate at which distributor inventories are depleted through sales to wine retailers.





At December 31
 2012
 Crimson employed approximately 143 regular
 full-time employees. Crimson also employs part-time and seasonal workers for its vineyard
 production and hospitality operations.&#160;&#160;None of Crimson&#8217;s employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit and Crimson believes that its relationship with its employees is good.





Crimson maintains federal trademark registrations for its brands
 proprietary products and certain logos
 motifs and vineyard names.&#160;&#160;International trademark registrations are also maintained where it is appropriate to do so.&#160;&#160;Each of the United States trademark registrations is renewable indefinitely so long as the Company is making a bona fide usage of the trademark.

 the Company files periodic reports

 we have reviewed our long-lived assets for potential impairment and have recorded adjustments to the book value of long-lived assets as appropriate.&#160;&#160;If operating revenues deteriorate in the future
 and/or we lower our estimates of future cash flows
 significant impairment charges might have to be recorded.


Our success depends to some degree upon the continued service of Erle Martin
 our President and Chief Executive Officer
 and Patrick DeLong
 our Chief Financial &amp; Operating Officer
 and our winemakers at our various facilities.&#160;&#160;The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees could harm our business and our reputation and negatively impact our profitability
 particularly if one or more of our key employees resigns to join a competitor or to form a competing company.


We compete with other entities for skilled management and staff employees
 including entities that operate in different market sectors than us.&#160;&#160;Costs to recruit and retain adequate personnel could adversely affect results of operations.


We will initially rely on Leucadia to meet certain financial reporting requirements of a public company
 and should Leucadia cease to provide these functions

 we became subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and are required to prepare and file our financial statements according to the rules and regulations required by the SEC.&#160;&#160;Historically
 we have prepared our own financial and tax information and provided it to Leucadia so that Leucadia could meet its SEC and tax filing requirements
 but do not currently have the ability to meet these reporting requirements on our own.&#160;&#160;Compliance with these rules may be costly
 and failure to prepare and disclose required information or otherwise comply with applicable law could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws
 expose us to lawsuits and restrict our ability to access financing.


We rely on Leucadia for these and other services pursuant to the administrative services agreement that we entered into with Leucadia.&#160;&#160;The administrative services agreement has an initial term of one year
 an evergreen renewal for subsequent annual periods and will be terminable to either party on six months prior notice.&#160;&#160;For more information
 see Item 13
 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence.&#160;&#160;If Leucadia becomes unwilling or unable to provide the services in the future we will have to establish these functions in-house to ensure we meet the reporting requirements of a stand-alone public company.


Due to our separation from Leucadia

 stand-alone Delaware franchise tax
 increased legal and accounting fees for reviews of the Company&#8217;s publicly filed financial statements
 proxy and other filings and other services.&#160;&#160;The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we
 among other things
 establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and disclosure purposes.&#160;&#160;Establishing and monitoring these controls will result in additional costs to us and require us to divert important resources
 including management time
 from other activities.&#160;&#160;Increased costs that we incur as a stand-alone public company will reduce our profitability.


















Various diseases
Various diseases
 pests
 fungi
 viruses
 drought
 frosts and certain other weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity of grapes
 decreasing the supply of our products and negatively impacting our operating results.&#160;&#160;Future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in grape growing may increase vineyard costs and/or reduce production.&#160;&#160;We cannot guarantee that our grape suppliers will succeed in preventing disease in their existing vineyards or that we will succeed in preventing disease in our existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire.&#160;&#160;For instance
 Pierce&#8217;s disease is a vine bacterial disease which kills grapevines and there is no known cure.&#160;&#160;Small insects called sharpshooters spread this disease.&#160;&#160;A new strain of the sharpshooter was discovered in Southern California and is believed to be migrating north.&#160;&#160;If our vineyards become contaminated with this or other diseases
 operating results would decline
 perhaps significantly.


While we believe that we can secure sufficient supplies of grapes from a combination of our own production and from grape supply contracts with independent growers
 we cannot be certain that grape supply shortages will not occur.&#160;&#160;Grape supply shortages resulting from a poor harvest can be caused by a variety of factors outside our control
 resulting in reduced product that is available for sale.&#160;&#160;If revenues decline as a result of inadequate grape supplies
 cash flows and profitability would also decline.


The wine industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented.&#160;&#160;Our wines compete in several wine market segments with many other domestic and foreign wines.&#160;&#160;Our wines also compete with popular priced generic wines and with other alcoholic and
 to a lesser degree
 non-alcoholic beverages.&#160;&#160;A result of this intense competition has been and may continue to be upward pressure on our selling and promotional expenses.&#160;&#160;Many of our competitors have greater financial
 technical
 marketing and public relations resources than we do.&#160;&#160;There can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to successfully compete with our competitors or that we will not face greater competition from other wineries and beverage manufacturers.


We compete for shelf space in retail stores and for marketing focus by our independent distributors

 restaurants
 hotels and private clubs across the U.S. and in some overseas markets.&#160;&#160;Sales to distributors are expected to continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenues in the future.&#160;&#160;A change in our relationship with any of our significant distributors could harm our business and reduce our sales.&#160;&#160;The laws and regulations of several states prohibit changes of distributors
 except under certain limited circumstances
 making it difficult to terminate a distributor for poor performance without reasonable cause
 as defined by applicable statutes.&#160;&#160;Any difficulty or inability to replace distributors
 poor performance of our major distributors or our inability to collect accounts receivable from our major distributors could harm our business.&#160;&#160;There can be no assurance that the distributors and retailers we use will continue to purchase our products or provide our products with adequate levels of promotional support.&#160;&#160;Consolidation at the retail tier
 among club and chain grocery stores in particular
 can be expected to heighten competitive pressure to increase marketing and sales spending or constrain or reduce prices.


We are subject to certain hazards and product liability risks
 such as potential contamination
 through tampering or otherwise
 of ingredients or products.&#160;&#160;Contamination of any of our wines could cause us to destroy our wine held in inventory and could cause the need for a product recall
 which could significantly damage our reputation for product quality.&#160;&#160;We maintain insurance against certain of these kinds of risks
 and others
 under various insurance policies.&#160;&#160;However
 our insurance may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at a price or on terms that are satisfactory to us and this insurance may not be adequate to cover any resulting liability.


There have been periods in the past in which there were substantial declines in the overall per capita consumption of wine products in our markets.&#160;&#160;A limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors
 including: a general decline in economic conditions; changes in consumer spending habits; increased concern about the health consequences of consuming alcoholic beverage products and about drinking and driving; a trend toward a healthier diet including lighter
 lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks
 juices and water products; the increased activity of anti-alcohol consumer groups; and increased federal
 state or foreign excise and other taxes on alcoholic beverage products.&#160;&#160;Reductions in demand and revenues would reduce profitability and cash flows.


Many of Crimson&#8217;s brands are issued ratings or scores by local and national wine rating organizations
 and higher scores usually translate into greater demand and higher pricing.&#160;&#160;Although some of Crimson&#8217;s brands have been highly rated in the past
 and Crimson believes its farming and winemaking activities are of a quality to generate good ratings in the future
 Crimson has no control over ratings issued by third parties which may not be favorable in the future.


















Climate change
 or legal
 regulatory or market measures to address climate change
 may negatively affect our business
 operations or financial performance
Our business depends upon agricultural activity and natural resources
 including the availability of water.&#160;&#160;There has been much public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures
 weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters.&#160;&#160;Severe weather events and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in our vineyards.&#160;&#160;The quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of grapes and our ability to operate our business.&#160;&#160;Adverse weather
 measures enacted to address climate change
 and other environmental factors beyond our control could reduce our grape production and adversely impact our cash flows and profitability.


We are subject to environmental regulations with respect to our operations
 including those related to wastewater
 air emissions
 and hazardous materials use
 storage and disposal.&#160;&#160;In addition
 we own substantial amounts of real property that are critical to our business.&#160;&#160;If hazardous substances are discovered on any of our properties and the concentrations are such that the presence of such hazardous substances presents an unreasonable risk of harm to public health or the environment
 we may be held strictly liable for the cost of investigation and remediation of hazardous substances.&#160;&#160;The cost of environmental remediation could be significant and adversely impact our financial condition
 results of operations and cash flows.


In March 2013
 we entered into a revolving credit facility with American AgCredit
 FLCA and CoBank
 FCB as joint lenders that is secured by substantially all of our assets.&#160;&#160;We plan to rely upon the revolving credit facility for working capital funding and in the future may use it for acquisitions.&#160;&#160;The revolving credit facility includes covenants that require the maintenance of specified debt and equity ratios
 limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness
 limit dividends and other distributions to shareholders and limit certain mergers
 consolidations and sales of assets.&#160;&#160;If we are unable to comply with these covenants
 outstanding amounts could become immediately due and/or there could be a substantial increase in the rate of borrowing.


Government laws and regulations result in increased farming costs
 and the sale of wine is subject to taxation in various state
 federal and foreign jurisdictions.&#160;&#160;The amount of wine that we can sell directly to consumers outside of California is regulated
 and in certain states we are not allowed to sell wines directly to consumers and/or the amount that can be sold is limited.&#160;&#160;Changes in these laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on sales and/or increase costs to produce and/or sell wine.&#160;&#160;The wine industry is subject to extensive regulation by the Federal Alcohol Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (&#8220;TTB&#8221;) and various foreign agencies
 state liquor authorities
 such as the California Alcoholic Beverage Control (&#8220;CABC&#8221;)
 and local authorities.&#160;&#160;These regulations and laws dictate such matters as licensing requirements
 trade and pricing practices
 permitted distribution channels
 permitted and required labeling
 and advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers.&#160;&#160;Any expansion of our existing facilities or development of new vineyards or wineries may be limited by present and future zoning ordinances
 environmental restrictions and other legal requirements.&#160;&#160;In addition
 new regulations or requirements or increases in excise taxes
 income taxes
 property and sales taxes or international tariffs
 could affect our financial condition or results of operations.&#160;&#160;Recently
 many states have considered proposals to increase
 and some of these states have increased
 state alcohol excise taxes.&#160;&#160;New or revised regulations or increased licensing fees
 requirements or taxes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
 results of operations or cash flows.





We may be subject to litigation
 for which we may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure and which if adversely determined

 if our assessment proves to be in error
 then the outcome of litigation could have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations or cash flows.





If our intangible assets or goodwill become impaired

 in particular the acquisition of Seghesio Family Vineyards.&#160;&#160;We review intangible assets and goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired.&#160;&#160;Application of impairment tests requires judgment.&#160;&#160;A significant deterioration in a key estimate or assumption or a less significant deterioration to a combination of assumptions or the sale of a part of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in the future
 which could have a significant adverse impact on our reported earnings.


















&#160;&#160;Prices for our common stock are quoted on the Over-The-Counter (OTC) Link.&#160;&#160;Securities whose prices are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board do not have the same liquidity as securities that trade on a recognized market or securities exchange.&#160;&#160;An active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained in the future.&#160;&#160;As a result
 stockholders may find it more difficult to dispose of or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock.


The stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.&#160;&#160;Changes in earnings estimates by analysts
 if any
 and economic and other external factors may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock.&#160;&#160;Fluctuations or decreases in the trading price of our common stock may also adversely affect the liquidity of the trading market for our common stock.


The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur.&#160;&#160;These sales
 or the possibility that these sales may occur
 also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.&#160;&#160;Any disposition by any of our large shareholders of our common stock in the public market
 or the perception that such dispositions could occur
 could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.


Changing laws
 regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure
 including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
 are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours.&#160;&#160;We are committed to maintaining appropriate corporate governance and public disclosure.&#160;&#160;As a result
 we may see an increase in general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities
 which could harm our business prospects.


We are an &#8220;emerging growth company
&#8221; as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the &#8220;JOBS Act&#8221;) and have taken advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies
 including
 but not limited to
 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements
 and exemptions from the requirement of holding a nonbinding stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation
 frequency of approval of executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved.&#160;&#160;We will retain emerging growth company status until the earliest of:&#160;&#160;(1) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date we first sold securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act; (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we first had total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more (indexed pursuant to the JOBS Act); (3) the date on which we are deemed to be a &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; as defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 (i.e.
 an SEC registered company with a public float of at least $700 million that satisfies other tests); or (4) the date on which we have
 within the previous three years
 issued more than $1 billion of nonconvertible debt.&#160;&#160;Under the JOBS Act
 emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies.&#160;&#160;However
 we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and
 therefore
 we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.


Additionally
 we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we rely on these exemptions.&#160;&#160;If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our reduced disclosures
 there may be less active trading in our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.


&#160;&#160;Under the tax matters agreement that we have entered into with Leucadia
 we covenant not to take actions that would jeopardize the tax-free nature of the Distribution.&#160;&#160;Additionally
 we are required to indemnify Leucadia and its affiliates against all tax-related liabilities caused by the failure of the Distribution to qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes (including as a result of events subsequent to the Distribution that caused Leucadia to recognize gain under Section 355(e) of the Code) to the extent these liabilities arise as a result of actions taken by us or our affiliates (other than Leucadia) or as a result of changes in ownership of our Common Stock.&#160;&#160;If the Distribution is taxable to Leucadia
 Leucadia would recognize gain
 if any
 equal to the difference between Leucadia&#8217;s tax basis in our Common Stock distributed in the distribution and the fair market value of our Common Stock.&#160;&#160;Leucadia does not expect that there would be significant gain
 if any
 recognized on the Distribution even if it were found to be taxable.&#160;&#160;This covenant (and
 to some extent
 this indemnification obligation) may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions
 including being acquired in a transaction for cash consideration or from engaging in certain tax-free combinations in which our shareholders do not ultimately possess a majority ownership interest in the combined entity.


















As of March 19
 2013
 the significant stockholders of our company are our Chairman
 Ian M. Cumming (approximately 8.7% beneficial ownership
 including ownership by certain family members
 but excluding Mr. Cumming&#8217;s charitable foundation) and one of our directors
 Joseph S. Steinberg (approximately 9.6% beneficial ownership
 including ownership by trusts for the benefit of his respective family members
 but excluding Mr. Steinberg&#8217;s private charitable foundation).&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 Messrs. Cumming and Steinberg could exert significant influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders
 including the election or removal of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions.











Crimson&#8217;s vineyards and winemaking facilities are described in Item 1.&#160;&#160;Included at the owned Pine Ridge Vineyards winemaking facility are approximately 9
000 square feet of executive and administrative offices.





From time to time
 Crimson may be involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business.&#160;&#160;Crimson is not currently involved in any legal or administrative proceedings individually or together that it believes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on its business
 results of operations or financial condition.

 there were 1
918 stockholders of record.&#160;&#160;No dividends have been paid since the Distribution.&#160;&#160;The Company does not have a regular dividend policy and whether or not to pay dividends will be determined each year by our board of directors.&#160;&#160;The payment of dividends will also be subject to the terms and covenants contained in the Company&#8217;s revolving credit facility.





As of the last fiscal year end
 the Company had not authorized any securities for issuance under any equity plans.





The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have NOLs and other tax attributes
 the amount and availability of which are subject to certain qualifications
 limitations and uncertainties.&#160;&#160;In order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could result in limitations on the use of its tax attributes
 the Company's certificate of incorporation contains provisions which generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from acquiring ownership (including through attribution under the tax law) of five percent or more of the common stock and the ability of persons or entities now owning five percent or more of the common stock from acquiring additional common stock.&#160;&#160;The restrictions will remain in effect until the earliest of (a) December 31
 2022
 (b) the repeal of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (or any comparable successor provision) and (c) the beginning of a taxable year of the Company to which certain tax benefits may no longer be carried forward.


The transfer agent for the Company&#8217;s common stock is American Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company

After the Distribution
 there were 24
458
368 common shares outstanding.&#160;&#160;As appropriate
 amounts presented in this Report give retroactive effect to the Distribution for all periods presented
 including net income (loss) per share
 book value per share and shares outstanding.&#160;&#160;Both before and after the Distribution
 there were no dilutive or complex equity instruments or securities outstanding at any time.








The following unaudited pro forma financial data for the year ended December 31
 2012 have been prepared to reflect changes to shares outstanding and contributions to capital of the due to Leucadia and its affiliates balance that occurred prior to the Distribution
 and $14
175
000 in cash that occurred after the Distribution (in thousands
 except per share amounts):

















192
191




















Pro forma equity reflects the contribution to capital of $14
175
000 in cash and of the due to Leucadia and its affiliates balance as of December 31
 2012.



















The purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial condition
 liquidity and capital resources and results of operations.&#160;&#160;This analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
 related footnote disclosures and &#8220;Cautionary Statements for Forward-Looking Information
&#8221; which appear elsewhere in this Report.
























Crimson&#8217;s principal sources of liquidity are its available cash
 funds generated from operations and its revolving bank credit facility.&#160;&#160;In March 2013
 Crimson entered into a $60
000
000 revolving credit facility with American AgCredit
 FLCA and CoBank
 FCB as joint lenders
 comprised of an A facility and a B facility
 which together is secured by substantially all of Crimson&#8217;s assets.&#160;&#160;Revolving credit facility A is for up to $10
000
000 of availability for a 5 year term
 collateralized by accounts receivable
 inventory and intangibles. Term revolving credit facility B is for up to $50
000
000
 collateralized by real property
 including vineyards and certain winery facilities of Crimson.&#160;&#160;Covenants include the maintenance of specified debt and equity ratios
 limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness
 limitations on dividends and other distributions to shareholders and restrictions on certain mergers
 consolidations and sales of assets.&#160;&#160;In addition to commitment fees ranging from 0.25% to 0.375%
 rates for the borrowings are priced based on a performance grid tied to certain financial ratios.&#160;&#160;The facility can be used to fund acquisitions and working capital requirements; no amounts are currently outstanding.


Prior to the Distribution
 Crimson relied upon Leucadia for debt financing and equity contributions for all of its liquidity needs
 including $86
018
000 for the acquisition of Seghesio Family Vineyards in May 2011.&#160;&#160;As of December 31
 2012
 the aggregate amount payable by Crimson to Leucadia and its affiliates was $152
183
000
 all of which was contributed to capital before the Distribution. As a result
 in future periods Crimson will not record interest expense relating to this borrowing.&#160;&#160;Crimson&#8217;s positive cash flows from operating activities have improved during the last three years as a result of growth through winery acquisitions
 increased sales from new product launches
 improved brand recognition of its existing portfolio and increased higher margin direct to consumer sales.&#160;&#160;Crimson&#8217;s ability to continue to grow and generate increasing cash flows from operating activities is not certain.


In March 2013
 pursuant to the separation agreement entered into with Leucadia
 Leucadia paid $14
175
000 to Crimson as a capital contribution.&#160;&#160;No additional capital contributions from Leucadia will be made.


As of December 31
 2012
 Crimson&#8217;s commitments for capital expenditures were not material.&#160;&#160;Crimson expects to spend approximating $6
000
000 for capital expenditures during 2013
 of which $2
000
000 is for the expansion of the Seghesio Family Vineyards fermentation and processing capacity and $300
000 for the increase in Chamisal Vineyard&#8217;s permitted capacity.&#160;&#160;These expenditures are focused on expanding and improving our facilities for additional growth
 and do not relate to required maintenance or similar costs to sustain our existing operations.&#160;&#160;The remaining $3
700
000 is for vineyard development
 barrel purchases and other winery and facility improvements.&#160;&#160;Crimson expects to use its available cash and cash flows generated from operating activities to fund its capital expenditures.





Net cash provided by operating activities was $6
982
000
 $4
998
000 and $2
017
000 for the years ended December 31
 2012
 2011 and 2010
 respectively.&#160;&#160;Although operating results improved significantly in 2012 as compared to 2011
 cash flows from operating activities did not increase to the same extent
 due to the timing of the payment of grape purchase payables
 most significantly at Seghesio Family Vineyards
 a larger than expected 2012 harvest and expenditures to support growth for various Crimson brands.&#160;&#160;Seghesio Family Vineyards
 which was acquired in May 2011
 entered into grape purchase agreements for delivery during the 2011 harvest
 some of which did not require payment until 2012.&#160;&#160;While this had a positive impact on 2011 annual cash flows from operating activities
 the payments required in 2012 under these agreements
 along with those for other Crimson brands
 had a corresponding negative impact on cash flows from operating activities aggregating $1
800
000 during 2012.&#160;&#160;Operating cash flows also reflect funds used for increased investment in inventory of $4
105
000
 $1
389
000 and $205
000 during 2012
 2011 and 2010
 respectively
 necessary for the growth of Crimson&#8217;s business.


Cash flows from operating activities also reflect interest paid to Leucadia.&#160;&#160;Interest paid to Leucadia was $1
500
000
 $972
000 and $1
383
000 during 2012
 2011 and 2010
 respectively.


Net cash used for investing activities was $3
909
000
 $89
156
000 and $877
000 for the years ended December 31
 2012
 2011 and 2010
 respectively. Acquisition of property
 equipment and leasehold improvements increased in 2012 and 2011
 principally due to capital expenditures at Seghesio Family Vineyards.&#160;&#160;Proceeds from disposals of property and equipment include $1
386
000 in 2010 from the sale of a non-strategic vineyard and sales of used barrels during all years.


















Net cash used for investing activities during 2011 also reflects $86

The estimated interest expense on debt includes interest related to variable rate debt which Crimson determined using rates in effect at December 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;As discussed above
 all of the amounts due to Leucadia and its affiliates in the table above were contributed to capital prior to the Distribution.







Crimson&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements
 which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;).&#160;&#160;The preparation of these financial statements requires Crimson to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.&#160;&#160;On an on-going basis
 Crimson evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions.&#160;&#160;The following areas have been identified as critical accounting estimates because they have the potential to have a significant impact on Crimson&#8217;s financial statements
 and because they are based on assumptions that are used in the accounting records to reflect
 at a specific point in time
 events whose ultimate outcome won&#8217;t be known until a later date.&#160;&#160;Actual results could differ from these estimates.

&#8212;Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market
 with cost being determined on the first-in
 first-out method.&#160;&#160;Costs associated with winemaking
 and other costs associated with the manufacturing of products for resale
 are recorded as inventory.&#160;&#160;In accordance with general practice within the wine industry
 wine inventories are included in current assets
 although a portion of such inventories may be aged for periods longer than one year.&#160;&#160;As required
 Crimson reduces the carrying value of inventories that are obsolete or in excess of estimated usage to estimated net realizable value.&#160;&#160;Crimson&#8217;s estimates of net realizable value are based on analyses and assumptions including
 but not limited to
 historical usage
 future demand and market requirements.&#160;&#160;Reductions to the carrying value of inventories are recorded in cost of sales.&#160;&#160;If future demand and/or pricing for Crimson&#8217;s products are less than previously estimated
 then the carrying value of the inventories may be required to be reduced
 resulting in additional expense and reduced profitability.&#160;&#160;Inventory write-downs of $50
000
 $51
000 and $1
513
000 were recorded during 2012
 2011 and 2010
 respectively.

&#8212;Crimson capitalizes internal vineyard development costs when developing new vineyards or replacing or improving existing vineyards.&#160;&#160;These costs consist primarily of the costs of the vines and expenditures related to labor and materials to prepare the land and construct vine trellises.&#160;&#160;Amortization of such costs as annual crop costs is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful life of the vineyard
 which can be as long as 25 years.&#160;&#160;As circumstances warrant
 Crimson re-evaluates the recoverability of capitalized costs
 and will record impairment charges if required.&#160;&#160;Crimson has not recorded any significant impairment charges for its vineyards during the last three years.




















&#8212;For intangible assets with definite lives
 impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.&#160;&#160;For intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill
 impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired.&#160;&#160;Crimson currently has no intangible assets with indefinite lives.&#160;&#160;Substantially all of Crimson&#8217;s goodwill and other intangible assets result from the acquisition of Seghesio Family Vineyards in May 2011.&#160;&#160;Amortization of intangible assets is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets
 which range from 7 to 17 years.&#160;&#160;Crimson evaluates goodwill for impairment at the end of each year
 and has concluded that goodwill is not impaired.

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable.&#160;&#160;Long-lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment.&#160;&#160;Circumstances that might cause the Company to evaluate its long-lived assets for impairment could include a significant decline in the prices the Company or the industry can charge for its products
 which could be caused by general economic or other factors
 changes in laws or regulations that make it difficult or more costly for the Company to distribute its products to its markets at prices which generate adequate returns
 natural disasters
 significant decrease in the demand for the Company&#8217;s products or significant increases in the costs to manufacture the Company&#8217;s products.


Recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group.&#160;&#160;If such assets are considered to be impaired
 the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.&#160;&#160;The Company groups its long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (or asset group).&#160;&#160;This would typically be at the winery level which is described above.

The Company did not recognize any impairment charges associated with long-lived assets during the three year period ended December 31
 2012.

&#8212;Crimson pays depletion allowances to its distributors based on their sales to their customers.&#160;&#160;These allowances are set on a monthly basis by Crimson
 and estimated allowances are accrued as a reduction of revenues.&#160;&#160;Subsequently
 distributors will bill Crimson for actual depletions
 which may be different from Crimson&#8217;s estimate.&#160;&#160;Any such differences are recognized in revenues when the bill is received.&#160;&#160;Crimson has historically been able to accurately estimate depletion allowances.





The Company generates revenues from sales of wine to wholesalers and direct to consumers
 sales of bulk wine and grapes
 special event fees
 tasting fees and retail sales.&#160;&#160;Revenues and gross profit for the years ended December 31
 2012

Crimson&#8217;s wines are primarily sold to distributors
 who then sell to retailers and restaurants.&#160;&#160;As permitted under federal and local regulations
 Crimson has also been placing increased emphasis on generating revenue from direct sales to consumers which occur through wine clubs
 at the wineries&#8217; tasting rooms and through the internet.&#160;&#160;Direct sales to consumers are more profitable for Crimson as it is able to sell its products at a price closer to retail prices rather than the wholesale price received from distributors.&#160;&#160;From time to time Crimson may sell grapes or bulk wine
 because the wine does not meet the quality standards for Crimson&#8217;s products
 market conditions have changed resulting in reduced demand for certain products
 or because Crimson may have produced too much of a particular varietal than it can use.&#160;&#160;When these sales occur they may result in a loss.


















Cost of sales includes grape and bulk wine costs
 whether purchased or produced from Crimson&#8217;s controlled vineyards
 crush costs
 winemaking and processing costs
 bottling
 packaging
 warehousing and shipping and handling costs.&#160;&#160;For vineyard produced grapes
 grape costs include annual farming costs and amortization of vineyard development expenditures.&#160;&#160;For wines that age longer than one year
 winemaking and processing costs continue to be incurred and capitalized to the cost of wine
 which can range from 3 to 24 months.&#160;&#160;Reductions to the carrying value of inventories to estimated net realizable value are also included in costs of sales.


At December 31
 2012
 wine inventory includes approximately 689
000 cases of bottled and bulk wine in various stages of the aging process.&#160;&#160;Case wine is expected to be sold over the next 12 to 24 months and generally before the release date of the next vintage.





Revenues and gross profit increased in 2012 as compared to 2011
 principally due to the acquisition of Seghesio Family Vineyards in May 2011.&#160;&#160;Revenues from Seghesio Family Vineyards were $20
074
000 in 2012 and $9
899
000 in 2011.&#160;&#160;Revenues from Pine Ridge brands declined $604
000 primarily due to a private label wine sold during the first six months of 2011 which was not repeated in 2012.&#160;&#160;Archery Summit sales were $123
000 lower in 2012 attributable to a decrease in both wholesale sales and direct to consumer sales.&#160;&#160;These decreases were partially offset by a $463
000 increase in sales for Chamisal Vineyards
 which had growth in both wholesale and direct to consumer sales.&#160;&#160;The remaining change in revenues resulted from reduced sales of bulk wine of $605
000 and increased non-wine revenue of $162
000.


Revenues were $39
306
000 in 2011 and $23
762
000 in 2010. Revenues and gross profit increased in 2011 as compared to 2010
 principally due to the acquisition of Seghesio Family Vineyards
 and revenues from other Crimson products increased by $5
645
000 in 2011.&#160;&#160;Excluding Seghesio Family Vineyards
 revenues reflect an increase in sales of Pine Ridge Chenin Blanc+Viognier of $1
812
000
 an increase in sales at Chamisal Vineyards of $1
162
000
 revenue from the sale of a private label wine in 2011 of $942
000
 and volume growth in all other brands except for Archery Summit
 which had slower wine club sales in 2011.


Gross profit related to Seghesio Family Vineyards was $10
694
000 in 2012 and $3
601
000 in 2011.&#160;&#160;Excluding Seghesio Family Vineyards
 gross profit increased $1
136
000 in 2012 reflecting an increase in case wine sales as well as lower cost of goods sold per case for comparable brands.&#160;&#160;In addition to changes in revenues
 gross profit also reflects net losses on sales of bulk wine and grapes of $467
000
 $395
000 and $332
000 for the years ended December 31
 2012
 2011 and 2010
 respectively
 and losses from inventory write-downs as reflected in the table above.&#160;&#160;The large inventory write-down in 2010 principally resulted from the declassification of wine intended for higher priced luxury wine programs.&#160;&#160;This wine was eventually sold as bulk wine
 under the new ForeFront by Pine Ridge program and under private label programs.


Sales and marketing expenses related to Seghesio Family Vineyards were $2
291
000 in 2012 and $1
580
000 in 2011.&#160;&#160;Crimson&#8217;s sales and marketing expenses have a fixed component and a variable component that tends to correspond to changes in sales volume.&#160;&#160;Excluding Seghesio Family Vineyards
 sales and marketing expenses increased $1
461
000 in 2012
 of which $286
000 resulted from variable cost increases and $1
175
000 from fixed cost increases.&#160;&#160;Variable cost increases resulted from increased costs for promotions
 distributor samples and events and direct to consumer events
 partially offset by decreases in distributor commissions and credit card fees in proportion to volume.&#160;&#160;Fixed sales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to increased overhead costs of $918
000 necessary for business expansion
 increased insurance costs of $47
000 and increased marketing costs related to packaging and collateral of $162
000.


Excluding Seghesio Family Vineyards
 sales and marketing expenses increased $1
226
000 in 2011 as compared to 2010
 of which $388
000 resulted from variable cost increases and $838
000 from fixed cost increases.&#160;&#160;Variable cost increases resulted from increased costs of $308
000 for distributor commissions
 incentives
 and national sales promotions and $73
000 for marketing design
 photography and special events.&#160;&#160;Fixed costs increases resulted from increased compensation for the expansion of the sales force given the larger product portfolio and anticipated growth.


General and administrative expenses related to Seghesio Family Vineyards were $2
585
000 in 2012 and $2
276
000 in 2011.&#160;&#160;Excluding Seghesio Family Vineyards
 general and administrative expenses increased $260
000 in 2012
 principally due to a $243
000 increase in payroll related expense
 $65
000 of higher recruiting fees and $46
000 in legal fees primarily related to label litigation that resulted in a favorable outcome
 partially offset by a $53
000 reduction in bad debt expense and a $51
000 reduction in repair and maintenance expense.&#160;&#160;Excluding Seghesio Family Vineyards
 general and administrative expenses increased $946
000 in 2011 as compared to 2010
 primarily due to a $662
000 increase in compensation
 $74
000 of additional bad debt expense
 $58
000 increased accounting fees and $56
000 in increased recruiting costs coinciding with growth expectations.


















Interest expense reflects the costs of funds borrowed from Leucadia
 which funds were contributed to capital prior to the Distribution.


Historically
 Crimson has been included in the consolidated federal income tax return of Leucadia and filed a California state income tax separate from Leucadia. Crimson has not recorded a federal or state income tax benefit for its pre-tax losses
 as sufficient evidence does not exist to enable Crimson to conclude that it is more likely than not that it can generate sufficient taxable income in the future to realize such benefits.&#160;&#160;As a result
 Crimson recorded a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset
 which is the primary reason for the difference between the effective income tax rate and the federal statutory rate for all periods presented.&#160;&#160;For the year ended December 31
 2012
 the income tax provision reflected $11
000 for California and Oregon state income tax.&#160;&#160;Prior to 2012
 Crimson paid California and Oregon state minimum income taxes aggregating $2
800 per year.




Crimson does not currently have any exposure to financial market risk.&#160;&#160;Sales to international customers are denominated in U.S. dollars; therefore
 Crimson is not exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.&#160;&#160;Prior to the Distribution
 Crimson did not have any significant outstanding debt instruments other than amounts due to Leucadia; therefore
 Crimson was not exposed to market risk relating to interest rates.&#160;&#160;As discussed above under Liquidity and Capital Resources
 Crimson has recently entered into a revolving credit facility.&#160;&#160;Any amount borrowed is expected to bear interest at floating rates.

















The Company's management evaluated
 with the participation of the Company's principal executive and principal financial officers
 the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;))
 as of December 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;Based on their evaluation
 the Company's principal executive and principal financial officers concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31
 2012.


This Report does not include a report of management's assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of the company's registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission for newly public companies.&#160;&#160;In addition
 for so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act
 our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.


There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Company's fiscal quarter ended December 31
 2012
 that has materially affected
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect
 the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

 we are not subject to listing standards that would require us to have a compensation committee or that would require director nominees to be selected or recommended by a majority of independent directors or a nominating committee comprised solely of independent directors.&#160;&#160;The Board believes it is appropriate to have all directors involved in setting executive and director compensation and in the process of nominating directors
 rather than delegate these responsibilities to a smaller group of directors.&#160;&#160;As indicated below
 under the listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market
 Messrs. Carlson
 Neikrug and Williams are independent directors serving on the Board.&#160;&#160;The Company will continue to evaluate the need for a compensation committee and a nominating committee in the future.





A stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors may nominate one or more persons for election as director at a meeting if written notice of that stockholder&#8217;s intent to make the nomination has been given to us
 with respect to an election to be held at an annual meeting of stockholders
 no earlier than 150 days and no later than 120 days before the first anniversary of our proxy statement in connection with the last annual meeting
 and
 with respect to an election to be held at a special meeting of stockholders
 no earlier than 150 days before such special meeting and no later than 120 days before such special meeting
 or if the first public notice of such special meeting is less than 130 days prior to the date of such special meeting
 the tenth day following the date on which public notice of the meeting is first given to stockholders.&#160;&#160;&#160;The notice shall provide such information as required under the Company&#8217;s By-laws
 including
 without limitation
 the name and address of the stockholder and his or her nominees
 a representation that the stockholder is entitled to vote at the meeting and intends to nominate the person
 a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee
 other information as would be required to be included in a proxy statement soliciting proxies for the election of the stockholder&#8217;s nominees
 the consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the Company if so elected
 information concerning the stockholder&#8217;s direct and indirect ownership of securities of the Company
 including with respect to any beneficial owner of securities of the Company held by the stockholder
 and compensation received by or relationships between such stockholder with respect to the securities of the Company from any beneficial owner of such securities.&#160;&#160;We may require any proposed nominee to furnish other information as we may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of the proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Company.



















The Board of Directors has adopted a charter for the Audit Committee
 which is available on our website
 www.crimsonwinegroup.com.&#160;&#160;The Audit Committee consists of Mr. Carlson
 who will serve as the Chairman
 and Mr. Neikrug.&#160;&#160;The Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Carlson is qualified as an audit committee financial expert within the meaning of regulations of the SEC and that each of Mr. Carlson and Mr. Neikrug is independent applying the NASDAQ Stock Market&#8217;s listing standards for independence and the SEC&#8217;s independence requirements for audit committee members.





Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our executive officers and directors
 and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities
 to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC.&#160;&#160;Based solely upon a review of the copies of such forms furnished to us and written representations from our executive officers
 directors and greater than 10% beneficial stockholders
 we believe that all persons subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) filed the required reports on a timely basis.





We have a Code of Business Practice
 which is applicable to all of our directors
 officers and employees
 and includes a Code of Practice applicable to our principal executive officers and senior financial officers.&#160;&#160;Both the Code of Business Practice and the Code of Practice are available on our website.&#160;&#160;We intend to post amendments to or waivers from our Code of Practice on our website as required by applicable law.







During 2012
 the Company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Leucadia and did not have a Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.&#160;&#160;As previously stated
 the Board does not have a standing compensation committee and
 as a result
 the Board of Directors in its entirety will perform such functions as would otherwise be performed by a compensation committee.&#160;&#160;The Company believes that given the Company&#8217;s recent status as an independent public company
 it is appropriate for all directors to be involved in the compensation process; however
 the Board will continue to evaluate the desirability of forming a compensation committee in the future.





We do not have a formal stock ownership requirement
 although two of our directors
 Mr. Steinberg and Mr. Cumming
 respectively
 beneficially own approximately 9.6% and 8.7% of our outstanding common stock.





The Company does not currently provide share-based compensation to employees or directors.&#160;&#160;In the future
 if share-based compensation is provided to employees or directors
 the cost of such share-based compensation would be recognized in the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on their fair values at the time of grant and would be recognized as an expense over the vesting period of any such award in accordance with GAAP.

All other compensation represents 401(k) contributions for Mr. Martin and DeLong and for Mr. Cekay a car allowance of $1
400 per month.



&#160;&#160;On June 27
 2007
 we entered into an agreement with Mr. DeLong.&#160;&#160;The agreement continues until terminated by us or Mr. DeLong
 or due to his death or disability which renders him unable to perform his duties under the agreement for 90 consecutive days in any 12-month period.&#160;&#160;Mr. DeLong&#8217;s annual base salary under the agreement was $225
000 per year.&#160;&#160;On March 1
 2012
 Mr. DeLong&#8217;s annual base salary was increased to $275
000 per year.&#160;&#160;Mr. DeLong is entitled to an annual bonus opportunity based on performance goals established by us and Mr. DeLong at the beginning of each calendar year.&#160;&#160;Mr. DeLong&#8217;s target bonus was 40% of his annual base salary for the first full calendar year
 45% for the second full calendar year and 50% for the third full calendar year and subsequent calendar years. We will notify Mr. DeLong if the bonus target becomes different than 50% of his base salary.&#160;&#160;Notwithstanding the provisions of the agreement
 the board of directors may make a determination as to bonus payable to Mr. DeLong in its discretion.&#160;&#160;Pursuant to the agreement
 Mr. DeLong is also eligible to participate in and receive any stock option grants and to participate in any standard company benefits.&#160;&#160;Mr. DeLong is also eligible to share a percentage of our pre-tax income
 subject to terms determined by us pursuant to any long-term incentive or deferred compensation program.&#160;&#160;Mr. DeLong is entitled to certain benefits if his employment is terminated or upon other events.&#160;&#160;See &#8220;Potential Payments on Termination or Change of Control&#8221; below.

. On March 26
 2012
 we entered into an agreement with Mr. Cekay.&#160;&#160;The agreement continues until terminated by us or Mr. Cekay at any time and for any reason or for no reason with or without notice.&#160;&#160;Mr. Cekay&#8217;s annual base salary under the agreement is $275
000 per year.&#160;&#160;Mr. Cekay is eligible for an annual bonus in an amount to be determined by us in our discretion up to 30% bonus target of base salary plus an accelerator
 based on sales contribution as compared to target
 to be determined annually.&#160;&#160;The amount of any annual bonus will be based upon our performance and Mr. Cekay&#8217;s performance
 as determined by us
 against goals mutually agreed upon between Mr. Cekay and us.&#160;&#160;Pursuant to the agreement
 Mr. Cekay is also eligible to participate in a long term incentive plan
 receive a car allowance benefit of $1
400 per month and participate in standard company benefits.&#160;&#160;Mr. Cekay is not entitled to any benefits if his employment is terminated or upon other events.





The information below describes and quantifies certain compensation that would become payable under each named executive officer&#8217;s employment agreement if
 as of December 31
 2012
 his employment had been terminated (including termination in connection with a change in control).&#160;&#160;Due to the number of factors that affect the nature and amount of any benefits provided upon the events discussed below
 any actual amounts paid or distributed may be different.&#160;&#160;Factors that could affect these amounts include the timing during the year of any such event.


&#160;&#160;In the event Mr. DeLong&#8217;s employment is terminated by us without cause
 by him with good reason or by a successor (whether direct
 indirect
 by purchase
 merger
 consolidation or otherwise) before a change in control
 he shall be entitled to continue to receive as severance
 payment
 in accordance with our current payroll practices
 of his base salary in effect at the time of termination for 12 months.






















Mr. Cumming
 our only director during 2012
 did not receive any compensation for his service to us in the year ended December 31
 2012.&#160;&#160;As approved in March 2013
 our non-employee directors will receive an annual retainer of $25
000 for serving on the Board of Directors and a per meeting fee of $2
500 for each Board or committee meeting attended in person.&#160;&#160;Mr. Carlson will receive an additional $26
000 annually for serving as Chairman of the Audit Committee
 and Mr. Neikrug will receive an additional $17
000 annually for serving on the Audit Committee.&#160;&#160;The Company reimburses directors for reasonable travel expenses incurred in attending board and committee meetings.





The Company does not have a formal compensation plan for any of its employees.&#160;&#160;Annually
 the Board of Directors will consider making incentive compensation awards that are purely discretionary
 taking into account the employee&#8217;s individual performance as well as the Company&#8217;s performance for the particular year.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 the Company believes that its compensation policies do not reward employees for imprudent risk taking.







In connection with the Distribution
 our Board of Directors adopted an equity compensation plan
 which allows the Company to grant incentive stock options
 nonqualified stock options
 stock appreciation rights
 restricted stock
 and other stock-based awards
 and performance-based compensation awards to its officers
 employees
 and non-employee directors.&#160;&#160;The equity compensation plan will be administered by our compensation committee
 which is authorized to select the officers
 employees and non-employee directors to whom awards will be granted
 and to determine the type and amount of such awards.&#160;&#160;The maximum number of shares available for issuance under the plan is 1 million.&#160;&#160;To the extent permitted by Section 162(m) of the Code
 our compensation committee is authorized to design any award so that the amounts or shares payable or distributed pursuant to such award will be treated as &#8220;qualified performance-based compensation&#8221; within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code and related regulations.&#160;&#160;The equity compensation plan was filed as an Exhibit to the Company&#8217;s Form 8K
 filed on February 1
 2013.&#160;&#160;This summary of the plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the plan.

As of March 19
 2013
 Cede &amp; Co. held of record 19
781
887 shares of our common stock (approximately 80.9% of our total common stock outstanding).&#160;&#160;Cede &amp; Co. held such shares as a nominee for broker-dealer members of The Depository Trust Company
 which conducts clearing and settlement operations for securities transactions involving its members.


As described herein
 our common stock is subject to transfer restrictions that are designed to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could result in limitations on the use of our tax attributes.&#160;&#160;Our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from acquiring ownership (including through attribution under the tax law) of 5% or more of our common shares and the ability of persons or entities now owning 5% or more of our common shares from acquiring additional common shares.&#160;&#160;Stockholders (and prospective stockholders) are advised that
 under the tax law rules incorporated in these provisions
 the acquisition of even a single share of common stock may be proscribed under our certificate of incorporation
 given (among other things) the tax law ownership attribution rules as well as the tax law rules applicable to acquisitions made in coordination with or in concert with others.&#160;&#160;The restriction will remain until the earliest of (a) December 31
 2022
 (b) the repeal of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (or any comparable successor provision) and (c) the beginning of our taxable year to which these tax attributes may no longer be carried forward.&#160;&#160;The restriction may be waived by our Board of Directors.


Stockholders are advised to carefully monitor their ownership of our common stock and consult their own legal advisors and/or us to determine whether their ownership of our common shares approaches the proscribed level.&#160;&#160;Based upon discussions with Fairholme
 we believe that the beneficial ownership (determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) by Fairholme of our common stock as reflected in the table above is not in violation of the transfer restrictions contained in our certificate of incorporation.























The Board has adopted a policy for the review
 approval and ratification of transactions that involve &#8220;related persons&#8221; and potential conflicts of interest (the &#8220;Related Person Transaction Policy&#8221;).

The Related Person Transaction Policy applies to each director and executive officer of the Company
 any nominee for election as a director of the Company
 any security holder who is known to own of record or beneficially more than five percent of any class of the Company&#8217;s voting securities
 any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons
 and any corporation
 firm
 association or other entity in which one or more directors of the Company are directors or officers
 or have a substantial financial interest (each a &#8220;Related Person&#8221;).

Under the Related Person Transaction Policy
 a Related Person Transaction is defined as a transaction or arrangement involving a Related Person in which the Company is a participant or that would require disclosure in the Company&#8217;s filings in accordance with SEC rules.

Under the Related Person Transaction Policy
 Related Persons must disclose to the Audit Committee any potential Related Person Transactions and must disclose all material facts with respect to such transaction.&#160;&#160;All Related Person Transactions will be reviewed by the Audit Committee and
 in its discretion
 approved or ratified.&#160;&#160;In determining whether to approve or ratify a Related Person Transaction the Audit Committee will consider the relevant facts and circumstances of the Related Person Transaction
 which may include factors such as the relationship of the Related Person with the Company
 the materiality or significance of the transaction to the Company and the Related Person
 the business purpose and reasonableness of the transaction
 whether the transaction is comparable to a transaction that could be available to the Company on an arms-length basis
 and the impact of the transaction on the Company&#8217;s business and operations.

From time to time
 our directors and officers may engage in purchases of our products at substantial discounts (but not below cost) as determined to be reasonable under the circumstances.&#160;&#160;Generally
 we do not believe any such transactions to be material to the Company or the related person and do not believe that any such transactions would impair the independence of any director.&#160;&#160;The Board has considered these possible purchases under the Related Person Transaction Policy and has determined that no such purchase will require prior approval by the Audit Committee.





Following the Distribution
 Crimson and Leucadia have operated their businesses separately
 each as an independent company.&#160;&#160;We have entered into certain agreements with Leucadia that are described below.





The separation agreement provides for the allocation among the parties of rights and obligations under existing insurance policies with respect to occurrences prior to the separation and sets forth procedures for the administration of insured claims.&#160;&#160;In addition
 the separation agreement allocates between the parties the right to proceeds and the obligation to incur certain deductibles under certain insurance policies.&#160;&#160;Leucadia is required
 subject to the terms of the agreement
 to obtain certain directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; insurance policies to apply against pre-separation claims.


Other matters governed by the separation agreement include
 among others
 access to financial and other records and information
 intellectual property
 legal privilege
 confidentiality
 access to and provision of records and treatment of outstanding guarantees.





We and Leucadia have entered into an administrative services agreement whereby Leucadia or its subsidiaries provide to us certain administrative services.&#160;&#160;The services that Leucadia provides to us include SEC and tax filing services
 and the fees are intended to allow Leucadia to fully recover the costs directly associated with providing the services
 plus out-of-pocket costs and expenses.&#160;&#160;We may terminate certain specified services by giving prior written notice to Leucadia of any such termination.&#160;&#160;The administrative services agreement has an initial term of one year
 an evergreen renewal for subsequent annual periods and is terminable by either party on six months prior notice.&#160;&#160;The annual fee for these services is $180
000
 payable in monthly installments of $15
000.





















We and Leucadia have entered into a tax matters agreement which governs the parties&#8217; respective rights
 responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes
 the preparation and filing of tax returns
 the control of audits and other tax proceedings and assistance and cooperation in respect of tax matters (the &#8220;Tax Matters Agreement&#8221;).&#160;&#160;As a former member of Leucadia&#8217;s consolidated U.S. federal income tax group
 we have joint and several liability with Leucadia for the consolidated U.S. federal income taxes of the Leucadia group relating to the taxable periods in which we were part of the group.&#160;&#160;Under the Tax Matters Agreement
 however
 Leucadia has agreed to indemnify us against this liability and any similar liability for U.S.
 state or local income taxes that are determined on a consolidated
 combined
 unitary or similar basis for each taxable period in which we are included in such consolidated
 combined
 unitary or similar group with Leucadia.&#160;&#160;We remain responsible for any income taxes that are not determined on a consolidated
 combined
 unitary or similar basis with Leucadia.


Under the Tax Matters Agreement
 we have agreed not to take actions that would jeopardize the tax-free nature of the Distribution.&#160;&#160;The Tax Matters Agreement also provides rules for allocating tax liabilities in the event that the Distribution is not tax-free.&#160;&#160;We agreed to indemnify Leucadia for such tax liabilities that are attributable to the failure of certain representations made by us or our affiliates to be true when made
 certain actions by us or our affiliates or changes in ownership of our common stock.


Our obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement are not contractually limited in amount or subject to any cap.&#160;&#160;Further
 even if we are not responsible for tax liabilities of Leucadia and its subsidiaries under the Tax Matters Agreement
 we nonetheless could be liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities if Leucadia were to fail to pay them or to indemnify us under the Tax Matters Agreement.





Amounts due to Leucadia and its affiliates were $152
183
000
 $151
441
000 and $103
421
000 as of December 31
 2012
 2011 and 2010
 respectively.&#160;&#160;Amounts due to Leucadia and its affiliates bear interest at a specified bank prime rate plus 0.125%.&#160;&#160;All amounts were payable on demand
 except for the $45
000
000 note issued to Leucadia in connection with the acquisition of Seghesio Family Vineyards that was due May 13
 2013.&#160;&#160;Unpaid interest
 if any
 was added to the principal balance on a quarterly basis.&#160;&#160;Prior to the Distribution
 the remaining balance due to Leucadia and its affiliates was contributed to capital.&#160;&#160;Interest expense to affiliates was $5
192
000
 $4
494
000 and $3
470
000 for the years ended December 31
 2012
 2011 and 2010
 respectively.





The Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Neikrug
 Mr. Carlson and Mr. Williams are independent applying the NASDAQ Stock Market&#8217;s listing standards for independence.





Prior to formation of the Audit Committee
 the Board of Directors adopted a policy for pre-approval by the Audit Committee of all audit and non-audit work performed by the Company&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm
 Moss Adams LLP
 and has pre-approved (i) certain general categories of work where no specific case-by-case approval is necessary (&#8220;general pre-approvals&#8221;) and (ii) categories of work which require the specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee (&#8220;specific pre-approvals&#8221;).&#160;&#160;For additional services or services in an amount above the annual amount that has been pre-approved
 additional authorization from the Audit Committee is required.&#160;&#160;The Audit Committee has delegated to Chairman of the Audit Committee the ability to pre-approve all of these services in the absence of the full committee.&#160;&#160;Any pre-approval decisions made by the Chairman of the Audit Committee under this delegated authority will be reported to the full Audit Committee.&#160;&#160;All requests for services to be provided by Moss Adams LLP that do not require specific approval by the Audit Committee must be submitted to the Chief Financial Officer of the Company
 who determines whether such services are in fact within the scope of those services that have received the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee.&#160;&#160;The Chief Financial Officer reports to the Audit Committee periodically.





In accordance with the SEC&#8217;s definitions and rules
 Audit Fees are fees paid to Moss Adams LLP for professional services for the audit of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements included in the Company&#8217;s Form 10-K

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders ofCrimson Wine Group
 Ltd.We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Crimson Wine Group
 Ltd. and subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;)
 as of December 31
 2012 and 2011
 and the related consolidated statements of operations
 cash flows and changes in equity for the years ended December 31
 2012
 2011 and 2010. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.&#160;&#160;Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
 assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed further in Notes 1
 8
 9 and 15 to the financial statements
 on February 25
 2013
 the Company was spun-off from Leucadia National Corporation (&#8220;Leucadia&#8221;)
 through a distribution of the Company&#8217;s shares to Leucadia shareholders.&#160;&#160;Concurrent with the distribution
 the Company&#8217;s outstanding balance due to Leucadia was contributed to the Company&#8217;s capital.

In our opinion
 the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the consolidated financial position of Crimson Wine Group
 Ltd. and subsidiaries
 as of December 31
 2012 and 2011
 and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the years ended December 31
 2012
 2011 and 2010
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

CRIMSON WINE GROUP
 LTD.















The Crimson Wine Group
 Ltd. (&#8220;Crimson&#8221;) is a Delaware company that has been operating since 1991.&#160;&#160;As used herein
 the term
 &#8220;Company&#8221; refers to Crimson and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
 except as the context may otherwise require.&#160;&#160;Prior to February 25
 2013
 Crimson was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Leucadia National Corporation (&#8220;Leucadia&#8221;).&#160;&#160;On February 1
 2013
 Leucadia declared a pro rata dividend of all of the outstanding shares of Crimson&#8217;s common stock in a manner that was structured to qualify as a tax-free spin-off for U.S. federal income tax purposes (the &#8220;Distribution&#8221;).&#160;&#160;Leucadia&#8217;s common shareholders received one share of Crimson common stock for every ten common shares of Leucadia (24
458
368 Crimson common shares in the aggregate)
 with cash in lieu of fractional shares
 on February 25
 2013.&#160;&#160;The consolidated financial statements and notes thereto give retroactive effect to the Distribution for all periods presented.

Crimson qualifies as an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; as defined in the JOBS Act.&#160;&#160;An emerging growth company is defined as a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion in its most recently completed fiscal year.&#160;&#160;An emerging growth company will retain such status until the earliest of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year of the emerging growth company following the fifth anniversary of the date it first sold securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933; (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which the emerging growth company first had total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more (indexed pursuant to the JOBS Act); (3) the date on which the emerging growth company is deemed to be a &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; as defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 (i.e.
 an SEC registered company with a public float of at least $700 million that satisfies other tests); or (4) the date on which the emerging growth company has
 within the previous three years
 issued more than $1 billion of nonconvertible debt.&#160;&#160;Crimson has elected to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.&#160;&#160;This election is irrevocable.













The Company operates in one segment
 the production and sale of premium
 ultra premium and luxury wines (i.e.
 wines that retail for $10 to $14
 $14 to $25 and over $25 per 750ml bottle
 respectively).&#160;&#160;&#160;Crimson is headquartered in Napa
 California and through its wholly-owned subsidiaries owns four wineries: Pine Ridge Vineyards
 Archery Summit
 Chamisal Vineyards and Seghesio Family Vineyards.&#160;&#160;Pine Ridge was acquired in 1991 and has been conducting operations since 1978
 Archery Summit was started in 1993
 Chamisal Vineyards was acquired during 2008 and has been conducting operations since 1973
 and Seghesio Family Vineyards was acquired in 2011 and has been conducting operations since 1895.&#160;&#160;Additionally
 in 2005 and 2006 Double Canyon Vineyards
 a wholly owned subsidiary
 was acquired
 consisting of an aggregate of 611 acres of land in the Horse Heaven Hills of Washington&#8217;s Columbia Valley
 of which 462 are plantable to vineyards.


Pine Ridge Vineyards owns 156 acres
 which reflects the sale of 12 plantable acres of a non-strategic vineyard in January 2013
 and controls through leasing arrangements an additional 20 acres of estate vineyards in five Napa Valley appellations &#8211; Stags Leap District
 Rutherford
 Oakville
 Carneros and Howell Mountain.&#160;&#160;Approximately 161 acres are currently planted and producing grapes.&#160;&#160;Archery Summit owns 100 acres and controls through leasing arrangements an additional 20 acres of estate vineyards in the Willamette Valley
 Oregon.&#160;&#160;Approximately 110 acres are currently planted and producing grapes.&#160;&#160;Chamisal Vineyards owns 97 acres of vineyards in the Edna Valley
 California
 of which 74 acres are currently planted and producing grapes.&#160;&#160;Seghesio Family Vineyards owns 299 acres of vineyards in two Sonoma County appellations
 the Alexander Valley and Russian River Valley
 of which approximately 267 are currently planted and producing grapes.&#160;&#160;Double Canyon Vineyards owns 462 plantable acres of vineyards in the Horse Heaven Hills
 Washington
 of which 87 acres are currently planted and producing grapes.


































: The Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;).&#160;&#160;The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.&#160;&#160;On an on-going basis
 the Company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions.&#160;&#160;The following areas have been identified as critical accounting estimates because they have the potential to have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements
 and because they are based on assumptions which are used in the accounting records to reflect
 at a specific point in time
 events whose ultimate outcome won&#8217;t be known until a later date.&#160;&#160;Actual results could differ from these estimates.

 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market
 with cost being determined on the first-in
 first-out method.&#160;&#160;Costs associated with winemaking
 and other costs associated with the manufacturing of products for resale
 are recorded as inventory.&#160;&#160;In accordance with general practice within the wine industry
 wine inventories are included in current assets
 although a portion of such inventories may be aged for periods longer than one year.&#160;&#160;As required
 the Company reduces the carrying value of inventories that are obsolete or in excess of estimated usage to estimated net realizable value.&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s estimates of net realizable value are based on analyses and assumptions including
 but not limited to
 historical usage
 future demand and market requirements.&#160;&#160;Reductions to the carrying value of inventories are recorded in cost of sales.&#160;&#160;If future demand and/or pricing for the Company&#8217;s products are less than previously estimated
 then the carrying value of the inventories may be required to be reduced
 resulting in additional expense and reduced profitability.&#160;&#160;Inventory write-downs of $50
000
 $51
000 and $1
513
000 were recorded during 2012
 2011 and 2010
 respectively.


 &#8211; The Company capitalizes internal vineyard development costs when developing new vineyards or replacing or improving existing vineyards.&#160;&#160;These costs consist primarily of the costs of the vines and expenditures related to labor and materials to prepare the land and construct vine trellises.&#160;&#160;Amortization of such costs as annual crop costs is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful life of the vineyard
 which can be as long as 25 years.&#160;&#160;As circumstances warrant
 the Company re-evaluates the recoverability of capitalized costs
 and will record impairment charges if required.&#160;&#160;The Company has not recorded any significant impairment charges for its vineyards during the last three years.


 - For intangible assets with definite lives
 impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.&#160;&#160;For intangible assets with indefinite lives (the Company has no intangible assets with indefinite lives) and for goodwill
 impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired.&#160;&#160;Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s goodwill and other intangible assets result from the acquisition of Seghesio Family Vineyards in May 2011.&#160;&#160;Amortization of intangible assets is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets
 which range from 7 to 17 years.&#160;&#160;The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the end of each year
 and has concluded that goodwill is not impaired.


The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable.&#160;&#160;Long-lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment.&#160;&#160;Circumstances that might cause the Company to evaluate its long-lived assets for impairment could include a significant decline in the prices of the Company or the industry can charge for its product
 which could be caused by general economic or other factors
 changes in laws or regulations that make it difficult or more costly for the Company to distribute its products to its markets at prices which generate adequate returns
 natural disasters
 significant decrease in demand for the Company&#8217;s products or significant increase in the costs to manufacture the Company&#8217;s products.























Recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group.&#160;&#160;If such assets are considered to be impaired
 the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.&#160;&#160;The Company groups its long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (or asset group).&#160;&#160;This would typically be at the winery level which is described in note 2 above.&#160;&#160;The Company did not recognize any impairment charges associated with long-lived assets during the three year period ended December 31
 2012.


 The Company pays depletion allowances to its distributors based on their sales to their customers.&#160;&#160;These allowances are set on a monthly basis by the Company
 and estimated allowances are accrued as a reduction of sales.&#160;&#160;Subsequently
 distributors will bill the Company for actual depletions
 which may be different from the Company&#8217;s estimate.&#160;&#160;Any such differences are recognized in sales when the bill is received.&#160;&#160;The Company has historically been able to accurately estimate depletion allowances.


:&#160;&#160;The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries
 all of which are wholly-owned.&#160;&#160;All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.


:&#160;&#160;The Company considers short-term investments
 which have maturities of less than three months at the time of acquisition
 to be cash equivalents.&#160;&#160;The Company had no short-term investments at December 31
 2012 and 2011.





:&#160;&#160;The Company sells the majority of its wine through distributors and retailers.&#160;&#160;Receivables arising from these sales are not collateralized.&#160;&#160;For the years ended December 31
 2012
 2011 and 2010
 sales to one customer accounted for approximately 14%
 15% and 15% of total sales
 respectively.&#160;&#160;Amounts due from this customer represented approximately 20% and 16% of accounts receivable as of December 31
 2012 and 2011
 respectively.

The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts that
 at times
 may exceed FDIC insurance thresholds.


:&#160;&#160;The Company recognizes revenue from product sales upon shipment or delivery provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 which for sales to wholesalers is a purchase order
 the price is fixed
 title has transferred
 collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured
 there are no customer acceptance requirements
 and there are no remaining significant obligations.&#160;&#160;The cost of depletion allowances and price promotions are treated as reductions of revenues and can be reasonably estimated based upon experience.&#160;&#160;Revenue from products sold through retail locations
 wine clubs and the Internet is recognized when the product is received by the customer and payment is received
 based on published retail prices and applicable published discounts.&#160;&#160;Revenue includes any shipping and handling costs billed to the customer
 and such amounts are not expected to be sufficient to cover actual costs.






















:&#160;&#160;Includes grape
 juice and bulk wine costs
 whether purchased or grown
 crush costs
 winemaking and processing costs
 bottling
 packaging
 warehousing and shipping and handling costs.&#160;&#160;For vineyard produced grapes
 grape costs include annual farming costs and amortization of vineyard development expenditures.&#160;&#160;For wines that age longer than one year
 winemaking and processing costs continue to be incurred and capitalized to the cost of wine
 which can range from 3 to 24 months.


:&#160;&#160;Excise taxes are levied by government agencies on the sale of alcoholic beverages
 including wine.&#160;&#160;These taxes are not collected from customers but are instead the responsibility of the Company.&#160;&#160;Excise taxes of $836
000
 $760
000 and $393
000 in 2012
 2011 and 2010
 respectively
 were recognized as a reduction to wine sales.&#160;&#160;Sales taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to governmental agencies are not reflected as revenues.

:&#160;&#160;Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $81
000
 $82
000 and $65
000 for the years ended December&#160;31
 2012
 2011 and 2010
 respectively.

:&#160;&#160;Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method
 which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements.&#160;&#160;Under this method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.&#160;&#160;The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enacted date.

Net tax assets are recorded to the extent the Company believes these assets will more likely than not be realized.&#160;&#160;In making such determination
 the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence
 including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities
 projected future taxable income
 tax planning strategies and recent financial results of operations.&#160;&#160;The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance related to its net deferred tax asset.&#160;&#160;To the extent the Company concludes that its net deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be realized in the future
 an adjustment to the net deferred tax valuation allowance will be recorded as a credit to income tax expense.


Prior to the Distribution
 the Company and its subsidiaries were included in the consolidated federal and certain consolidated or combined state income tax returns of Leucadia.&#160;&#160;However
 the provisions for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations have been determined on a theoretical separate-return basis.&#160;&#160;The Company does not have any unrecognized tax benefits; however
 if it did the Company would record accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.&#160;&#160;See Note 11 for more information.

: For the years ended December 31
 2012
 2011 and 2010
 the consolidated financial statements include amounts billed by Leucadia for general corporate insurance ($305
000
 $335
000 and $194
000
 respectively)
 and for internal audit procedures related to Leucadia&#8217;s consolidated audit of internal controls over financial reporting ($13
000
 $38
000 and $10
000
 respectively).&#160;&#160;Amounts billed for insurance were determined either by the Company&#8217;s directly determined share of third-party insurance premiums or
 if an allocation of third-party insurance premiums
 based on the Company&#8217;s relative revenues and assets as compared to Leucadia&#8217;s consolidated revenues and consolidated assets.&#160;&#160;Costs related to internal audit services were based on actual hours spent and the internal auditors&#8217; employment and travel costs.&#160;&#160;Subsequent to the Distribution
 the Company became responsible for obtaining its own general corporate insurance policies and internal audit services and expects that these costs in the future will not be significantly different from its historical costs.






















The Company may incur certain new and incremental costs as a stand-alone public company including director fees and expenses for its new board of directors
 stand-alone Delaware franchise tax
 increased legal and accounting fees for reviews for the Company&#8217;s publicly filed financial statements
 proxy and other filings and other services.&#160;&#160;The Company estimates that these costs could be approximately $900
000 or more per year.&#160;&#160;In addition
 the Company entered into an Administrative Services Agreement with Leucadia whereby Leucadia or its subsidiaries provide services principally related to the Company&#8217;s public filings and financial analysis.&#160;&#160;The charges for the administrative services are $180
000 per year
 and allow Leucadia to fully recover the costs directly associated with providing the services
 plus out-of-pocket costs and expenses.&#160;&#160;The Company expects it will eventually perform these services on its own in the future.


:&#160;&#160;Effective January 1
 2012
 the Company adopted new Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) guidance with respect to the improvement of the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements issued in accordance with GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.&#160;&#160;The amendment includes requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements
 but does not require additional fair value measurements and is not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting.&#160;&#160;The guidance did not have any impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.


Effective January 1
 2012
 the Company adopted new FASB guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income.&#160;&#160;This amendment eliminated the previous option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity; instead
 it requires the presentation of comprehensive income
 the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.&#160;&#160;Since the Company has no components of comprehensive income other than net income
 adoption of this amendment did not have any impact on its consolidated financial statements.


Effective January 1
 2012
 the Company adopted new FASB guidance with respect to the simplification of how entities test for goodwill impairment. This amendment permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The guidance did not have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.

In July 2012
 the FASB issued amended guidance for indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing. The amended guidance allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired. If an entity concludes it is not more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired
 the entity is not required to take further action. If an entity concludes otherwise
 then the entity would be required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and compare the fair value with the carrying amount of the indefinite lived intangible asset. The Company is required to adopt this amended guidance for its annual and interim periods beginning January 1
 2013. The Company does not expect the adoption of this amended guidance to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.







































On May 31
 2011
 a subsidiary of the Company acquired all of the assets and operations of Seghesio Winery
 Inc.
 Seghesio Farms
 Inc. and the Chianti Station Parcel (collectively
 &#8220;Seghesio Family Vineyards&#8221;).&#160;&#160;This acquisition provided an opportunity to expand operations in the Sonoma County region.

The cash purchase price was $86
018
000. The acquisition was financed by a $41
156
000 capital contribution (including funds for expenses) and a $45
000
000 note payable from Leucadia.

In accordance with acquisition accounting
 the acquired net assets were recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition (in thousands):

The methods used by the Company&#8217;s management to determine the fair values included estimating Seghesio Family Vineyards&#8217; business enterprise value through the use of a discounted cash flow analysis.&#160;&#160;Property and equipment asset valuations included an analysis of depreciated replacement cost and current market prices.&#160;&#160;The Company considered several factors to determine the fair value of property and equipment
 including local market conditions
 recent market transactions
 the size
 age
 condition

Pro forma adjustments principally reflect an increase to depreciation and amortization expenses related to the fair value of property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets and retroactively reflecting acquisition related costs of $603

 2010.


Operations of Seghesio Family Vineyards subsequent to May 31
 2011 are included in the accompanying financial statements
 which include revenue of $9
899
000; earnings for the year ended December 31
 2011 are impractical to determine as a result of shared selling and general and administrative expenses.

Prior to the Distribution
 the Company and its subsidiaries were included in the consolidated federal and certain consolidated or combined state income tax returns of Leucadia.&#160;&#160;However
 the provisions for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations have been determined on a theoretical separate-return basis.&#160;&#160;Due to the Company&#8217;s history of pre-tax losses
 it has not reflected a benefit for its net operating loss carryforwards (&#8220;NOLs&#8221;) since the Company is unable to conclude it is more likely than not that it will be able to generate future taxable income to use the NOLs.&#160;&#160;The Company files a California state income tax return separate from Leucadia.&#160;&#160;The statute of limitations with respect to the Company&#8217;s California state tax return has expired for all years through 2007.&#160;&#160;The Company currently has no unrecognized tax benefits
 and it is not reasonably possible to estimate the amount by which that could increase in the next twelve months since the timing of examinations
 if any
 is unknown.&#160;&#160;However
 given the Company&#8217;s history of operating losses
 it does not expect any significant change during the next twelve months.






















The provision (benefit) for income taxes for years ended December 31

Prior to the Distribution
 no formal tax sharing agreement was entered into between the Company and Leucadia.&#160;&#160;On the Distribution date
 the Company and Leucadia entered into a tax matters agreement that governs the parties&#8217; respective rights
 responsibilities and obligations with respect to tax liabilities and benefits
 tax attributes
 the preparation and filing of tax returns
 the control of audits and other tax proceedings and other matters regarding taxes.&#160;&#160;In general
 with respect to any periods ending at or prior to the Distribution
 Leucadia will be responsible for any federal income tax liabilities and any state or local income taxes reportable on a consolidated
 combined or unitary return
 in each case
 as would be applicable to the Company as if it filed tax returns on a stand-alone basis.&#160;&#160;With respect to any periods beginning after the Distribution
 the Company will be responsible for any federal
 state or local income taxes of it or any of its subsidiaries.&#160;&#160;The Company will not be required to reimburse Leucadia for any payments made by Leucadia for adjustments to taxable periods prior to the Distribution
 nor will the Company be entitled to any refunds for adjustments to taxable periods prior to the Distribution.&#160;&#160;The Company is responsible for any adjustments or liabilities related to its California state income tax return for all periods.

 the Company has $79

000 of federal NOLs on a separate-return basis and $38
404
000 of California State NOLs.&#160;&#160;Subsequent to the Distribution
 the Company retained all of its California State NOLs; however
 the Company retained federal NOLs only to the extent that they had not been previously used in Leucadia&#8217;s consolidated return.&#160;&#160;As a result
 the amount of federal NOLs retained by the Company is approximately $14
876
000 and the remaining NOL&#8217;s will be effectively eliminated. The federal NOL&#8217;s will not begin to expire until 2023.&#160;&#160;The expiration dates of California State NOLs are as follows (in thousands):

Under certain circumstances
 the ability to use the NOLs and future deductions could be substantially reduced if certain changes in ownership were to occur.&#160;&#160;In order to reduce this possibility
 the Company&#8217;s certificate of incorporation includes a charter restriction that prohibits transfers of the Company&#8217;s common stock under certain circumstances.

 or (ii) by wire transfer to such other office as shall be designated in writing by Borrower Representative to Agent
 in each case
 in the aggregate of the amounts made available to the Agent by the Lenders and in like funds as received by the Agent
 unless on the date of such Borrowing all or any portion of the proceeds thereof shall then be required to be applied to the repayment of any outstanding Swingline Loans pursuant to

.&#160;&#160;To the extent any Swingline Loans remain outstanding for seven (7) days
 the Swingline Lender may
 at any time
 in its sole discretion
 by written notice to Borrower Representative

 that (A) all interest payable on the Swingline Loans shall be for the account of the Swingline Lender until the date as of which the respective participation is purchased and (B) at the time any purchase of participations pursuant to this sentence is actually made
 the purchasing Lender shall be required to pay to the Swingline Lender
 to the extent not paid to the Swingline Lender by Borrowers in accordance with the terms of the Swingline Note
 interest on the principal amount of participation purchased for each day from and including the day upon which such Borrowing would otherwise have occurred to but excluding the date of payment for such participation
 at the rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate.

 and on the Term Revolving Loan Conversion Date
 no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.&#160;&#160;The Term Loan of each Lender shall be evidenced by such Lender&#8217;s Term Revolving Note; provided that
 at the request of Agent

 or that is an integral multiple of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100
000) in excess thereof) into Base Rate Loans or LIBOR Loans
 as the case may be; or

elect
 as of the last day of the applicable Interest Period
 to continue any LIBOR Loans having Interest Periods expiring on such day (or any part thereof in an amount not less than One Million Dollars ($1

Borrower Representative shall deliver a Notice of Conversion/Continuation to be received by Agent not later than 10:00 a.m. (California time) at least three Business Days in advance of the Conversion/Continuation Date
 specifying:







other than in the case of conversions into Base Rate Loans
 the duration of the requested Interest Period.
















If upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to LIBOR Loans
 Borrowers have failed to select timely a new Interest Period to be applicable to such LIBOR Loans
 or if any Default or Event of Default then exists
 Borrowers shall be deemed to have elected to convert such LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans effective as of the expiration date of such Interest Period.



Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of a Notice of Conversion/Continuation
 or
 if no timely notice is provided by Borrower Representative
 Agent will promptly notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion.&#160;&#160;All conversions and continuations of Base Rate Loans or LIBOR Loans shall be made ratably according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans with respect to which the notice was given held by each Lender.


 or (ii) if so requested by the Swingline Lender while any Default or Event of Default exists
 on such Conversion/Continuation Date or such other date that any Default or Event of Default exists
 as the case may be
 in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of such Swingline Loans
 and the procedures set forth in 
 and if so required by the Swingline Lender
 each Lender agrees that in lieu of making Revolving Loans as described in this 
 each Lender shall purchase on such date a participation from the Swingline Lender in the applicable Swingline Loans in an amount equal to such Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share of such Swingline Loans.&#160;&#160;The proceeds of such Revolving Loans

After giving effect to any conversion or continuation of Loans
 unless Agent shall otherwise consent
 there may not be more than ten (10) different Interest Periods in effect.

Borrowers may elect to fix the interest rate applicable to all or a portion of the Term Loan through the Term Loan Maturity Date at the interest rate then quoted by Agent for such period so long as (i) at least seven (7) Business Days prior to the date on which such Fixed Rate Loan is to take effect (which must be the last day of an Interest Period for any portion of the Term Loan that at such time is a LIBOR Loan)
 Borrower Representative has notified Agent in writing of such election specifying the proposed commencement date and the amount of principal so designated
 (ii) at the time of delivery of such written notice and upon the date at which the Fixed Rate Loan is scheduled to take effect
 no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing
 (iii) at no time shall there be more than a total of four (4) Fixed Rate Loans outstanding
 and (iv) the amount so designated shall be an integral multiple of One Million Dollars ($1

 upon not less than five Business Days&#8217; prior notice to Agent
 terminate the Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment or terminate the Aggregate Term Revolving Loan Commitment
 or permanently reduce the Aggregate Term Revolving Loan Commitment by an aggregate minimum amount of One Million Dollars ($1
000
000) or any multiple of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500
000) in excess thereof
 but in no event shall the Aggregate Term Revolving Loan Commitment be reduced to an amount less than Forty Million Dollars ($40
000
000); unless
 after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of Loans made on the Closing Date thereof
 the Effective Amount of all Term Revolving Loans would exceed the amount of the Aggregate Term Revolving Loan Commitment.&#160;&#160;Once reduced in accordance with this Section
 the Aggregate Term Revolving Loan Commitments may not be increased.&#160;&#160;Any voluntary reduction of the Aggregate Term Revolving Loan Commitment shall be applied to each Term Revolving Lender&#8217;s Term Revolving Loan Commitment according to its Pro Rata Share.&#160;&#160;&#160;All accrued commitment and Letter of Credit Fees to
 but not including
 the effective date of any termination of Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination.



.&#160;&#160;Borrowers may
 at any time or from time to time
 prepay Base Rate Loans in whole or in part on any date upon not less than one Business Day&#8217;s irrevocable notice from Borrower Representative to Agent and prepay LIBOR Loans or Fixed Rate Loans in whole or in part on any Interest Payment Date upon not less than three Business Days&#8217; irrevocable notice from Borrower Representative to Agent

 or
 with respect to Term Revolving Loans or the Term Loan
 One Million Dollars ($1
000

000) in excess thereof.&#160;&#160;&#160;Such notice of prepayment shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment
 the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid and whether such Loans are Revolving Loans
 Term Revolving Loans
 or the Term Loan.&#160;&#160;Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of any such notice
 and of such Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share
 if any
 of such prepayment.&#160;&#160;If notice of prepayment is given by Borrower Representative
 Borrowers shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein
 together with
 in the case of LIBOR Loans
 and in the case of Fixed Rate Loans
 accrued interest to each such date on the amount prepaid and any Prepayment Premium required pursuant to 
&#160;&#160;If Agent
 in its discretion
 accepts a prepayment on a date other than an Interest Payment Date
 or if a prepayment is for any reason received by Agent on a date that is not an Interest Payment Date
 Borrowers shall also pay any Breakage Fees resulting from such prepayment and any applicable Prepayment Premium.&#160;&#160;Any prepayment of the Term Loan shall be applied in inverse order of maturity to the regularly scheduled payments thereunder.




















.&#160;&#160;If at any time the then outstanding principal balance of Revolving Loans exceeds the Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment
 Borrowers shall immediately prepay outstanding Revolving Loans and
 to the extent necessary and applicable
 cash collateralize outstanding Letters of Credit in an amount sufficient in the aggregate to eliminate such excess in accordance herewith and in a manner satisfactory to the Issuing Banks.&#160;&#160;If at any time the then outstanding principal balance of Term Revolving Loans exceeds the Aggregate Term Revolving Loan Commitment
 Borrowers shall immediately prepay outstanding Term Revolving Loans

.&#160;&#160;If any material damage or destruction shall occur to any Mortgaged Property
 or all or any portion of a Mortgaged Property is subject to any condemnation
 Borrowers shall pay to Agent the amount required by Agent&#8217;s Mortgage on such Mortgaged&#160;&#160;Property or
 if greater
 such other amount as Agent shall in good faith determine as necessary to reduce the outstanding principal balance of the Term Revolving Loan or the Term Loan
 as applicable
 to an amount not less than seventy percent (70%) of the aggregate value of the Mortgaged Property.

 shall be applied
 first
 to any Base Rate Loans then outstanding and then to LIBOR Loans with the shortest Interest Periods remaining and then to any Fixed Rate Loan.&#160;&#160;Borrowers shall pay
 together with each prepayment of LIBOR Loans or Fixed Rate Loans under this 
 accrued interest on the amount prepaid and any amounts required pursuant to 


























.&#160;&#160;If Borrowers have not elected to convert the Term Revolving Loan into the Term Loan
 or Borrowers have made such election but do not on the Revolving Term Loan Conversion Date
 satisfy the requirements to convert the Term Revolving Loan into the Term Loan
 Borrowers shall repay to the Term Revolving Lenders in full on the Term Revolving Loan Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of Term Revolving Loans outstanding on such date.

.&#160;&#160;Borrowers shall repay the principal balance of the Term Loan in quarterly installments commencing July&#160;1
 2018 and continuing on the first day of each October
 January
 April
 and July thereafter with a final principal payment due on the Term Loan Maturity Date.&#160;&#160;Each quarterly installment shall be in an amount equal to one-fortieth (1/40) of the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan on Revolving Term Loan Conversion Date (i.e.
 ten-year straight line amortization) with a balloon payment on the Term Loan Maturity Date equal to the then outstanding balance of the Term Loan.



Each Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable Borrowing Date at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR or the Base Rate
 plus the Applicable Margin
 or the Swingline Rate
 as selected by Borrower Representative in its Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation (subject to Borrowers&#8217; right to convert to other Types of Loans under 
 including Borrowers&#8217; right to select Fixed Rate Loans).

Interest on each Loan shall be paid in arrears on each Interest Payment Date and on the Revolving Loan Termination Date with respect to the Revolving Loans
 on Revolving Term Loan Termination Date with respect to the Term Revolving Loans (unless the Term Revolving Loans are being converted into the Term Loan in which case accrued interest shall be payable on the next Interest Payment Date)
for the portion of LIBOR Loans so prepaid and upon payment (including prepayment) in full thereof and
 during the existence of any Event of Default
 interest on any Loan shall be paid on demand of Agent.&#160;&#160;Agent is authorized to
 and at its sole election may
 charge to the Revolving Loan balance on behalf of Borrowers and cause to be paid all amounts due with respect to interest
 fees
 expenses
 charges
 and costs
 other than principal of the Revolving Loan
 owing by any Credit Party to Agent or Lenders if and to the extent such Credit Party fail to pay promptly any such amounts as and when due.&#160;&#160;Any amount so charged shall be considered a Base Rate Loan.



















 while any Event of Default exists or after acceleration
 interest shall accrue (after as well as before entry of judgment thereon to the extent permitted by law) on the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations
 at the Default Rate.

Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding
 the obligations of Borrowers to any Lender hereunder shall be subject to the limitation that payments of interest shall not be required
 for any period for which interest is computed hereunder
 to the extent (but only to the extent) that contracting for or receiving such payment by such Lender would be contrary to the provisions of any law applicable to such Lender limiting the highest rate of interest that may be lawfully contracted for
 charged or received by such Lender
 and in such event Borrowers shall pay such Lender interest at the highest rate permitted by applicable law.

Borrowers shall indemnify each Lender and hold each Lender harmless from and against any loss
 cost or expense incurred or realized by such Lender (collectively
&#8221;) as a consequence of the repayment of any portion of any LIBOR Loan on a day that is not an Interest Payment Date (regardless of whether any such loss
 cost or expense relates to (i) fees and expenses payable under LIBOR contracts purchased by such Lender
 or (ii)&#160;loss of income sustained by such Lender as a result of a prepayment prior to a Interest Payment Date).&#160;&#160;To the extent permitted by law
 Agent may bid at any foreclosure sale
 as part of the Obligations
 the amount of the Breakage Fees
 if any
 calculated as if prepayment of any Loan occurs on the date of such foreclosure sale.&#160;&#160;To the extent the amount of the Obligations must be determined as of a date certain pursuant to a judicial foreclosure
 each Loan will be deemed prepaid as of the date judgment enters and the Breakage Fees (if any) due and payable hereunder (if any) will be calculated as if prepayment of such Loan occurred on the date of said judgment.

 in accordance with the parameters for calculation and adjustment of such amount also set forth in such definition.&#160;&#160;Such Revolving Loan Unused Line Fee shall accrue from the Closing Date to the Revolving Loan Termination Date
 and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter
 with the final payment to be made on the Revolving Loan Termination Date; 
 that
 in connection with any reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitments under 
 the accrued Revolving Loan Unused Line Fee calculated for the period ending on such date shall also be paid on the date of such reduction.&#160;&#160;The Revolving Loan Unused Line Fee shall accrue at all times after the Closing Date
 including at any time during which one or more conditions in Article V are not met.&#160;&#160;For purposes of calculating utilization under this 
 the Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment shall be deemed used to the extent of the Effective Amount of all Revolving Loans

 the Aggregate Term Revolving Loan Commitment shall be deemed used to the extent of the Effective Amount of all Term Revolving Loans.






















Each determination of an interest rate by Agent shall be conclusive and binding on Borrowers and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error.&#160;&#160;Agent will
 at the request of any Lender
 deliver to such Lender a statement showing the quotations used by Agent in determining any interest rate and the resulting interest rate.



All payments to be made by Borrowers shall be made without set-off
 recoupment or counterclaim.&#160;&#160;Except as otherwise expressly provided herein
 all payments by Borrowers shall be made to Agent for the account of the Lenders at Agent&#8217;s Payment Office
 and shall be made in dollars and in immediately available funds
 no later than 11:00 a.m. (California time) on the date specified herein
 and Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as expressly provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received.&#160;&#160;In the case of payments by Borrowers in respect of Swingline Loans
 the Agent will promptly distribute to the Swingline Lender such payment in like funds as received.&#160;&#160;Any payment received by Agent later than 11:00 a.m. (California time) shall be deemed to have been received on the following Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.

Subject to the provisions set forth in the definition of &#8220;Interest Period&#8221; herein
 whenever any payment is due on a day other than a Business Day
 such payment shall be made on the following Business Day
 and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or fees
 as the case may be.

Unless Agent receives notice from Borrower Representative prior to the date on which any payment is due that Borrowers will not make such payment in full as and when required
 Agent may assume that Borrowers have made such payment in full to Agent on such date in immediately available funds and Agent may (but shall not be so required)
 in reliance upon such assumption
 distribute to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender.&#160;&#160;If and to the extent Borrowers have not made such payment in full to Agent
 each Lender shall repay to Agent on demand such amount distributed to such Lender
 together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date repaid.

.&#160;&#160;Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary
 after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default
 all amounts collected or received by Agent
 or any Lender on account of Borrowers&#8217; Obligations or any other amounts outstanding under any of the Credit Documents or in respect of the Collateral shall be paid over or delivered as follows unless otherwise determined by Agent in its sole discretion:

FIRST
 to the payment of all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys&#8217; fees) of Agent in connection with enforcing the rights of Agent and the Lenders under the Credit Documents and any protective advances made by Agent with respect to the Collateral under or pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Documents;

SECOND
 to payment of fees
 if any
 owed to Agent in its capacity as Agent;

THIRD
 to the payment of out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys&#8217; fees) of each Lender in connection with enforcing its rights under the Credit Documents or otherwise with respect to the Borrowers&#8217; Obligations owing to such Lender;

FOURTH
 to the payment of all of the Borrowers&#8217; Obligations consisting of accrued fees and interest;

FIFTH
 to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the Borrowers&#8217; Obligations
 including any Swap Obligations;

SIXTH
 to payment of all other of the Borrowers&#8217; Obligations and other obligations which shall have become due and payable under the Credit Documents or otherwise and not repaid pursuant to clauses &#8220;FIRST&#8221; through &#8220;FIFTH&#8221; above;

SEVENTH
 to Cash Collateralize L/C Obligations; and

EIGHTH
 to the payment of the surplus
 if any
 to whoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

In carrying out the foregoing
 (i) amounts received shall be applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next succeeding category; and (ii) each of the Lenders shall receive an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of amounts available to be applied pursuant to clauses &#8220;THIRD&#8221;
 &#8220;FOURTH&#8221;
 &#8220;FIFTH&#8221; and &#8220;SIXTH&#8221; above.


















Unless Agent receives notice from a Lender on or prior to the Closing Date or
 with respect to any Borrowing after the Closing Date
 at least one Business Day prior to the date of such Borrowing
 that such Lender will not make available as and when required hereunder to Agent for the account of Borrowers the amount of that Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share of the Borrowing
 Agent may assume that each Lender has made such amount available to Agent in immediately available funds on the Borrowing Date and Agent may (but shall not be so required)
 in reliance upon such assumption
 make available to Borrowers on such date a corresponding amount.&#160;&#160;If and to the extent any Lender shall not have made its full amount available to Agent in immediately available funds and Agent in such circumstances has made available to Borrowers such amount
 that Lender shall on the Business Day following such Borrowing Date make such amount available to Agent
 shall be conclusive
 absent manifest error.&#160;&#160;If such amount is so made available
 such payment to Agent shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan on the date of Borrowing for all purposes of this Agreement.&#160;&#160;If such amount is not made available to Agent on the Business Day following the Borrowing Date
 Agent will notify Borrower Representative of such failure to fund and
 upon demand by Agent
 Borrowers shall pay such amount to Agent for Agent&#8217;s account
 together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such Borrowing
 at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing.

The failure of any Lender to make any Loan on any Borrowing Date shall not relieve any other Lender of any obligation hereunder to make a Loan on such Borrowing Date
 but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Loan to be made by such other Lender on any Borrowing Date.

Sharing of Payments
 Return of Payments

 other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein
 any Lender shall obtain on account of the Obligations in its favor any payment (whether voluntary
 involuntary
 through the exercise of any right of set-off
 or otherwise) in excess of its Pro Rata Share (or other share contemplated hereunder)
 such Lender shall immediately (a)&#160;notify Agent of such fact
 and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment pro rata with each of them; 
 that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender
 such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor
 together with an amount equal to such paying Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender&#8217;s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered.&#160;&#160;Borrowers agree that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may
 to the fullest extent permitted by law
 exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off
 and will in each case notify the Lenders and
 unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
 the Borrowers following any such purchases or repayments.&#160;&#160;If Agent pays an amount to a Lender under this Agreement in the belief or expectation that a related payment has been or will be received by Agent from Borrowers and such related payment is not received by Agent
 then Agent will be entitled to recover such amount from such Lender on demand without setoff
 counterclaim or deduction of any kind.&#160;&#160;If Agent determines at any time that any amount received by Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document must be returned to any Credit Party or paid to any other Person pursuant to any insolvency law or otherwise
 then
 notwithstanding any other term or condition of this Agreement or any other Loan Document
 Agent will not be required to distribute any portion thereof to any Lender.&#160;&#160;In addition
 each Lender will repay to Agent on demand any portion of such amount that Agent has distributed to such Lender
 together with interest at such rate
 if any
 as Agent is required to pay to Borrowers or such other Person
 without setoff
 counterclaim or deduction of any kind
 and Agent will be entitled to set-off against future distributions to such Lender any such amounts (with interest) that are not repaid on demand.

.&#160;&#160;All Obligations of Borrowers (and their Subsidiaries
 if applicable) under this Agreement and all other Loan Documents shall be secured in accordance with the Security Agreement and the other Collateral Documents.

 provided that no Revolving Lender shall be reallocated any such amounts or be required to fund any amounts that would cause the sum of its outstanding Revolving Loans
 outstanding L/C Obligations
 amounts of its participations in Swingline Loans and its pro rata share of unparticipated amounts in Swingline Loans to exceed its Revolving Loan Commitment.

Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary
 including 
 a Non-Funding Lender (other than a Non-Funding Lender after the Conversion Date) shall not have any voting or consent rights under or with respect to any Loan Document or constitute a &#8220;Lender&#8221; or a &#8220;Revolving Lender&#8221; or a &#8220;Term Revolving Lender&#8221; (or be

 if necessary to effectuate the foregoing
 the other Revolving Lenders shall be deemed to have sold
 and such Non-Funding Lender shall be deemed to have purchased
 Revolving Loans or Letter of Credit participation interests from the other Revolving Lenders

 any amounts applied by Agent to satisfy such funding shortfalls shall be deemed to constitute a Term Revolving Loan or amount of the participation required to be funded and
 if necessary to effectuate the foregoing
 the other Term Revolving Lenders shall be deemed to have sold
 and such Non-Funding Lender shall be deemed to have purchased

 the Aggregate Excess Funding Amount
 plus all interest due thereon and (ii) timely funds the next Revolving Loan or Term Revolving Loan
 as applicable

A Lender that is a Non-Funding Lender pursuant to clause (a) of the definition of Non-Funding Lender shall not earn and shall not be entitled to receive
 and Borrowers shall not be required to pay
 such Lender&#8217;s portion of the Unused Commitment Fee during the time such Lender is a Non-Funding Lender pursuant to clause (a) thereof.

 if any
 equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) a fraction
 the numerator of which shall be the principal amount of the Fixed Rate Loan or Fixed Rate Loans being accelerated or prepaid (which
 in the case of acceleration
 shall be all principal under all Fixed Rate Loans) and the denominator of which shall be the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan immediately prior to such acceleration or prepayment
 by (ii) the excess
 if any
 of the Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to the Term Loan over the amount of the Term Loan
 provided that the Prepayment Premium may in no event be less than zero.

For the purposes of determining the applicable Prepayment Premium
 the following terms have the following meanings:

 as of 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the second Business Day preceding the prepayment date for on-the-run U.S. Treasury securities having a maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of the Term Loan as of the prepayment date.&#160;&#160;Such implied yield will be determined
 if necessary
 by (a) converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations to bond-equivalent yields in accordance with a method of accepted financial practice selected by Agent and (b) interpolating linearly between (1) the on-the-run U.S. Treasury security with the maturity closest to and greater than the Remaining Average Life and (2) the on-the-run U.S. Treasury security with the maturity closest to and less than the Remaining Average Life.



&#8221; means all principal payments of the Term Loan and interest thereon that would be due after the prepayment date if no payment of the Term Loan was made prior to its scheduled due date
 provided that if such prepayment date is not a date on which interest payments are due to be made
 then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to the prepayment date.

.&#160;&#160;Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Loan Document to the contrary
 upon acceleration of the Term Loan pursuant to this Agreement
 a Prepayment Premium shall be immediately and automatically due and payable on the date of such acceleration with respect to each Fixed Rate Loan outstanding on the date of acceleration.

TAXES
 YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY



Any and all payments by Borrowers to each Lender or Agent under this Agreement and any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of
 and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes.&#160;&#160;In addition
 Borrowers shall pay all Other Taxes.

Each Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Lender and Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Lender or Agent and any liability (including penalties
 interest
 additions to tax and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto
 whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted.&#160;&#160;Payment under this indemnification shall be made within 30 days after the date the Lender or Agent makes written demand therefor.

If a Borrower shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender or Agent
 then:

the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions and withholdings (including deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) such Lender or Agent
 as the case may be
 receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made;





such Borrower shall also pay to each Lender or Agent for the account of such Lender
 at the time interest is paid
 all additional amounts which the respective Lender specifies as necessary to preserve the after-tax yield the Lender would have received if such Taxes or Other Taxes had not been imposed.

If requested by Agent
 Borrowers shall
 within 30 days after the date of any payment by a Borrower of Taxes or Other Taxes
 furnish Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof
 or other evidence of payment satisfactory to Agent.


 then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office so as to eliminate any such additional payment by Borrowers that may thereafter accrue
 if such change in the judgment of such Lender is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.




















If any Lender determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding on Borrowers in the absence of manifest error) that the introduction of any Requirement of Law
 or any change in any Requirement of Law
 or in the interpretation or administration of any Requirement of Law
 has made it unlawful
 in each case as a result of compliance by such Lender in good faith with any applicable Requirement of Law
 or that any central bank or other Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful
 for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make LIBOR Loans
 then
 upon written notice setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such determination by the Lender to Borrower Representative through Agent
 any obligation of that Lender to make LIBOR Loans shall be suspended until the Lender notifies Agent and Borrower Representative that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.

If a Lender determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding on Borrowers in the absence of manifest error) that it is unlawful as a result of compliance by such Lender in good faith with any applicable Requirement of Law to maintain any LIBOR Loan
 Borrowers shall
 within three Business Days of receipt by Borrower Representative of written notice setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such determination and demand from such Lender (with a copy to Agent)
 prepay in full such LIBOR Loans of that Lender then outstanding
 together with interest accrued thereon and amounts required under 
 either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof
 if the Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Loans to such day
 or immediately
 if the Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Loan.&#160;&#160;If Borrowers are required to so prepay any LIBOR Loan
 then concurrently with and to fund such prepayment
 Borrowers shall borrow from the affected Lender
 in the amount of such repayment

If the obligation of any Lender to make or maintain LIBOR Loans has been so terminated or suspended
 Borrowers may elect
 by delivery by Borrower Representative of written notice to the Lender through Agent that all Loans which would otherwise be made by the Lender as LIBOR Loans shall be instead Base Rate Loans.

Before giving any notice to Agent under this Section
 the affected Lender shall designate a different Lending Office with respect to its LIBOR Loans if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice or making such demand and will not
 in the judgment of the Lender
 be illegal or otherwise disadvantageous to the Lender.



If any Lender determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding on Borrowers in the absence of manifest error) that
 due to either (i) the introduction of or any change (other than any change by way of imposition of or increase in reserve requirements included in the calculation of the LIBOR) in or in the interpretation of any Requirement of Law or regulation or (ii) the compliance by that Lender with any Requirement of Law
 guideline
 or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law)
 there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making
 funding or maintaining any LIBOR Loans
 then Borrowers shall be liable for
 and shall from time to time
 upon receipt of a written statement and demand (with a copy of such demand to be sent to Agent)
 pay to Agent for the account of such Lender
 additional amounts as are sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased costs; 
 that Borrowers shall have the right to defer the initial payment to such Lender for such increased costs until thirty days after such Lender delivers such written statement and demand.&#160;&#160;Any such notice and demand shall be made within 180 days after the event or circumstance giving rise to such demand and shall be accompanied by a reasonable explanation as to the basis for such demand and a certification by such Lender that the demand on Borrowers is consistent with demands being made on similarly situated borrowers.&#160;&#160;Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the change in Requirements of Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor.

If any Lender shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding on Borrowers in the absence of manifest error) that (i) the introduction after the Closing Date of any Capital Adequacy Regulation
 (ii) any change after the Closing Date in any Capital Adequacy Regulation
 (iii) any change after the Closing Date in the interpretation or administration of any Capital Adequacy Regulation by any central bank or other Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof
 or (iv)&#160;compliance by the Lender (or its Lending Office) or any corporation controlling the Lender with any Capital Adequacy Regulation
 affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by the Lender or any corporation controlling the Lender and (taking into consideration such Lender&#8217;s or such corporation&#8217;s policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender&#8217;s desired return on capital) determines that the amount of such capital is increased as a consequence of its Commitment
 Loans
 credits or obligations under this Agreement
 then
 upon written notice and demand of such Lender to Borrowers through Agent
 Borrowers shall pay to the Lender
 from time to time as specified by the Lender
 additional amounts sufficient to compensate the Lender for such increase; 
 that Borrowers shall have the right to defer the initial payment to such Lender for such increase until thirty days after such Lender delivers such initial demand.&#160;&#160;Any such demand shall be made within 180 days after the event or circumstance giving rise to such demand and shall be accompanied by a reasonable explanation as to the basis for such demand and a certification by such Lender that the demand on Borrowers is consistent with demands being made on similarly situated borrowers. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the change in Requirements of Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor.
