 Inc. is an agritech company that owns existing
 and seeks to develop new
 products and processes that convert generally available agricultural by-products into multi-functional all-natural ingredients that can be used in food manufacturing and other industries. We currently sell a line of all-natural products to the food industry designed to help manufacturers reduce their costs
 improve the quality of finished goods
 and solve many production problems.&#160; Our innovative technology can provide value-added all-natural ingredients across virtually all food industry categories.&#160; These products offer a range of functional attributes
 including helping to reduce fat and calories
 adding fiber
 improving shelf-stability
 preventing oil migration
 and enhancing binding capacity &#8211; all without degrading the taste and texture of the final food products.&#160; Perhaps most significantly
 Z Trim&#8217;s ingredients can help extend the life of finished products





 while maintaining the essential taste and mouth-feel associated with full-fat products.&#160;&#160;The potential global market for Z Trim&#8217;s line of products spans the entire food and nutritional beverage industry
 including fat-free
 low-fat
 reduced-fat and full-fat
 across meats
 baked goods
 dairy and non-dairy products
 snacks
 beverages
 dressings




 we opened an industrial products division focusing on the manufacture
 marketing and sales of products designed specifically for industrial applications
 including oil drilling fluids
 petroleum coke
 charcoal briquettes
 hydraulic fracturing
 and paper and wood adhesives.&#160; When used in industrial operations
 we believe that Z Trim&#8217;s products can reduce costs
 enhance supply-chain reliability
 limit environmental impact
 and improve finished product quality compared to current products such as guar gum
 xanthan gum
 CMC
 lignosulfonates and starches used as binders
 adhesives
 viscofiers or emulsifiers. In January 2013
 we entered into a joint development agreement with Newpark Drilling Fluids LLC
 a subsidiary of Newpark Resources
 Inc.
 to develop new







 including moisture management
 oil deflection
 texture and appearance quality
 fat and calorie reduction. Perhaps most significantly
 these attributes allow manufacturers using Z Trim to reduce costs of finished products by replacing more expensive ingredients with Z Trim fiber and water.&#160; Z Trim&#174; is now being used by food manufacturers world-wide
 across a multitude of food categories
 such as meats
 sauces
 soups
 dressings
 baked goods
 fillings
 toppings
 prepared meals
 dairy products
 frozen handheld snacks
 and pizza dough. Food formulators are seeking greater functionality and product performance than they can get from starches
 gums
 fats
 and other fibers &#8211; for both standard and lower fat content foods - and are increasingly discovering how Z Trim&#174; multifunctional ingredients can help to delight their consumers with finished products that we believe have enhanced eating quality
 outstanding product performance
 and frequently




 increasing obesity trends
 the economy
 rising costs and hectic lifestyles have triggered an evolution of the food industry and consumer expectations.&#160; Our goal is to further enable food manufacturers to address the challenges and opportunities of this evolution by helping them to lower their costs
 differentiate their products
 achieve their growth objectives
 and delight their customers.&#160; Through ongoing product applications research
 we develop solutions that help food manufacturers solve formulation and product challenges and capture market opportunities with high quality




 taste




 2013




 we opened an industrial division seeking to serve a variety of industries
 including
 but not limited to
 oil drilling
 hydraulic fracturing
 petroleum coking
 pharmaceuticals
 nutracuticals
 paper and corrugated box adhesives

















 as well as small and midsize companies for packaged retail foods
 and (ii) direct and brokered sales to large and small foodservice manufacturers that supply to restaurants
 hospitals
 schools and cafeterias. In addition to direct sales
 we use a network of ingredient distributors
 both domestic and international







 depending on the food application
 required functional properties and product development objectives
 competitive ingredients might include gums (e.g.
 guar
 xanthan
 locust bean
 and Arabic)
 seaweed extracts (e.g.
 alginates
 carrageenan)
 starches (native
 modified and resistant)
 and fibers (e.g.
 oat bran
 corn bran
 pea fiber
 potato fiber).&#160; Most of these competitive ingredients are well-established in the food industry
 and many of the companies that supply them have substantially greater resources than we do.&#160; However
 we believe that the unique properties of Z Trim multifunctional fiber ingredients pose not only significant market opportunities for us
 but also provide differentiation and growth opportunities for food companies.&#160; We believe that no other single hydrocolloid or fiber has the combined water holding and binding capacity that is effective across as wide a pH and temperature range as Z Trim&#174;
 nor imparts as many superior attributes to the finished consumer food product.&#160; Furthermore
 we believe Z Trim&#174; ingredients can have synergistic effects with other hydrocolloids and fibers
 allowing food manufacturers to achieve even greater processing improvements
 cost efficiencies
 and finished product performance.&#160; Many of the same ingredients used in foods are also used for industrial applications
 where they compete with a similar complement of ingredients.&#160; We believe that our products&#8217; unique functionalities
 combined with the fact that they are produced domestically from abundant raw material sources (agricultural by-products)







 which are generally available from a variety of suppliers.&#160; Our major suppliers include Agricor
 Inc. and Hydrite Chemical. We seek to mitigate the risk of a shortage of raw materials through identification of alternative suppliers for the same or similar raw materials
 where available. We have purchasing staff with extensive knowledge of our products that work with marketing

 of total sales for the year ended December 31
 2014.&#160; There were three significant customers who accounted for 36%
 24% and 5%

 as well as trade secrets and know how.&#160; Our intellectual property includes an exclusive license to US Patent No. 5
766
662
 including all related international patents
 issued to Dr. George Inglett of the USDA.&#160; Our license expires upon the expiration of the underlying patent in 2015
 and we will therefore lose our patent protection at that time.&#160; Additionally



 we have identified and sought patent protection for improvements to the manufacturing process
 product applications and is currently developing several spin-off technologies.&#160; On December 1
 2009
 we were issued U.S. Patent No. 7
625
591 B2; which expires in 2026 subject to the payment of maintenance fees.&#160;&#160;On July 27
 2010
 we were issued U.S. Patent No. 7
763
301; which will expire in 2027 subject to payment of maintenance fees.&#160;&#160;These patents expand the raw material sources for the creation of Z Trim products as well as incorporate blends of ingredients combined with Z Trim.&#160;&#160;In July 2012 we
 jointly with the USDA
 filed a provisional patent for our BioFiber Gum line of products
 seeking patent protection for the composition of matter
 process for making
 as well as applications for
 our proprietary soluble fibers (application number: PCT/US2013/049116).&#160; We have three additional provisional patents on file that cover composition
 process and various applications of Z Trim and BioFiber Gum

















 state
 local and foreign laws and regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. Food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal
 state
 local
 and foreign agencies.&#160; However
 as Z Trim ingredients are made from natural raw material sources (corn and oat)
 they are considered Generally Recognized As Safe or &#8220;GRAS&#8221; and therefore not subject to many of the regulations applicable to foods.&#160; Should the products lose their GRAS designation




 the FDA approved the labeling of Z Trim products in meat applications. Specifically
 the FDA has approved the use of Z Trim ingredients in ground
 emulsified
 and processed meats and poultry.&#160; We believe this will create the potential for increased sales







 in conjunction with our customers and strategic industry partners
 including the USDA
 continues to work on the development of additional products and applications.&#160; In June 2011
 we entered into a 3-year agreement with the USDA to conduct joint research for the development of additional products and processes relating to its current patented products.&#160; This agreement has been amended and the duration extended through May 31
 2016.&#160; We require all employees and visitors to our plant to execute a non-disclosure agreement.&#160; Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies and to obtain patent coverage for these products and technologies. We intend to continue to file patent applications covering any newly developed products and technologies. However

 our operations have been funded primarily through the sale of both equity and debt securities.&#160; In January and February 2015
 we raised an aggregate of $1
540

 we still require additional financing to fully implement our business plan for the next twelve months and beyond.&#160; Our current cash on hand is insufficient for us to be able to maintain its operations at the current level through the end of the fiscal 2015.&#160; In order to continue to pursue our business plan
 we will require additional funding. If we are not able to secure additional funding
 the implementation of our business plan will be delayed and its ability to maintain or expand operations will be impaired. We intend to secure additional funding through debt or equity financing arrangements

 mainly corn bran and oat hull. Historically
 the costs of corn bran and oat hull are subject to fluctuations depending upon a number of factors which affect commodity prices in general and over which we have no control
 including crop conditions
 weather
 government programs and purchases by foreign governments. Commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material
 packaging
 and energy costs.&#160; We currently do not hedge against changes in commodity prices.&#160; If we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices










 Aveka Nutra Processing




 we could have a delay in supplying products to customers if other customers of ANP should occupy ANPs production capacity at a time when we require products to be manufactured.
 Our operations may be subject to significant interruption if the ANP facility experiences a major accident or is damaged by severe weather or other natural disasters.&#160; In addition
 the ANP operation may be subject to labor disruptions and unscheduled downtime
 or other operational hazards inherent in the industry
 such as equipment failures
 fires
 explosions
 abnormal pressures
 blowouts
 pipeline ruptures
 transportation accidents and natural disasters. Some of these operational hazards may cause personal injury or loss of life
 severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or environmental damage
 and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. Our insurance may not be adequate to fully cover the potential operational hazards described above; in addition








 including nutraceuticals
 functional food ingredients
 oils
 and gums.&#160; A large number of businesses are engaged in various fat replacement industries. Many of our competitors have established reputations for successfully developing and marketing their products
 including products that are widely recognized as providing similar calorie reduction. In addition
 many of our competitors have greater financial
 managerial
 and technical resources than we have.&#160;&#160; If we are not successful in competing in these markets




 and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products




 trademarks
 trade secrets
 copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us.&#160; Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products and services.&#160; For example
 effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed.&#160; Also
 the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective.&#160; Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete.&#160; Also







 it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations.&#160; In addition
 given the costs of obtaining patent protection
 we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important.&#160; Furthermore
 there is always the possibility
 despite our efforts







 we seek to protect our proprietary information and know-how through the use of trade secrets
 confidentiality agreements and other similar security measures. With respect to patents
 there can be no assurance that any applications for patent protection will be granted
 or
 if granted
 will offer meaningful protection.&#160; Some of the technology employed by us in our products is licensed to us by the USDA. The original USDA patent expires in 2015 and we will therefore lose our patent protection with respect to that patent at that time. Although we have four additional provisional patents on file that cover composition
 process and various applications
 each filed jointly with the USDA
 there can be no assurance that new patents will in fact be issued or that they will provide effective protection.&#160; In addition
 we have received two other patents in our own name:&#160; Patent Nos. 7
763
301 and 7
625
591 that were issued in 2009 and 2010




 there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop
 patent or gain access to similar know-how and technology
 or reverse engineer our products













 especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However
 trade secrets are difficult to protect. In order to protect our proprietary technology and processes
 we also rely in part on confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our corporate partners
 employees
 consultants
 outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers and other advisors. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information nor result in the effective assignment to us of intellectual property
 and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or other breaches of the agreements. In addition
 others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information
 and in such case we could not assert any trade secret rights against such party. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult
 expensive and time consuming
 and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition
 courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to seek to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights







 including patent
 trademark
 copyright and trade secret protection.&#160; Our competitors
 however
 may design around our patent claims
 rendering our patent protection ineffective against such competitors.&#160; Similarly
 our competitors may independently develop technology similar to our trade secrets and technical know-how.&#160; Such occurrences could increase competitive pressure on our marketing and sales efforts







 whether meritorious or not
 could be time consuming and result in costly litigation.&#160; If any of our practices are found to be in violation of another party&#8217;s rights
 we may be required to pay monetary damages or licensing fees
 which could be substantial
 or cease making products which are deemed to be infringing.&#160; Any of those occurrences could substantially harm our business




 misbranded
 or mislabeled




 misbranded
 or mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall
 the destruction of product inventory
 and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. In such a case
 or in the event that injuries are determined to arise from our products
 we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity
 damage to our reputation
 and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products








 and compliance with existing or future laws and regulations may require us to incur substantial expenditures or require us to make product recalls.&#160; As such
 we are subject to a broad range of federal
 state
 local and foreign laws and regulations intended to protect public health and the environment.&#160; Food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal
 state
 local
 and foreign agencies.&#160; Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional or different regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions
 causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.&#160; In addition
 we advertise our products.&#160; Our advertisements could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal
 state




 including the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Trade Bureau
 the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
 the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency
 and by various state and local authorities.&#160; Such regulation covers virtually every aspect of our operations
 including production facilities
 marketing
 pricing
 labeling
 packaging
 advertising
 water usage
 waste water discharge
 disposal of hazardous wastes and omissions and other matters.&#160; Violations of any of these laws and regulations may result in administrative
 civil or criminal penalties being levied against us
 permit revocation or modification
 performance of environmental investigatory or remedial activities
 voluntary or involuntary product recalls














 permitting the sale of the products anywhere in the United States without obtaining a license. Should the products lose their GRAS designation








 including litigation brought by former employees. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings
 we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business
 financial condition and results of operations. In addition
 any significant litigation in the future
 regardless of its merits








 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.&#160; In our annual evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting conducted by management as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 at December 31
 2014
 we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that
 as of December 31
 2014
 we did not maintain effective control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. For a detailed description of these material weaknesses
 see Item 9A
 &#8220;Controls and Procedures
&#8221; herein.&#160; Each of our material weaknesses results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements that we prepare will not be prevented or detected. As a result




 2014
 we carried out an evaluation
 under the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
 of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a &#8211; 15(c) and 15d &#8211; 15(e)).&#160; Based upon that evaluation
 our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that
 as of the end of the period covered in this report
 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer




 or fail to update our internal control over financial reporting as our business evolves
 we may not be able to timely or accurately report our financial condition
 results of operations or cash flows or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to report financial information in a timely and accurate manner or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures
 we could be subject to
 among other things
 regulatory or enforcement actions by the SEC
 securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence







 in part
 on the efforts and abilities of our management team and other key employees. Their skills
 experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration. The failure to attract and retain members of our management team and other key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results. In addition
 transitions of important responsibilities to new individuals inherently include the possibility of disruptions to our business and operations
 which could negatively affect our business
 financial condition

















 investors may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations of our common stock and may experience a lack of buyers to purchase such stock or a lack of market makers to support the stock price.&#160; Being a penny stock also could limit the liquidity of our common stock and limit the coverage of our stock by analysts.&#160; The OTCQB generally provides less liquidity than stock exchanges like NYSE or NASDAQ.&#160; Stocks trading on the OTC markets may be very thinly traded and highly volatile.&#160; Therefore
 holders of our common stock may be unable to sell their shares at any price
 whether or not such shares have been registered for resale.&#160; A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth
 liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common shares at any given time.&#160; This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control.&#160; Given the lower trading volume of our common shares
 significant sales of our common shares
 or the expectation of these sales







 the bid price of our common stock is less than the minimum bid price required to obtain a listing. Trading in our common stock continues to be conducted in the over-the-counter market. As a result
 an investor may find it difficult to dispose of or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock
 and our common stock may be less attractive for margin loans
 for investment by larger financial institutions




 or the loss of




 and may continue to do so.&#160; In 2014 our stock had high and low bid prices of $0.90 and $0.15
 respectively. In 2013
 our common stock had high and low bid prices of $2.70 and $0.52 per share


















 the stock market in general has recently experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance or financial condition of individual companies.&#160; Any broad market or industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock

Because the SEC imposes additional sales practice requirements on brokers who deal in our shares
 which are penny stocks
 some brokers may be unwilling to trade them.&#160; This means that you may have difficulty in reselling your shares and may cause the price of the shares to decline



 subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules
 which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and &#8220;accredited investors&#8221;. The term &#8220;accredited investor&#8221; refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5
000
000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1
000
000 or annual income exceeding $200
000 or $300
000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer
 prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules
 to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock
 the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer&#8217;s account. The bid and offer quotations and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer&#8217;s confirmation. In addition
 the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules
 the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser&#8217;s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently
 these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in

 FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer
 a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative
 low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers
 broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer&#8217;s financial status
 tax status
 investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules
 FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock

 Warrant Programs
 Waivers
 Cashless Exercises and Anti-dilution Adjustments during the Year Ended December 31



 we completed a warrant exercise program
 which resulted in the exercise of 1
756
088 warrants into 1
756
088 shares of common stock.&#160; The warrant program
 which was open to all holders of $1.50 warrants
 allowed those warrant holders to exercise their warrants for a $1.25 strike price during February 2013; it also required a waiver of the anti-dilution provisions in these warrants until February 28
 2013 so that those provisions would not be triggered by the exercises. The conversion of these warrants raised approximately $2.2 million in additional capital for us



 2013
 we entered into a private placement subscription agreement with Brightline Ventures I-C
 LLC (together with Brightline Ventures I
 LLC and Brightline Ventures I-B
 LLC
 referred to collectively herein as &#8220;Brightline&#8221; unless the context indicates otherwise) pursuant to which it sold 376
000 shares of common stock
 at a price of $1.25 per share (the &#8220;$1.25 Raise&#8221;)
 and received gross proceeds of $470




 we (i) allowed the holders of our outstanding warrants with a $1.50 per share exercise price (the &#8220;$1.50 Warrants&#8221;) with certain anti-dilution provisions contained in the warrant agreements to choose to exercise their $1.50 Warrants on a cashless basis such that for every ten $1.50 warrants exercised
 the holder received 4.5 shares of common stock (fractional shares were rounded up) (the &#8220;Cashless Exercise Program&#8221;)
 (ii) sought a temporary waiver from the holders of the $1.50 Warrants of the anti-dilution provisions in the warrant agreements with respect to the Cashless Exercise Program and potential capital-raising activities (other than the $1.25 Raise) by us prior to December 31
 2014

742 shares of common stock (including 5
718
750 $1.50 Warrants that were converted by Brightline Ventures I
 LLC into 2
573
438 shares of common stock).&#160; As a result of the Cashless Exercise Program
 we recognized a loss on equity modification of $990
656&#8212;the difference in value between the $1.50 Warrants exercised and the common stock issued for the three months ended September 30




 2013 transaction with Brightline Ventures I
 pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions contained in the $1.50 Warrants that were not exercised as part of the Cashless Exercise Program
 we reduced the exercise price of the remaining warrants to $1.25 per share and adjusted the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of those warrants such that for every five warrants owned
 each remaining holder of $1.50 Warrants received one additional warrant with an exercise price of $1.25 per share.&#160; Thus
 we issued an additional 2
376




 2013
 we entered into a private placement subscription agreement with Brightline Ventures I-C pursuant to which it sold 468
571 shares of common stock at a price of $1.05 per share
 along with warrants to purchase 234
286 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.50 per share (the &#8220;$1.05 Raise&#8221;)
 and received gross proceeds of $492
000.&#160; The waiver indicated above was effective for the $1.05 Raise; therefore







 2013
 we completed a public offering of 1
866
667 shares of common stock at $0.75 per share and warrants to purchase up to 1
400
000 shares of common stock.&#160; For every share of common stock purchased in the public offering
 the investor received a warrant to purchase three-quarters (3/4) of a share of common stock.&#160; The warrants have an exercise price of $1.00 per share and a term of exercise of five years from date of issuance.&#160; We realized net proceeds from this public offering of $1
210







 plus accrued dividends into 3
859
697 shares of common stock.&#160;&#160; Following the above conversions






 2013
 we entered into an agreement with Maxim Group
 LLC
 pursuant to which Maxim agreed to act as our lead or managing placement agent in connection with a potential offering of our common equity up to $20 million.&#160; This agreement expired on May 30




 2013
 an amendment to the above agreement was executed by us and Maxim
 whereas
 in exchange for Maxim&#8217;s services
 we agreed to pay Maxim a cash placement fee equal to 6.6% of the gross proceeds of any such offering
 as well as to reimburse its expenses in the offering up to $100
000.&#160; In addition
 we agreed to issue to Maxim warrants exercisable for a number of shares of common stock equal to 5% of the aggregate number of shares sold in any offering specified in the agreement (excluding any shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of any warrants included in such offering).&#160; At the closing of the public offering on November 18
 2013 we and Maxim agreed to compensation for Maxim of the 6.6% placement fee and a 2% (of gross proceeds) expense allowance adjusted for certain expenses incurred.&#160; The total fees paid to Maxim as a result of the public offering were $95










 2013
 we issued warrants to purchase up to 30
000 shares of common stock in a private placement transaction to a business consultant who assisted us in various product placement matters.&#160; The per share exercise prices of those warrants will be determined based on the market price of the common stock if and when certain sales targets are met; the warrants are exercisable through October 21
 2018.&#160; In addition
 on October 28
 2013
 we issued 220
000 shares of restricted stock in a private placement transaction to a business-consulting firm that assisted us in evaluating various business and financial matters.&#160; Then again on December 3
 2013
 we issued another 550

 2014 and 2013 was $995
683 and $3
534
248
 respectively
 a decrease of $2
538
565 or 71.8%.&#160; The decrease in costs of revenues was primarily attributable to the lower sales volume and our reliance on our outside toll manufacturer to produce sellable product.&#160; Costs that previously were related to our manufacturing of products at our facility have been classified as research and development costs.&#160; During 2013
 we set up an inventory valuation reserve of $742
168 for slow moving inventory within the industrial products division&#160; Since production has been moved to the ANP facility costs are lower as a result of improvements in the production process and increasing production volume.&#160; We believe that this will enable us to allocate our fixed costs over a greater number of finished goods and help reduce the costs of revenues in the future to improve margins.&#160; However







 2014 was $17
987
 or approximately 2% of revenues
 as compared to a gross loss of $2
104
829
 or approximately 147% of revenues for the year ended December 31
 2013.&#160; Gross income or loss reflects a number of factors that can vary from period to period









 direct manufacturing costs that were previously included with Cost of Revenues are now related to our efforts at research and development of new products and processes using different feed stocks
 expanded grade applications and more efficient manufacturing methods.&#160; These costs are being classified as operating expenses for the year ended December 31
 2014 and 2013.&#160; Therefore
 operating expenses for the year ended December 31
 2014 was $5
355
287 (including $1

 we had a working capital deficit of $539

 a decrease from the working capital of $805
195 as of December 31
 2013.&#160; The difference in working capital was primarily because of an increase in accounts payable and the increase in short term borrowings and notes payable during 2014.&#160; As of March 24

 we had a cash balance of $215




 2014 we entered into an agreement with Edward Smith III

 Mr. Smith may elect to convert the aggregate principal balance and accrued interest into shares of our common stock.&#160; The conversion price under the note is $2.25

 the thirty day trailing average closing price of our common stock (the &#8220;Trailing Average Price&#8221;) is below $2.25

 our operations have been funded primarily through the sale of both equity and debt securities.&#160; During 2014
 we raised a total of $2
858
211 in net proceeds from short term borrowings and long and short term notes payable.&#160; We continue to explore additional equity and debt funding however




 our management believes it must improve our cash position through greater and sustainable sales of our product lines and increase the productivity and efficiency of the production process. However
 such an increase would depend on sustained or increased levels of purchases by existing and new customers and actual realization of our customers&#8217; current demand levels
 as well as the completion of changes in our production process










 we agreed to make available to ANP a $500
000 line of credit (which includes $10
000 that we loaned ANP to assist ANP with the purchase of its Waukon
 Iowa facility) at an interest rate of 5.5%.&#160; The line of credit was only permitted to be used by ANP for operating costs
 which excludes capital expenditures of equipment in excess of $5
000.&#160; The loan is to be paid back to us in the form of discounts on production pricing commencing either two years after the first draw by ANP on the line of credit (other than the $10
000 we loaned ANP to assist it with the purchase of its Waukon
 Iowa facility) or the first month after we have ordered 80
000 pounds of product for three consecutive months
 whichever shall occur first.&#160; All of ANP&#8217;s obligations under the line of credit
 as well as the CPA
 are specifically guaranteed by its parent company
 Aveka Inc.&#160; As of December 31
 2014
 all $500
000 to ANP under the line of credit was outstanding.&#160; This extension of credit to ANP had a material adverse impact on our cash resources
 which has required us to seek additional capital resources to fund its operations.&#160; ANP
 in April of 2014
 had begun repaying the line of credit at a rate of $5
000 per month. On January 1

 we had not generated sufficient revenues to meet our cash flow needs.&#160; As a result
 our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.&#160; Although we have generated revenue
 we are still operating at a net loss
 and may continue to incur losses for a period of time.&#160; We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds from our operating or financing activities to support our continued operations.&#160; If we cannot continue as a going concern

 under the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
 in Exchange Act Rules 13a &#8211; 15(e) and 15d &#8211; 15(e)).&#160; Based upon that evaluation
 our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that
 as of the period ended December 31
 2014
 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective (1) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms and (2) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to us
 including our chief executive and chief financial officers
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our conclusion is based primarily on the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting which was disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31






 a control system
 no matter how well conceived and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further
 the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
 and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
 within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty
 and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally
 controls can be circumvented if there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.&#160; Furthermore
 smaller reporting companies face additional limitations. Smaller reporting companies employ fewer individuals and find it difficult to properly segregate duties. Often
 one or two individuals control every aspect of the Company's operation and are in a position to override any system of internal control. Additionally





 as a process designed by
 or under the supervision of
 our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 and effected by our board of directors
 management and other personnel























 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company&#8217;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2014. In making this assessment
 our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.&#160; Based on this assessment
 Management has identified the following three material weaknesses that have caused management to conclude that
 as of December 31
 2014
 our disclosure controls and procedures
 and our internal control over financial reporting









 2014
 we did not maintain effective controls over the control environment.&#160; Specifically we have not developed and effectively communicated to our employees our accounting policies and procedures.&#160; This has resulted in inconsistent practices.&#160;&#160; Since these entity level programs have a pervasive effect across the organization












 2014
 we did not maintain effective controls over financial statement disclosure. Specifically
 controls were not designed and in place to ensure that all disclosures required were originally addressed in our financial statements.&#160;&#160; Accordingly












 2014
 we did not maintain effective controls over financial reporting. Specifically controls were not designed and in place to ensure that the financial impact of certain complex equity and derivative liability transactions were appropriately and correctly reported. The transactions were identified by the auditors and calculated and reported correctly as of December 31

The Black-Scholes model is highly complex and dependent on key estimates by management.

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued an accounting standards update which adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The update requires entities to disclose additional information about reclassification adjustments
 including changes in accumulated other comprehensive income balances by component and significant items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The update was effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2013. The update primarily impacted our disclosures and did not have a material impact on our financial position



 a Similar Tax Loss



 the FASB issued an accounting standards update which requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit
 or portion thereof
 in the statement of financial position as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward or a tax credit carryforward
 with certain exceptions related to availability. The update was effective in the first quarter of 2014. The update did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial position





 the FASB issued an accounting standard which provides new guidance that requires share-based compensation to meet a specific performance target to be achieved in order for employees to become eligible to vest in the awards and that could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. As such
 the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation costs should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period
 the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15













 the FASB issued guidance to improve financial reporting by reducing the cost and complexity associated with the incremental reporting requirements of development stage entities. The amendments in this update remove all incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities
 thereby improving financial reporting by eliminating the cost and complexity associated with providing that information. The amendments in this Update also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities in Topic 810
 Consolidation
 for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk. The amendments to eliminate that exception simplify U.S. GAAP by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the relevance of information provided to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting entities. The elimination of the exception may change the consolidation analysis
 consolidation decision
 and disclosure requirements for a reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the development stage. The amendments related to the elimination of inception-to-date information and the other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915 should be applied retrospectively except for the clarification to Topic 275
 which shall be applied prospectively. For public companies
 those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014





 the FASB issued an accounting standard that requires management to assess an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically
 the standard (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management&#8217;s plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&#8217;s plans
 (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated
 and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The standard in this Update is effective for the annual period ending after December 15
 2016





 the FASB issued new guidance for determining when separation of certain embedded derivative features in a hybrid financial instrument is required. That is
 an entity will continue to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to those of the host contract





 the FASB issued guidance to provide an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity.&#160; After the effective date
 an acquired entity can make an election to apply the guidance to future change-in-control events or to its most recent change-in-control event. However
 if the financial statements for the period in which the most recent change-in-control event occurred already have been issued or made available to be issued
 the application of this guidance would be a change in accounting principle. The amendments in this Update are effective on November 18

 the Company and Steeltown entered into a new Consulting Agreement (which replaces the agreement dated October 28
 2013) in which both the Company and Steeltown substantially agreed to the same services being rendered as the previous agreement.&#160; The Company issued 550

 several investors participated in a warrant exercise program that resulted in the exercise of 1
756
088 warrants into 1
756
088 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock.&#160; The warrant program
 which was open to all holders of $1.50 warrants
 allowed those warrant holders to exercise their warrants for a $1.25 strike price during February 2013; it also required a waiver of the anti-dilution provisions in these warrants until February 28
 2013 so that those provisions would not be triggered by the exercises. The conversion of these warrants raised $2
195
110 of cash for the Company.&#160;&#160; As a result of this warrant modification the Company recognized $4
789
801 of additional expense for previously issued warrants during the period ended March 31
 2013.&#160; The value of the additional expense was based on the fair value of the warrant modification at the date the offer was made to the warrant holders calculated by using the Black-Scholes Model.&#160; The key inputs utilized in this model include the Company&#8217;s stock price on the date of the modification of $2.30

 under which the Company may provide customary indemnifications to purchasers of the Company&#8217;s businesses or assets; (ii) certain real estate leases
 under which the Company may be required to indemnify property owners for environmental and other liabilities
 and other claims arising from the Company&#8217;s use of the applicable premises; and (iii) certain agreements with the Company's officers
 directors and employees
 under which the Company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their employment relationship.&#160; The terms of such obligations vary. Generally
 a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated. Because the obligated amounts of these types of agreements often are not explicitly stated
 the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically
 the Company has not been obligated to make significant payments for these obligations
 and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on its balance sheet as of December 31

608 and accrued interest of $59

 whether they are classified as a liability at each reporting period until the amount is settled and reclassified into equity with changes in fair value recognized in current earnings. At December 31
 2014 and 2013
 the Company had warrants to purchase common stock

 the Company has not been obligated to make significant payments for these obligations

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) issued an accounting standards update which adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The update requires entities to disclose additional information about reclassification adjustments
 including changes in accumulated other comprehensive income balances by component and significant items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The update was effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2013. The update primarily impacted our disclosures and did not have a material impact on our financial position

 a Similar Tax Loss

 the FASB issued an accounting standards update which requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit
 or portion thereof
 in the statement of financial position as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward or a tax credit carryforward
 with certain exceptions related to availability. The update was effective in the first quarter of 2014. The update did not have a material impact on the Company&amp;#8217;s financial position

 the FASB issued an accounting standard which provides new guidance that requires share-based compensation to meet a specific performance target to be achieved in order for employees to become eligible to vest in the awards and that could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. As such
 the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation costs should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period
 the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15


 the FASB issued guidance to improve financial reporting by reducing the cost and complexity associated with the incremental reporting requirements of development stage entities. The amendments in this update remove all incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities
 thereby improving financial reporting by eliminating the cost and complexity associated with providing that information. The amendments in this Update also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities in Topic 810
 Consolidation
 for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk. The amendments to eliminate that exception simplify U.S. GAAP by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the relevance of information provided to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting entities. The elimination of the exception may change the consolidation analysis
 consolidation decision
 and disclosure requirements for a reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the development stage. The amendments related to the elimination of inception-to-date information and the other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915 should be applied retrospectively except for the clarification to Topic 275
 which shall be applied prospectively. For public companies
 those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014

 the FASB issued an accounting standard that requires management to assess an entity&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically
 the standard (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management&amp;#8217;s plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&amp;#8217;s plans
 (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated
 and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The standard in this Update is effective for the annual period ending after December 15
 2016

 the FASB issued new guidance for determining when separation of certain embedded derivative features in a hybrid financial instrument is required. That is
 an entity will continue to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to those of the host contract

 the FASB issued guidance to provide an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity.&amp;#160; After the effective date
 an acquired entity can make an election to apply the guidance to future change-in-control events or to its most recent change-in-control event. However
 if the financial statements for the period in which the most recent change-in-control event occurred already have been issued or made available to be issued
 the application of this guidance would be a change in accounting principle. The amendments in this Update are effective on November 18

 2013
 and also to permanently amend the underlying warrant agreements to reduce the derivative liability the Company incurs as a result of the ratchet provisions in such agreements.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: justify;&gt;On September 18

 provisions are provided at differing rates
 based upon the age of the receivable. In determining these percentages
 management analyzes its historical collection experience and current economic trends. If the historical data the Company uses to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables
 additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected. As of December 31

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) issued an accounting standards update which adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The update requires entities to disclose additional information about reclassification adjustments

The update was effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2013. The update primarily impacted our disclosures and did not have a material impact on our financial position

 a Similar Tax Loss

 the FASB issued an accounting standards update which requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit
 or portion thereof
 in the statement of financial position as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward or a tax credit carryforward
 with certain exceptions related to availability. The update was effective in the first quarter of 2014. The update did not have a material impact on the Company&amp;#8217;s financial position

 the FASB issued an accounting standard which provides new guidance that requires share-based compensation to meet a specific performance target to be achieved in order for employees to become eligible to vest in the awards and that could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. As such
 the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation costs should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period
 the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15


 the FASB issued guidance to improve financial reporting by reducing the cost and complexity associated with the incremental reporting requirements of development stage entities. The amendments in this update remove all incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities
 thereby improving financial reporting by eliminating the cost and complexity associated with providing that information. The amendments in this Update also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities in Topic 810
 Consolidation
 for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk. The amendments to eliminate that exception simplify U.S. GAAP by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the relevance of information provided to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting entities. The elimination of the exception may change the consolidation analysis
 consolidation decision
 and disclosure requirements for a reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the development stage. The amendments related to the elimination of inception-to-date information and the other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915 should be applied retrospectively except for the clarification to Topic 275
 which shall be applied prospectively. For public companies
 those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014

 the FASB issued an accounting standard that requires management to assess an entity&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically
 the standard (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management&amp;#8217;s plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&amp;#8217;s plans
 (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated
 and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The standard in this Update is effective for the annual period ending after December 15
 2016

 the FASB issued new guidance for determining when separation of certain embedded derivative features in a hybrid financial instrument is required. That is
 an entity will continue to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to those of the host contract

 the FASB issued guidance to provide an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity.&amp;#160; After the effective date
 an acquired entity can make an election to apply the guidance to future change-in-control events or to its most recent change-in-control event. However
 if the financial statements for the period in which the most recent change-in-control event occurred already have been issued or made available to be issued
 the application of this guidance would be a change in accounting principle. The amendments in this Update are effective on November 18

 2013 the Company issued 114
944 shares of common stock to its four non-executive directors
 Mark Hershhorn
 Morris Garfinkle
 Brian Israel and Edward Smith (28

 the Company entered into a Consulting Agreement with Steeltown Consulting Group
 LLC
 pursuant to which Steeltown will assist in evaluating various business and financial matters.&amp;#160; The Company issued 220
000 restricted shares of common stock as consideration for the services being rendered in this agreement.&amp;#160; This agreement was scheduled to terminate on January 31
 2014.&amp;#160; On December 3
 2013
 the Company and Steeltown entered into a new Consulting Agreement (which replaces the agreement dated October 28
 2013) in which both the Company and Steeltown substantially agreed to the same services being rendered as the previous agreement.&amp;#160; The Company issued 550

 several investors participated in a warrant exercise program that resulted in the exercise of 1
756
088 warrants into 1
756
088 shares of the Company&amp;#8217;s common stock.&amp;#160; The warrant program
 which was open to all holders of $1.50 warrants
 allowed those warrant holders to exercise their warrants for a $1.25 strike price during February 2013; it also required a waiver of the anti-dilution provisions in these warrants until February 28
 2013 so that those provisions would not be triggered by the exercises. The conversion of these warrants raised $2
195
110 of cash for the Company.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; As a result of this warrant modification the Company recognized $4
789
801 of additional expense for previously issued warrants during the period ended March 31
 2013.&amp;#160; The value of the additional expense was based on the fair value of the warrant modification at the date the offer was made to the warrant holders calculated by using the Black-Scholes Model.&amp;#160; The key inputs utilized in this model include the Company&amp;#8217;s stock price on the date of the modification of $2.30

The Company generally recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 delivery has occurred
 the fee is fixed or determinable
 and collectability is probable. In instances where the final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer
Management of the Company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed
 provisions are provided at differing rates
 based upon the age of the receivable. In determining these percentages
 management analyzes its historical collection experience and current economic trends. If the historical data the Company uses to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables
 additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected. As of December 31
 2014 and 2013
For purposes of the statement of cash flows
 the Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.&#160; There were no cash equivalents as of December 31
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market
 using the first-in
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.&#160; Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.&#160; Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.&#160; Estimated useful lives of five to ten years are used for machinery and equipment
 office equipment and furniture
Intangible assets are carried at the purchased cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets
The amount of current and deferred taxes payable or refundable is recognized as of the date of the financial statements
All derivatives have been recorded on the balance sheet at fair value based on the lattice model calculation. These derivatives
 including embedded derivatives in the Company&#8217;s warrants which have reset provisions to the exercise price and conversion price if the Company issues equity or other derivatives at a price less than the exercise price set forth in such warrants
 are separately valued and accounted for on the Company&#8217;s balance sheet. Fair values for exchange traded securities and derivatives are based on quoted market prices. Where market prices are not readily available
The Company valued the warrants and the conversion features in its formerly outstanding convertible notes and preferred stock using a lattice valuation model
The Company&#8217;s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 inventory
 accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The estimated fair value of cash

The Company utilizes various types of financing to fund its business needs
 including convertible debt with warrants attached. The Company reviews its warrants and conversion features of securities issued as to whether they are freestanding or contain an embedded derivative and
 if so
 whether they are classified as a liability at each reporting period until the amount is settled and reclassified into equity with changes in fair value recognized in current earnings. At December 31
 2014 and 2013
 the Company had warrants to purchase common stock
Level three &#8212; Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions
Determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter. The Company&#8217;s only asset or liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis is its derivative liability associated with warrants to purchase common stock and preferred stock. The fair value of the derivative liability at December 31
 2014 and 2013 was $20
166 and $95
049
 respectively.&#160; The gain on derivative liability for the twelve months ended December 31
 2014 was $74

Basic net income (loss) per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding and
 when diluted
The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payment awards made to employees and directors
 including stock options
 restricted stock and employee stock purchases related to employee stock purchase plans
 on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite service periods.&#160; We estimate the fair value of each share-based award using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes model is highly complex and dependent on key estimates by management. The estimates with the greatest degree of subjective judgment are the estimated lives of the stock-based awards and the estimated volatility of our stock price. The Company recognized pre-tax compensation expense related to stock options of $935
097 and $2

 2014 and 2013
The Company has entered into a custom processing agreement with a vendor in order to provide the Company with a partner for future manufacturing initiatives. The Company has agreed to make available a $500
000 note receivable to the vendor at a 5.5% interest rate. The vendor may not draw down more than $75
The Company capitalizes distributions to the vendor related to this agreement upon disbursement based on this value to be applied towards discounts on future product purchases. Interest on the outstanding advances are recorded to interest income and capitalized to the note receivable account
On March 28
 2014 the Company agreed to an amendment to the custom processing agreement relating to the repayment of the note receivable advances plus interest.&#160; Commencing on April 1
 2014
 Aveka Nutra Processing began paying the Company $5
On January 1
 2015 the Company and ANP entered into a new Custom Processing Agreement (the &#8220;new CPA&#8221;) replacing the Agreement from October 17
 2011.&#160; The term of the new CPA is one year.&#160; The CPA automatically renews at the end of the initial term for an additional two year term unless either party provides written notice to the other within the specified time frame.&#160; The new CPA provides that the Company and ANP mutually agree to release each other from the original Agreement.&#160; Also agreed to was the Company absolution to ANP of any responsibility to pay the balance of line of credit in the amount of $459
608 and accrued interest of $59
398.&#160; ANP further agreed to release the Company from any responsibility to pay $359
The CPA further stipulates that ANP will provide custom product processing services in the future on an order-by-order basis provided ANP has the available capacity to produce the Company&#8217;s products.&#160; The Company agrees to give ANP purchase orders for a minimum of 40
As a result of the new CPA
 the Company has recognized a settlement loss of $159
293 as of December 31
In February 2013
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued an accounting standards update which adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The update requires entities to disclose additional information about reclassification adjustments
 including changes in accumulated other comprehensive income balances by component and significant items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The update was effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2013. The update primarily impacted our disclosures and did not have a material impact on our financial position
Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward
 a Similar Tax Loss
In July 2013
 the FASB issued an accounting standards update which requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit
 or portion thereof
 in the statement of financial position as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward or a tax credit carryforward
 with certain exceptions related to availability. The update was effective in the first quarter of 2014. The update did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial position
In June 2014
 the FASB issued an accounting standard which provides new guidance that requires share-based compensation to meet a specific performance target to be achieved in order for employees to become eligible to vest in the awards and that could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. As such
 the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation costs should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period
 the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15
Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
In June 2014
 the FASB issued guidance to improve financial reporting by reducing the cost and complexity associated with the incremental reporting requirements of development stage entities. The amendments in this update remove all incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities
 thereby improving financial reporting by eliminating the cost and complexity associated with providing that information. The amendments in this Update also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities in Topic 810
 Consolidation
 for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk. The amendments to eliminate that exception simplify U.S. GAAP by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the relevance of information provided to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting entities. The elimination of the exception may change the consolidation analysis
 consolidation decision
 and disclosure requirements for a reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the development stage. The amendments related to the elimination of inception-to-date information and the other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915 should be applied retrospectively except for the clarification to Topic 275
 which shall be applied prospectively. For public companies
 those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014
In August 2014
 the FASB issued an accounting standard that requires management to assess an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically
 the standard (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management&#8217;s plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&#8217;s plans
 (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated
 and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The standard in this Update is effective for the annual period ending after December 15
 2016
In November 2014
 the FASB issued new guidance for determining when separation of certain embedded derivative features in a hybrid financial instrument is required. That is
 an entity will continue to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to those of the host contract
In November 2014
 the FASB issued guidance to provide an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity.&#160; After the effective date
 an acquired entity can make an election to apply the guidance to future change-in-control events or to its most recent change-in-control event. However
 if the financial statements for the period in which the most recent change-in-control event occurred already have been issued or made available to be issued
 the application of this guidance would be a change in accounting principle. The amendments in this Update are effective on November 18
 2014.&#160; The adoption of ASU 2014-17 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

The Company from time to time enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require the Company to indemnify parties against third party claims. These contracts primarily relate to: (i) divestiture agreements
 under which the Company may provide customary indemnifications to purchasers of the Company&#8217;s businesses or assets; (ii) certain real estate leases
 under which the Company may be required to indemnify property owners for environmental and other liabilities
 and other claims arising from the Company&#8217;s use of the applicable premises; and (iii) certain agreements with the Company's officers
 directors and employees
 under which the Company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their employment relationship.&#160; The terms of such obligations vary. Generally
 a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated. Because the obligated amounts of these types of agreements often are not explicitly stated
 the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically
 the Company has not been obligated to make significant payments for these obligations
 and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on its balance sheet as of December 31
In general
 the Company offers a one-year warranty for most of the products it sells.&#160; To date
 the Company has not incurred any material costs associated with these warranties.

The Company generally recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 delivery has occurred
 the fee is fixed or determinable
 and collectability is probable. In instances where the final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer
 revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. No provisions were established for estimated product returns and allowances based on the Company&#8217;s historical experience.


        
Management of the Company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed
 provisions are provided at differing rates
 based upon the age of the receivable. In determining these percentages
 management analyzes its historical collection experience and current economic trends. If the historical data the Company uses to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables
 additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected. As of December 31
 2014 and 2013
 the allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.


        
For purposes of the statement of cash flows
 the Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.&#160; There were no cash equivalents as of December 31
 2014 and 2013.


        
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market
 using the first-in
 first-out method.&#160; The Company follows standard costing methods for manufactured products.


        
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.&#160; Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.&#160; Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.&#160; Estimated useful lives of five to ten years are used for machinery and equipment
 office equipment and furniture
 and automobile. Estimated useful lives of up to five years are used for computer equipment and related software. Depreciation and amortization of leasehold improvements are computed using the term of the lease.


        
Intangible assets are carried at the purchased cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets
 generally from fifteen to twenty years.


        
        


        
The amount of current and deferred taxes payable or refundable is recognized as of the date of the financial statements
 utilizing currently enacted tax laws and rates.&#160; Deferred tax expenses or benefits are recognized in the financial statements for the changes in deferred tax liabilities or assets between years.


        
All derivatives have been recorded on the balance sheet at fair value based on the lattice model calculation. These derivatives
 including embedded derivatives in the Company&#8217;s warrants which have reset provisions to the exercise price and conversion price if the Company issues equity or other derivatives at a price less than the exercise price set forth in such warrants
 are separately valued and accounted for on the Company&#8217;s balance sheet. Fair values for exchange traded securities and derivatives are based on quoted market prices. Where market prices are not readily available
 fair values are determined using market based pricing models incorporating readily observable market data and requiring judgment and estimates.


        
The Company valued the warrants and the conversion features in its formerly outstanding convertible notes and preferred stock using a lattice valuation model
 with the assistance of a valuation consultant. The lattice model values these instruments based on a probability weighted discounted cash flow model. The Company uses the model to develop a set of potential scenarios. Probabilities of each scenario occurring during the remaining term of the instruments are determined based on management's projections and the expert&#8217;s calculations. These probabilities are used to create a cash flow projection over the term of the instruments and determine the probability that the projected cash flow will be achieved. A discounted weighted average cash flow for each scenario is then calculated and compared to the discounted cash flow of the instruments without the compound embedded derivative in order to determine a value for the compound embedded derivative.


        
The Company&#8217;s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 inventory
 accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The estimated fair value of cash
 accounts receivable
The Company utilizes various types of financing to fund its business needs
 including convertible debt with warrants attached. The Company reviews its warrants and conversion features of securities issued as to whether they are freestanding or contain an embedded derivative and
 if so
 whether they are classified as a liability at each reporting period until the amount is settled and reclassified into equity with changes in fair value recognized in current earnings. At December 31
 2014 and 2013
 the Company had warrants to purchase common stock
Level three &#8212; Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions
Determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter. The Company&#8217;s only asset or liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis is its derivative liability associated with warrants to purchase common stock and preferred stock. The fair value of the derivative liability at December 31
 2014 and 2013 was $20
166 and $95
049
 respectively.&#160; The gain on derivative liability for the twelve months ended December 31

Basic net income (loss) per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding and

 potential shares from options and warrants to purchase common stock using the treasury stock method. Diluted net loss per common share does not differ from basic net loss per common share since potential shares of common stock are anti-dilutive for all periods presented.


        
        


        
The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payment awards made to employees and directors
 including stock options
 restricted stock and employee stock purchases related to employee stock purchase plans
 on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite service periods.&#160; We estimate the fair value of each share-based award using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes model is highly complex and dependent on key estimates by management. The estimates with the greatest degree of subjective judgment are the estimated lives of the stock-based awards and the estimated volatility of our stock price. The Company recognized pre-tax compensation expense related to stock options of $935
097 and $2
318
355 for the years ended December 31
 2014 and 2013
 respectively.


        
The Company has entered into a custom processing agreement with a vendor in order to provide the Company with a partner for future manufacturing initiatives. The Company has agreed to make available a $500
000 note receivable to the vendor at a 5.5% interest rate. The vendor may not draw down more than $75
The Company capitalizes distributions to the vendor related to this agreement upon disbursement based on this value to be applied towards discounts on future product purchases. Interest on the outstanding advances are recorded to interest income and capitalized to the note receivable account
On March 28
 2014 the Company agreed to an amendment to the custom processing agreement relating to the repayment of the note receivable advances plus interest.&#160; Commencing on April 1
 2014
 Aveka Nutra Processing began paying the Company $5
On January 1
 2015 the Company and ANP entered into a new Custom Processing Agreement (the &#8220;new CPA&#8221;) replacing the Agreement from October 17
 2011.&#160; The term of the new CPA is one year.&#160; The CPA automatically renews at the end of the initial term for an additional two year term unless either party provides written notice to the other within the specified time frame.&#160; The new CPA provides that the Company and ANP mutually agree to release each other from the original Agreement.&#160; Also agreed to was the Company absolution to ANP of any responsibility to pay the balance of line of credit in the amount of $459
608 and accrued interest of $59
398.&#160; ANP further agreed to release the Company from any responsibility to pay $359
The CPA further stipulates that ANP will provide custom product processing services in the future on an order-by-order basis provided ANP has the available capacity to produce the Company&#8217;s products.&#160; The Company agrees to give ANP purchase orders for a minimum of 40
As a result of the new CPA
 the Company has recognized a settlement loss of $159
293 as of December 31
 2014.


        
In February 2013
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued an accounting standards update which adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The update requires entities to disclose additional information about reclassification adjustments
 including changes in accumulated other comprehensive income balances by component and significant items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The update was effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2013. The update primarily impacted our disclosures and did not have a material impact on our financial position
Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward
 a Similar Tax Loss
In July 2013
 the FASB issued an accounting standards update which requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit
 or portion thereof
 in the statement of financial position as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward or a tax credit carryforward
 with certain exceptions related to availability. The update was effective in the first quarter of 2014. The update did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial position
In June 2014
 the FASB issued an accounting standard which provides new guidance that requires share-based compensation to meet a specific performance target to be achieved in order for employees to become eligible to vest in the awards and that could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. As such
 the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation costs should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period
 the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15
Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
In June 2014
 the FASB issued guidance to improve financial reporting by reducing the cost and complexity associated with the incremental reporting requirements of development stage entities. The amendments in this update remove all incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities
 thereby improving financial reporting by eliminating the cost and complexity associated with providing that information. The amendments in this Update also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities in Topic 810
 Consolidation
 for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk. The amendments to eliminate that exception simplify U.S. GAAP by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the relevance of information provided to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting entities. The elimination of the exception may change the consolidation analysis
 consolidation decision
 and disclosure requirements for a reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the development stage. The amendments related to the elimination of inception-to-date information and the other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915 should be applied retrospectively except for the clarification to Topic 275
 which shall be applied prospectively. For public companies
 those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014
In August 2014
 the FASB issued an accounting standard that requires management to assess an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically
 the standard (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management&#8217;s plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&#8217;s plans
 (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated
 and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The standard in this Update is effective for the annual period ending after December 15
 2016
In November 2014
 the FASB issued new guidance for determining when separation of certain embedded derivative features in a hybrid financial instrument is required. That is
 an entity will continue to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to those of the host contract
In November 2014
 the FASB issued guidance to provide an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity.&#160; After the effective date
 an acquired entity can make an election to apply the guidance to future change-in-control events or to its most recent change-in-control event. However
 if the financial statements for the period in which the most recent change-in-control event occurred already have been issued or made available to be issued
 the application of this guidance would be a change in accounting principle. The amendments in this Update are effective on November 18
 2014.&#160; The adoption of ASU 2014-17 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In connection with certain private placements of the Company&#8217;s securities (the &#8220;Registrable Securities&#8221;) effected in 2008
 the Company entered into registration rights agreements (the &#8220;RRA&#8221;) that required the Company to file a registration statement covering the Registrable Securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission no later than thirty days after the final closing as contemplated in the Private Placement Memorandum for the 2008 offering (the &#8220;Filing Deadline&#8221;)
 which the Company did not meet. Under the terms of the RRA
 as partial compensation
 required to make pro rata payments to each Investor in an amount equal to 1.5% of the aggregate amount invested by such Investor for each 30-day period or pro rata for any portion thereof following the Filing Deadline for which no registration statement was filed.&#160; We obtained a release and waiver of the amounts due from almost all of the 2008 investors.&#160;&#160; Under the terms of the RRA
 we potentially owe
 and have recognized as liquidated damages
 $36
178 relating to holders from whom we did not receive waivers.

 2011
 the Company entered into a Custom Processing Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with AVEKA Nutra Processing
 LLC (&#8220;ANP&#8221;)
 part of the AVEKA Group
The Agreement provides that ANP will perform certain services related to the Company&#8217;s dietary fiber product
 including manufacturing
 processing
 packaging and storage/warehousing for an initial term of three years.&#160; The Agreement automatically renews at the end of the initial term for an additional two year term unless either party provides written notice to the other within the specified time frame.&#160; &#160;&#160; Production pursuant to the Agreement began in November 2012 and is still in the process of being ramped up to contractual minimum production volumes of 40
000 pounds per month and average volumes of 100
000 pounds per month
 with the ability to increase future production volume to potentially as much as 1
000
In addition
 the Company agreed to make available to ANP a $500
000 line of credit (which includes $10
000 that the Company loaned ANP to assist it with the purchase of its Waukon
 Iowa facility) at an interest rate of 5.5%.&#160; The line of credit is only permitted to be used by ANP for operating costs which excludes capital expenditures of equipment in excess of $5
000.&#160; ANP may not draw down on the line of credit more than $75
000 in any given thirty day period.&#160; The loan is to be paid back to the Company in the form of discounts on production pricing commencing either two years after the first draw by ANP on the line of credit (other than the $10
000 the Company loaned ANP to assist it with the purchase of its Waukon
 Iowa facility) or the first month after the Company has ordered 80
000 pounds of product for three consecutive months
 whichever shall occur first.&#160; All of ANP&#8217;s obligations under the line of credit
 as well as the Agreement
 are specifically guaranteed by its parent company

 2011.&#160; The term of the new CPA will be one year.&#160; The CPA automatically renews at the end of the initial term for an additional two year term unless either party provides written notice to the other within the specified time frame.&#160; The new CPA provides that the Company and ANP mutually agree to release each other from the original Agreement. .&#160; Also agreed to was the Company absolution to ANP of any responsibility to pay the balance of line of credit in the amount of $459
608 and accrued interest of $59
398.&#160; ANP further agreed to release the Company from any responsibility to pay $359
The CPA further stipulates that ANP will provide custom product processing services in the future on an order-by-order basis provided ANP has the available capacity to produce the Company&#8217;s products.&#160; The Company agrees to give ANP purchase orders for a minimum of 40
As a result of the new CPA
 the Company has recognized a settlement loss of $159
293 as of December 31
 2014.

 2014 and 2013 may be subject to IRS audit.

For the twelve months ended December 31
 2013
 the Company issued 5
893
887 shares of common stock as a result of the exercise of warrants both on a cash and cashless basis. The impact of these issuances to the related embedded derivative liabilities was a decrease to the derivative liability and increase to additional paid in capital for $2
489
552 on the exercise dates.&#160; Finally
 the Company issued 3
859
697 shares of common stock as a result of the conversion of Series II Convertible Preferred Stock and accrued dividends.&#160; The impact of these conversions to the related embedded derivative liabilities was a decrease to the derivative liability and increase to additional paid in capital for $2
761
As a result of the August 20
 2013 transaction with Brightline Ventures I
 pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions in the $1.50 Warrants that were not exercised as part of the Cashless Exercise Program
 the Company reduced the exercise price of those warrants to $1.25 per share and adjusted the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of those warrants such that for every five warrants owned
 each remaining holder of $1.50 Warrants received one additional warrant with an exercise price of $1.25.&#160; There were a total of 11
880
047 warrants that were not exercised as part of the Cashless Exercise Program.&#160; In addition
 the warrant holders agreed to permanently waive the full reset feature contained in the original warrant.&#160; As a result
 the Company issued an aggregate of 2
376
009 additional warrants at an exercise price of $1.25 per share (including 2
316
597 additional warrants that were issued to Brightline Ventures I) to the holders of $1.50 Warrants that were not exercised as part of the Cashless Exercise Program and recognized a settlement to additional paid in capital for the related derivative liability of $1
712
On November 18
 2013
 the Company completed a public offering of 1
866
667 shares of common stock at a price of $0.75 per share along with warrants to purchase 1
400
000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share.&#160; The warrants were issued with a full reset feature which was valued at $57
729 at issuance and netted with the $966
736 gain recognized on the derivative liability for the year ended December 31
 2013.

 several investors participated in a warrant exercise program that resulted in the exercise of 1
756
088 warrants into 1
756
088 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock.&#160; The warrant program
 which was open to all holders of $1.50 warrants
 allowed those warrant holders to exercise their warrants for a $1.25 strike price during February 2013; it also required a waiver of the anti-dilution provisions in these warrants until February 28
 2013 so that those provisions would not be triggered by the exercises. The conversion of these warrants raised $2

110 of cash for the Company.&#160;&#160; As a result of this warrant modification the Company recognized $4
789
801 of additional expense for previously issued warrants during the period ended March 31
