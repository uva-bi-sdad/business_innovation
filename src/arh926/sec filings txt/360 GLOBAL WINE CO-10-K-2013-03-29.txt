 the Company
has suffered significant losses and will require additional capital to develop its business until the Company either (1) achieves
a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flows from operations; or (2) obtains additional financing necessary to
support its working capital requirements. In addition
 the Company has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in order to reorganize
and work out its debt arrangements. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a
going concern. Management&rsquo;s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 13. The financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 &quot;360 Global&quot;
 the &quot;Debtor&quot; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) is a publicly traded investment
holding company that has invested in a number of diverse business activities and that has targeted a number of industries for future
investment. 360 Global is domiciled in the state of Nevada and its corporate headquarters are located in Los Angeles
 CA.

 2007 the Company filed for Chapter
11 protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy code to reorganize. It subsequently disposed of its wholly owned operating subsidiary
360 Viansa LLC
 and all other assets as part of the

Plan&rdquo;
 &quot;Viansa POR&quot;) - as approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Nevada (the &ldquo;Bankruptcy
Court&rdquo;).


 2007 360 Viansa
 LLC was sold to
Laurus Master Fund
 Ltd. (&ldquo;Laurus&rdquo;). In March
 2008
 360 Global sold the Texas Property to the City of Granite Shoals
and the Christ Redeemer Fellowship. Under the Viansa plans all funds except for a residual interest of $250
000 went to the 360
Global trust for the benefit of the creditors The $250
000 was designated for payment of professional fees under the bankruptcy
plan and subsequently distributed in February
 2009.

 2008
 360 Global&rsquo;s Disclosure
Statement and Plan of Reorganization (&ldquo;Global Plan&rdquo;) was confirmed by United States Bankruptcy Court for the District
of Nevada and can be found as Exhibit 34.1 to this document.


 the Company&rsquo;s
business plan is made up of two activities. First

necessary to prepare and file updated financial statements and annual and quarterly reports with the SEC and any other governmental
organizations
 in order to re-establish Reorganized Global as a fully reporting public company and re-list its common stock on
a nationally recognized stock exchange or market quotation system.


 Reorganized
Global&rsquo;s plan is to complete the following SEC filings (among other filings and reports)
 which Reorganized Global will complete

acquire an operating business or effect a merger or acquisition
 or capital stock exchange

 or other similar
business combination with an operating business. The business going forward shall not be inconsistent with the business prior to
filing for Chapter 11. However
 Reorganized Global is not necessarily limited to a particular industry. Nevertheless
 management
of Global has initially focused on the same sectors. As of the first quarter of 2012
 efforts have been limited to exploring financing
and acquisition opportunities with the intent to maximize the value of the business for Reorganized Global&rsquo;s Creditors and
new equity interest holders. Global&rsquo;s efforts in identifying a prospective target business have been ongoing since January
2008. Global has examined over 100 business opportunities including a wide range of detailed discussions with financing and management
partners.

herein have been prepared by 360 Global
 and reflect
 in the opinion of management
 all adjustments necessary to present fairly
the financial information for the Company. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in financial statements
 prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;).



NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES





in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&quot;GAAP&quot;) requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods reported.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.


that are based on management's best estimates and judgments. The most significant estimates are the valuation of financial instrument
derivatives and the related original issue discount and beneficial conversion features identified in the issuance of convertible
debt instruments
 the valuation of the net assets of discontinued operations
 the valuation of Company issued securities used as
employee compensation and for services
 the valuation of securities used in business acquisitions
 the allocation of the purchase
price in business combinations
 the determination of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable
 the valuation reserve
for inventories
 and the valuation reserve for the deferred income tax asset The Company's estimation process requires assumptions
to be made about future events and conditions
 and as such
 is inherently subjective and uncertain. Actual results could differ
materially from the Company's estimates.





Historically
 the Company&rsquo;s primary streams of revenue include the sale and disposal of investments as well as revenue from
operations. Investment revenue is recognized in the period earned. Revenues for operations consist primarily of sales and are recognized
upon shipment.

ASC 260
 &quot;Earnings
per Share&quot;
 the Company calculates basic and diluted net loss per share using the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the periods presented. Net losses were incurred in certain of the periods presented
 and in those instances
did&nbsp;not include the effect of potentially dilutive common stock equivalents in the diluted net loss per share calculation
as their effect would be anti-dilutive. Potentially dilutive common stock equivalents would include the common stock issuable based
upon conversion features provided in debt security instruments and the exercise of warrants.

claims

 Accounting for Contingencies
the Company makes a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the
loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company believes it has adequate provisions for all such matters that have come to the attention
of the Company. The Company reviews these provisions at least quarterly and adjusts these provisions to reflect the impacts of
negotiations
 settlements
 rulings
 advice of legal counsel
 and other information and events pertaining to a particular case.
Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However
 the Company believes that it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters
pending against it. Nevertheless
 it is possible that cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular
period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these contingencies.


 2007 the Company filed a voluntary
petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. We continued to operate our business
as &ldquo;debtors-in-possession&rdquo; under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. As of the date of the Chapter 11 filing
 virtually all pending litigation
was stayed.


by the court in December
 2008 all liability under such lawsuits was transferred to the Global trust. The Company is not aware
of any other material legal proceedings against the Company.


    
    





 2011 and 2010
there were no related party transactions.





with 
. Under ASC 740
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based
on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax
rate. SFAS No. 109 requires that the net deferred tax asset be reduced by a valuation allowance if
 based on the weight of available
evidence
 it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company continues
to reduce its net deferred tax assets by a 100% valuation allowance.

and other accrued expenses and other current assets and liabilities are carried at amounts which reasonably approximate their fair
values because of the relatively short maturity of those instruments.

 to fund and implement this Plan. The sale of up
to 100% of the equity in the Reorganized Viansa will be conducted through an orderly sale process
 including the right of secured
creditors to submit credit bids
 to be conducted at the Confirmation Hearing

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
VIANSA&rsquo;S BACKGROUND
 OWNERSHIP
 AND OPERATING HISTORY

to the Petition Date is described in the Omnibus Statement of Facts in Support of First Day Motions filed on March 9
 2007
 a copy
of which is attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;1.&rdquo; As discussed therein
 Viansa and its parent
 Global
 experienced a significant
financial crisis derived
 in part
 from their dispute with Kirkland Knightsbridge
 LLC (&ldquo;KKLLC&rdquo;)
 with whom Global
entered into a joint venture in 2004. KKLLC filed for bankruptcy protection in September of 2006
 at which time KKLLC was in possession
of substantial inventory of Viansa.

 of particular
importance in Viansa&rsquo;s history is its use of certain wine-making equipment (the &ldquo;GE Equipment&rdquo;) in connection
with its business operations. Prior to Global&rsquo;s acquisition of Viansa from Viansa Winery
 a California limited partnership
(&ldquo;Prior Owner&rdquo;) in 2005
 Prior Owner&rsquo;s GE Equipment was being leased from General Electric Capital Corporation
directly and as successor-in-interest to Mellon US Leasing (&ldquo;GE&rdquo;). Upon the acquisition of the winery
 the lease was
not assigned to Viansa. Instead
 Former Owner continued to be the lessee of the GE Equipment from GE and Viansa utilized such equipment
and continues to utilize such equipment
 pursuant to a Consent To Use Agreement (the &ldquo;Consent Agreement&rdquo;) with Former
Owner
 a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;4&rdquo;. Paragraph 4 of the Consent Agreement provides that if a default
occurs and GE provides notice of such default
 then Viansa will become the lessee

    
    


as a lessee. In September 2006
 default notices
 copies of which are collectively attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;5&rdquo;
 were
sent to Viansa at its regular business address. It is Viansa&rsquo;s position that
 to the extent that Viansa did not already have
successor interest in the GE Equipment to that of Former Owner
 such interest was acquired as a result of the default notices and
the Consent Agreement. Viansa has been advised that Former Owner and/or GE disagree with the foregoing characterization. The Former
Owner has indicated that it might file a motion for relief from stay with regard to the GE Equipment to be heard at or immediately
following the Confirmation Hearing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


 2007 (the &ldquo;Petition Date&rdquo;)
the Debtors each filed a voluntary petition for relief with the Bankruptcy Court under the Bankruptcy Code. On March 23
 2007
this Court issued an Order granting joint administration of the Cases.

 KKLLC
filed its motion to transfer venue of the cases to Northern District of California
 Santa Rosa Division. The Debtors
 as well as
numerous creditors
 opposed the motion
 which was eventually denied by this Court.

on April 23
 2007.

 2007 the Bankruptcy Court entered
the Laurus Cash Collateral Order and the DIP Order
 and on July 27
 2007 the Bankruptcy Court entered the Gryphon Cash Collateral
Order. Pursuant to these orders
 Debtors are continuing to operate pursuant to terms approved by Croesus
 Laurus
 Gryphon
 and
the Bankruptcy Court.

 2007
 the Bankruptcy Court entered
an Order Granting Motion for Authority to Pay Grape Grower&rsquo;s Statutory Liens
 and such liens were paid with the proceeds
of the DIP Loan. Viansa has made all required payments to its grape growers in accordance with this Court&rsquo;s order.

Court approval of a settlement with KKLLC
 which was approved by order entered on August 16
 2007. Pursuant to the settlement
all litigation (including appeals)

    
    


 Viansa has obtained a turnover
of its wine inventory (and related items) which were maintained in KKLLC&rsquo;s possession to the exclusion of Viansa.



Services to assist with marketing Viansa&rsquo;s business; and have employed Capital City Sotheby&rsquo;s International Realty
to assist with the marketing of the Texas Property.

 Ltd. as
its financial advisor in connection with these Cases.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Viansa&rsquo;s exclusive periods to file plan(s) of reorganization and obtain acceptances
thereof
 without any extension
 would have expired on July 5
 2007 and September 3
 2007
 respectively. Viansa filed a motion
and the Bankruptcy Court entered and order
 extending its exclusive periods to file plan(s) of reorganization and obtain acceptances
thereof through and including October 3
 2007 and December 2
 2007
 respectively
 without prejudice to seek further extensions
of the foregoing periods.

Reports with the Bankruptcy Court. Creditors may refer to these reports for detailed information regarding Viansa&rsquo;s post-petition
financial operations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


of its winery and tasting room located in Sonoma
 California
 along with related assets (including real property
 personal property
inventory
 and wine club). A detailed description of Viansa&rsquo;s assets is contained in Viansa&rsquo;s Amended Schedules filed
on May 11
 2007 in Case No. BK-S-07-50206-GWZ as docket nos. 76-80; and 92-84. Viansa believes that these assets may have a value
ranging from $45 to $70 million. While the Debtors have been marketing Viansa&rsquo;s business for a cash infusion or sale
 to
date
 no offer has been received. As a result
 the valuation of the Assets is uncertain.

in Exhibit &ldquo;2&rdquo; attached hereto. Viansa&rsquo;s secured liabilities include amounts owed to Croesus
 Laurus and Gryphon
which aggregate in excess of $57 million. New Vine asserts a security interest in inventory and a Claim of approximately $440
000.
There are asserted Secured

    
    


 Viansa believes

granted by the Bankruptcy Court. There are several equipment and vehicle leases
 and Secured and Priority tax Claims. The total
pre-petition Claims asserted are approximately as follows:

the Priority Tax Claims amount to approximately $635
000. At the option of Reorganized Viansa
 Allowed Priority Tax Claims shall
be paid either (1) in cash on the Effective Date; or (2) deferred cash payments
 in equal quarterly installments
 over the period
ending five (5) years from the Petition Date
 with interest to accrue at the federal interest rate
 estimated to be 6% per annum
(or such other interest rate as agreed to by Viansa and the holder of such Allowed Priority Tax Claim
 or such rate as determined
by the Bankruptcy Court to be appropriate

 consists of the New Vine Secured Claim. Unless already paid
 on the Effective
Date
 New Vine shall receive a Cash payment in the amount of $417
000 in full and complete satisfaction of the New Vine Secured
Claim. This Class is impaired and entitled to vote on this Plan. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 consists of the Allowed Claims of holders of statutory liens
 other than Priority
Tax Claims and the New Vine Secured Claim
 but including Secured Claims for real or personal property taxes. Viansa believes that
the only such Claims consist of real property taxes in the approximate amount of $20
000. Any Class 2 Claims which were filed prior
to the Bar Date
 and delinquent real property taxes of record
 shall be paid in full on the Effective Date. Any Class 2 Claims
which were not filed prior to the Bar Date shall be disallowed. Since all Allowed Class 2 Claims will be paid in full on the Effective
Date
 Viansa believes that this Class is unimpaired and
 therefore
 not entitled to vote on this Plan.

    
    


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 consists of the Croesus Secured Claim. Upon the closing of the sale
 Croesus
shall be paid in full
 on the Effective Date
 from the proceeds of the sale
 subject to the payment of the Carve Out. However
if Laurus is the Successful Bidder
 the Croesus Class 3 Claim shall remain in place with the Reorganized Viansa. Based on the fact
that this is a post-petition administrative obligation
 this Class is not entitled to vote on this Plan.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 consists of the Laurus Secured Claim. Upon the closing of the sale
 Laurus
shall be paid in full
 on the Effective Date
 from the proceeds of the sale
 subject to the payment of the Carve Out. This Class
is impaired and entitled to vote on this Plan.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 consists of the Gryphon Secured Claim. To the extent the sale results in payment
of cash in a sufficient amount for payment of the Carve-Out and Classes 1
 2
 3 and 4 claims
 the balance of the sale proceeds
shall be paid to Gryphon until the Gryphon Secured Claim is paid in full. To the extent not paid as a Class 5 Secured Claim
 any
balance owed to Gryphon shall be treated as an Unsecured Claim. For purposes of voting
 the Gryphon Secured Claim shall be estimated
pursuant to 11 U.S.C. &sect;502(c)(1) at $1; and Gryphon shall be permitted to vote the balance of its Claim as either a Class
11 or Class 12 Unsecured Creditor
 at the election of Gryphon. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 consists of the Secured Claim asserted by Dell Financial Services
 LP (&ldquo;DFS&rdquo;)
which is purportedly secured by certain computer equipment. The Successful Bidder shall have the option of paying such Secured
Claim pursuant to the terms of the pre-petition agreement between Viansa and DFS
 or relinquishing the collateral to DFS in full
and complete satisfaction of its Secured Claim. This Class is unimpaired and
 therefore
 not entitled to vote on this Plan.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 consists of the Secured Claims asserted by General Motors Acceptance Corporation
(&ldquo;GMAC&rdquo;)
 which are secured by certain motor vehicles. The Successful Bidder shall have the option
 on a contract by
contract basis
 of paying such Secured Claims pursuant to the terms of the pre-petition agreement between Viansa and GMAC
 or surrendering
the collateral to GMAC in full and complete satisfaction of its Secured Claims. This Class is unimpaired and
 therefore
 not entitled
to vote on this Plan.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 consists of the Secured Claim asserted by Key Equipment Finance (&ldquo;KEF&rdquo;)
which is purportedly secured by certain wine-making equipment. The Successful Bidder shall have the option of paying such Secured
Claim pursuant to the terms of the pre-petition agreement between Viansa and KEF
 or relinquishing the collateral to KEF in full
and complete satisfaction of its Secured Claim. This Class is unimpaired and
 therefore
 not entitled to vote on this Plan.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 consists of the Secured Claims of US Bancorp (&ldquo;USB&rdquo;)
 which are
purportedly secured by certain office equipment. The Successful Bidder shall have the option of paying such Secured Claims pursuant
to the terms of the pre-petition agreement between Viansa and USB
 or relinquishing the collateral to USB in full and complete
satisfaction of its Secured Claims. This Class is unimpaired and
 therefore
 not entitled to vote on this Plan.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 consists of all GE (including claims assigned to GE by Mellon Bank)
 which
are purportedly secured by the GE Equipment. Viansa believes that the agreements with GE (the &ldquo;GE Agreements&rdquo;) may
be interpreted as either executory contracts or disguised security agreement and
 if the latter
 may not be properly perfected
resulting in a general unsecured claim. The Successful Bidder shall step into the shoes of Viansa and shall have the right to seek
a determination that the GE Agreements are disguised security

 requiring payment of the secured claim pursuant to 11
U.S.C. &sect; 506
 and not executory contracts requiring cure payments pursuant to 11 U.S.C. &sect; 365
 and shall retain all other
claims and defenses with regard to the GE Agreements and Claims related to GE
 including
 but not limited
 any avoidance rights
under the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 any Potential Bidder and Qualified Bidder are advised to conduct their own analysis
of the facts and circumstances surrounding the transactions with GE
 including review of the attached Consent Agreement and default
notices
 as well as the underlying GE Agreements. The Successful Bidder shall state its intention with regard to GE on or before
the conclusion of the Confirmation Hearing. 

Bidder designates that it seeks to treat the GE Agreements as executory contracts
 assume such GE Agreements
 Successful
Bidder (other than Laurus) shall set aside
 or show evidence of
 sufficient funds to pay the cure in accordance with Exhibit &ldquo;3&rdquo;
hereto
 unless otherwise ordered by the Court. In such case
 GE&rsquo;s Claim shall not be a classified Claim and shall not be
treated as a classified Claim under the Plan.

 reject such GE Agreements
 GE&rsquo;s
lease rejection Claims shall be treated as Class 11 or Class 12 General Unsecured Claims
 at the election of GE. In such case
GE&rsquo;s Claim shall not be treated as a Class 10 Secured Claim under the Plan.

Bidder designates that it intends to treat the GE Agreements as disguised security agreements and that the Successful Bidder seeks
to surrender the GE Equipment to GE
 then on the Effective Date
 the GE Equipment will be surrendered to GE in full and complete
satisfaction of GE&rsquo;s Class 10 Secured Claim. In such case
 Class 10 will be deemed to be an impaired Class and entitled to
vote on the Plan. GE&rsquo;s deficiency Claims
 if any
 shall be treated as Class 11 or Class 12 General Unsecured Claims
 at the
election of GE.

Bidder designates that it intends to treat the GE Agreements as disguised security agreements and that the Successful Bidder seeks
to retain the GE Equipment
 Successful Bidder shall commence
 within 30 days of the Effective Date
 an adversary proceeding before
the Court for such determination
 including a determination as to whether GE has a perfected security interest in the GE Equipment.
Upon final Court order with respect to the amount of GE&rsquo;s Class 10 Secured Claim
 such amount will be paid in full 30

    
    


after entry of final order setting forth the amount of GE&rsquo;s Secured Claim
 if any
 with respect to the GE Equipment. In such
case
 Class 10 will be deemed to be an impaired Class and entitled to vote on the Plan. GE&rsquo;s deficiency Claims
 if any
 shall
be treated as Class 11 or Class 12 General Unsecured Claims
 at the election of GE. In the event that a determination is made that
the GE Agreements are disguised security agreements and that GE does not have a perfected security interest in the GE Equipment
then GE will not hold a Class 10 Secured Claim and GE&rsquo;s Claims
 if any
 shall be treated as Class 11 or Class 12 General
Unsecured Claims
 at the election of GE.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 (Administrative Convenience Class) consists of General Unsecured Claims
 either:
(i) in the amount of $10
000 or less (except that the holders of such Claims may elect to have their Claims treated as Class 12
Claims); or (ii) the holders of which Claims elect to reduce their claims to $10
000. Viansa believes that such General Unsecured
Claims total approximately $600
 distribution of a lump sum of $150
000
 as soon
as practicable after the Effective Date. Laurus shall not share in any proceeds distributed to holders of Class 11 Claims. This
Class is impaired and entitled to vote on this Plan.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 consists of all General Unsecured Claims other than Class 11 Claims. Viansa
believes that such General Unsecured Claims total approximately $1.5 million
 not including any potential deficiency claim of Gryphon.
 distribution of a lump sum of $150
000
 to be paid as soon as practicable after the
Effective Date. In addition
 Class 12 shall receive the net proceeds (after deduction of all fees and costs related to pursuing
such actions) from the Assigned Litigation
 after all Allowed Professional Fees are paid in full. Laurus shall not share in any
proceeds distributed to holders of Class 12 Claims. This Class is impaired and entitled to vote on this Plan.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 consists of Global&rsquo;s Equity Security Interest in Viansa. Global&rsquo;s
existing 100% ownership of the Equity Security Interests in Reorganized Viansa shall be cancelled. Up to 100% of the new Equity
Security Interests in the Reorganized Viansa shall be issued to the Successful Bidder at the Confirmation Hearing. In light of
the fact that this Class does not receive a distribution under the Plan
 this Class is deemed to have rejected the Plan and
 therefore
not entitled to vote on this Plan.

valuable
 the most valuable asset of the Viansa Estate is the winery operation. This operation consists primarily of (a) the winery
located in Sonoma and retail operations related thereto; (b) the wine club with thousands of members located nationwide enjoying
monthly shipments of wines; and (c) special events (e.g.
 weddings
 corporate retreats
 birthdays) held at the events center at
the winery. Viansa does not sell its wines through retail stores
 but directly to the retail customers. As a result


    
    


on its wine club members for its operations. Since the wine club members pay on a monthly basis
 liquidation would result in cessation
of operations
 which would result in termination of memberships. Without members
 the wine club will have minimal
 if any value.
Similarly
 the value of Viansa&rsquo;s inventory can only be maximized through retail sales to wine club members and visitors to
the winery. In the event of a liquidation
 and without the ability to continue operating and servicing the wine club member and
the general public
 membership and visits to the winery will plummet. Since Viansa sells its wines directly to the customer
 it
does not have retail distribution channels or exposure to retailers. The wine will not be able to be sold at retail prices since

 Viansa&rsquo;s reputation will be damaged. Inventory will
 therefore
 have to be sold on a wholesale
basis
 resulting in a fraction of revenues as compared to retail sales.

 in the event of a liquidation
under Chapter 7
 Viansa believes that its assets would be insufficient to pay Croesus and Laurus
 and that all other creditors
would receive no distribution.

 no cash distributions shall be made on account of any Allowed Claim if the cash distribution amount is less

 will be automatically transferred
to the newly-created Chapter 7 estates. The automatic stay will be reimposed with respect to such assets
 but only to the extent
that relief from stay was not previously authorized by the Bankruptcy Court during the Case. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 all
transfers to the successful bidder shall be deemed final and irrevocable and not subject to reversion to the Estate in the event
of conversion to Chapter 7 or dismissal of the Case.

as contemplated by Bankruptcy Rule 3022
 then the Trust will file a motion with the Court to obtain a final decree to close the
Viansa Case. After the Effective Date
 the Trust will be responsible for timely payment of all fees incurred pursuant to 28 U.S.C.

In the event of an asset sale
 secured creditors are authorized to credit bid up to the amount of their secured claim pursuant
to 11 U.S.C. &sect; 363(k). While Section 363(k) is not applicable in the case of selling equity under a &ldquo;new value&rdquo;
plan
 Viansa submits that the net effect is identical. For example
 if a creditor holds a secured claim in the amount of $40 million
the secured creditor can credit bid such amount pursuant to Section 363(k)
 which would not result in a cash payment by the secured
creditor
 but only satisfaction of its secured claim. In the alternative
 the secured creditor may pay $40 million in connection
with a &ldquo;new value&rdquo; plan
 which proceeds would inure back to the secured creditor on account of its secured claim. The
net result is the same. Thus
 Viansa believes it would be appropriate for the secured creditors to be allowed to bid the amount
of their secured claims as &ldquo;new value
&rdquo; subject to payment or satisfaction of senior obligations. Viansa refers to
such bidding as a credit bid.


attorneys&rsquo; fees.

A settlement as to the treatment of the Gryphon Claims in the Viansa Case
 as well as the distribution of the Texas Property Sale
Proceeds in the Global Case
 has been executed by Debtors
 Gryphon
 Laurus
 and Croesus
 and is being separately presented for
approval by the Bankruptcy Court.

In addition to the Carve-Out
 the Carneros Escrow Balance will be available for payment of allowed professional fees of the Committee&rsquo;s
professionals. Moreover
 in the event that Laurus is the Successful Bidder
 then
 on the Effective Date
 Laurus will cause Reorganized
Viansa to fund the Carve Out in the amount of $1.5 million. In the event that Reorganized Viansa does not have sufficient funds
on hand on the Effective Date to fund the Carve Out
 Laurus will fund $1.5 million directly to LNBRB as the Disbursing Agent for
this purpose

In the event that Laurus is the Successful Bidder
 then
 on the Effective Date
 Laurus will cause Reorganized Viansa to fund $300
000
for the benefit of the general unsecured creditors. In the event that Reorganized Viansa does not have sufficient funds on hand
on the Effective Date to fund this amount
 Laurus will fund $300
000 directly to LNBRB as the Disbursing Agent for this purpose.

This amount includes approximately $323
000 in potential cure owed to GE. In the event that a determination is made that the leases
with GE are disguised security agreements and not leases
 this payment will not be required.

On the Effective Date
 the Committee will be deemed to have been terminated.

and nonfinancial attributes and allows Creditors and Interest Holders to participate in the Reorganized Debtor&rsquo;s future
operations.

Exhibits to this Plan are incorporated into and are a part of this Plan and Disclosure Statement as if set forth in full herein.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


Debtor was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 8
 2002. On August 1
 2003
 the Debtor completed a reverse acquisition
of Tech-Net Communications
 Inc.
 a Nevada corporation that was incorporated on May 15
 2000. Following the reverse acquisition
the Debtor changed the name of Tech-Net Communications
 Inc. to &ldquo;Knightsbridge Fine Wines
 Inc.&rdquo; Effective February
15
 2005
 the Debtor changed its name from Knightsbridge Fine Wines
 Inc. to &ldquo;360 Global Wine Company.&rdquo; Global is
a public company whose stock trades under the symbol &ldquo;TSIXQ&rdquo;.

Operating History prior to the Petition Date is described in the Omnibus Statement of Facts in Support of First Day Motions filed
on March 9
 2007
 a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit &ldquo;1.&rdquo; As discussed in more detail therein
 Global and
its operating subsidiary
 Viansa
 experienced a significant financial crisis derived
 in part
 from their dispute with Kirkland
Knightsbridge
 LLC (&ldquo;KKLLC&rdquo;)
 with whom Global entered into a joint venture in 2004. KKLLC filed for bankruptcy protection
in September of 2006
 at which time KKLLC was in possession of substantial inventory of Viansa. Without access to this inventory
Viansa was unable to ship the wines to its wine club members. As a result
 its revenues declined precipitously and Viansa was
unable to service its debt with Laurus. Shortly prior to the Petition Date
 Laurus sent a notice of default to Viansa and Global
and called its loan due. Viansa and Global commenced their bankruptcy cases in order to protect the value of their assets.
GLOBAL&rsquo;S
BANKRUPTCY CASE

March 7
 2007 (the &ldquo;Petition Date&rdquo;)
 Global and Viansa each filed a voluntary petition for relief with the Bankruptcy
Court under the Bankruptcy Code. On March 23
 2007
 this Court issued an Order granting joint administration of the two cases.

after the Petition Date
 KKLLC filed its motion to transfer venue of the cases to Northern District of California
 Santa Rosa
Division. The Debtors
 as well as numerous creditors
 opposed the motion
 which was eventually denied by this Court.

    
    



Committee was appointed in both of the cases on April 23
 2007.

June 27
 2007 the Bankruptcy Court entered the Laurus Cash Collateral Order and the DIP Order
 and on July 27
 2007 the Bankruptcy
Court entered the Gryphon Cash Collateral Order. Pursuant to these orders
 the Debtors continued to operate pursuant to terms
approved by Croesus
 Laurus
 Gryphon
 and the Bankruptcy Court until confirmation of Viansa&rsquo;s Plan of Reorganization.

Debtors sought and obtained Bankruptcy Court approval of a settlement with KKLLC
 which was approved by order entered on August
16
 2007. Pursuant to the settlement
 all litigation (including appeals) between the Debtors and KKLLC has been dismissed. In
addition
 Viansa obtained a turnover of its wine inventory (and related items) which was maintained in KKLLC&rsquo;s possession
to the exclusion of Viansa. KKLLC was allowed General Unsecured Claims in this Case totaling $10 million as part of the settlement.

Debtors engaged Gordian Financial Services to assist with marketing Viansa&rsquo;s business; and Global employed Capital City
Sotheby&rsquo;s International Realty to assist with the marketing of the Texas Property.

Committee engaged BBK
 Ltd. as its financial advisor in connection with the two bankruptcy cases.

Debtor retained The Hall Group as its auditor by Order entered June 6
 2007 and retained Sichenzia Ross Friedman Ference LLP as
its special SEC counsel by Order entered October 15
 2007.

Bankruptcy Court Order entered on March 25
 2008
 the Debtor sold the Texas Property to the City of Granite Shoals and the Christ
Redeemer Fellowship for the aggregate sale price of $3
200
000.

March 27
 2008
 the Bankruptcy Court entered its Order Granting the Motion of the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors for
Authority to Pursue Claims on Behalf of the Debtor&rsquo;s Estate
 whereby the Committee was authorized to pursue claims and causes
of action of the Debtor against its officers
 directors and shareholders.

30
 2008
 the Bankruptcy Court approved a settlement with certain Creditors whereby their Claims against the Debtor
 including
any possible Administrative Claims
 were resolved by the allowance of a total of $375
000 in General Unsecured Claims in favor
of those Creditors.


    
    


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


primary asset consisted of the Texas Property
 which was sold pursuant to Bankruptcy Court Order on March 25
 2008 for $3
200
000.00.
The proceeds of sale were primarily used to pay costs of sale
 Secured Claims including the Gryphon Secured Claim
 as well as
to fund the Carve Out. A detailed description of Global&rsquo;s assets as of the Petition Date is set forth in Global&rsquo;s
Amended Schedules filed on May 11
 2007.

asserted against Global are listed in Exhibit &ldquo;2&rdquo; attached hereto
 which exhibit lists all Claims scheduled by Global
in its bankruptcy schedules and all Claims filed with the Bankruptcy Court. Pursuant to Rule 3003(c)(2) of the Federal Rules of
Bankruptcy Procedure
 those Creditors whose Claims were scheduled as disputed
 contingent or unliquidated and who did not timely
file a proof of Claim shall not be treated as Creditors for purposes of voting or distribution under this Plan. All such Creditors
are listed on Exhibit &ldquo;2&rdquo; as having a Claim in a zero amount. All of Global&rsquo;s Secured Claims of Croesus
 Laurus
and Gryphon have been satisfied by the sale of the Texas Property or by the confirmation of Viansa&rsquo;s plan of reorganization.
As a result of the sale of the Texas Property for less than the liens against it
 Gryphon claims an unsecured deficiency Claim
of approximately $5.9 million. General Unsecured Claims aggregate approximately $20 million. There are filed priority Tax Claims
(which the Debtor disputes) totaling approximately $210
000. The total pre-petition Claims asserted are approximately as follows:


    
    

    

000
000.00

    

000.00

    

210.000.00

    
    



addition
 Global has incurred amounts due to professionals hired in the Case as set forth in Section VII.B.1. herein.

    
    


SUMMARY
OF PLAN AND TREATMENT OF CLAIMS

is a reorganization Plan. The Reorganized Debtor will continue with its operations after Confirmation as a publicly-held company
engaged in the business of strategic business acquisitions. The Carve-Out will be used to pay the CEO/CRO Administrative Claim
and Allowed Professional Fees on a pro rata basis
 with the balance of these Claims to be paid from the recovery of the Assigned
Litigation
 which will be pursuant by the Global Trust. In addition
 these Claimants will share in a pro rata distribution of
3
750
000 shares of the New Common Stock. Priority Tax Claims (if any) will either be paid in Cash on Confirmation or will receive
deferred cash payments over a five (5) year period from the Petition Date. Class 4 General Unsecured Creditors will receive for
pro rata distribution 1
000
000 shares of New Common Stock and the Class 5 General Unsecured Creditor will receive 50
000 shares
of New Common Stock. Class 6 equity security holders will receive 100
000 shares of New Common Stock for pro rata distribution.

VII.
CLASSIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF CLAIMS AND INTERESTS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


required by the Bankruptcy Code
 this Plan classifies Claims and interests in various Classes according to their right to priority.
This Plan states whether each Class is either impaired or unimpaired
 and proposes the treatment that each Class will receive.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


types of Claims are not placed into voting Classes; instead they remain unclassified. These Claims are not considered impaired
and are therefore not entitled to vote on this Plan because they are automatically entitled to specific treatment provided for
them in the Bankruptcy Code. As such
 Global has 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


Claims are claims for costs or expenses of administering the Case that are allowed under Bankruptcy Code &sect; 507(a)(2). The
Bankruptcy Code requires that all Administrative Claims be paid on the Effective Date unless a particular holder of an Administrative
Claim agrees to a different treatment. Unpaid Administrative Claims include the CEO/CRO Administrative Claim
 estimated to be
approximately $550
000 at Confirmation.

Trustee fees
 to the extent not previously paid
 will be paid in full on the Effective Date
 or at such later date as such fees
may become due and payable. Global estimates that the total Allowed Professional Fees will be in the range of $850
000 to $910
000.

    
    



Allowed Professional Fees and the CEO/CRO Administrative Claim will receive an initial distribution on a pro rata basis from the
Carve-Out on the later of the (a) Effective Date; and (b) date of entry of the order allowing the professional fees and costs.

addition to a pro rata distribution of the Carve-Out
 a pro rata distribution of 3
750
000 shares of New Common Stock will be
made to professionals and the CEO/CRO based upon the total amount of the CEO/CRO Administrative Claim and the Allowed Professional
Fees. The unpaid balance of such fees after distribution of the Carve-Out shall be paid on a pro rata basis from the proceeds
of the Assigned Litigation.
Requirement
of Court Approval of Fees
Administrative Claims. For all fees except Clerk&rsquo;s Office fees and U.S. Trustee fees
 the professional in question must
file and serve a properly noticed fee application
 and the Court must rule on the application. Only Allowed Professional Fees
will be eligible to be paid under this Plan.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


Bankruptcy Code requires that each holder of a Priority Tax Claim receive the present value of such Claim in deferred Cash payments.
Except as otherwise allowed by the Bankruptcy Court
 holders of Priority Tax Claims shall not be entitled to receive any penalties
with respect to or arising in connection with such Claims and such penalties shall be treated as General Unsecured Claims.

believes that the Priority Tax Claims will not exceed the sum of $5
000.00. Priority Tax Claims filed by the IRS and the California
Franchise Tax Board were filed as estimated Claims since the Debtor had not filed its Federal or State tax returns by the Petition
Date. The Debtor has filed its Federal and State income tax returns
 which show no income taxes owing to either the IRS or the
Franchise Tax Board.

the option of Reorganized Global
 Allowed Priority Tax Claims shall be paid either (1) in cash on the Effective Date; or (2) deferred
cash payments
 in equal quarterly installments
 over the period ending five (5) years from the Petition Date
 with interest to
accrue at the federal interest rate as set forth in 26 U.S.C. &sect; 6621(a)(2)
 which is 5% per annum as of September 30
 2008
(or such other interest rate as agreed to by Global and the holder of such Allowed Priority Tax Claim
 or such rate as determined
by the Bankruptcy Court to be appropriate
 if such a determination is requested by the holder of such Allowed Priority Tax Claim
no later than the date upon which objections to Confirmation of this Plan are due). At the option of Reorganized Global
 such
deferred payments may be prepaid
 in whole or in part.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 consists of the Allowed Claims of holders of statutory liens
 other than Priority
Tax Claims
 but including Secured Claims for real or personal property taxes. Global believes that there are no such Claims since
all of its tangible assets have been liquidated. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 consists of the Laurus Secured Claim. Upon the closing of the Texas Real Property
sale
 Laurus&rsquo; Secured Claim was paid in full from the proceeds of the sale in accordance with the Settlement Agreement. Class
2 is therefore not impaired under this Plan.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 consists of the Gryphon Secured Claim. Upon the closing of the Texas Real Property
sale
 the Gryphon Secured Claim was paid in full from the proceeds of sale in accordance with the Settlement Agreement. Class 3
is therefore not impaired under this Plan.
&#9;Class
4
 except for the Class 5 Claim of KKLLC. Global estimates that such General Unsecured
Claims total approximately $15 million. Class 4 shall receive for pro rata distribution 1
000
000 shares of New Common Stock.
In addition
 Class 4 shall receive for pro rata distribution any net recovery obtained from the Assigned Litigation after payment
of unpaid Administrative Claims and unpaid Priority Tax Claims. Class 4 is impaired under this Plan.
Class
5
000 shares of New Common Stock
in full satisfaction of the Class 5 Claim. Class 5 is impaired under this Plan.
&#9;Class
6 
receive for pro rata distribution 100
000 shares of New Common Stock. The record date for stock ownership for such distribution
shall be December 1
 2008. Class 6 is impaired under this Plan.

Plan
 and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder.


    
    


IX.&#9;BUSINESS
PLAN FOR REORGANIZED GLOBAL

is made up of two activities:

undertaking the administrative
 accounting
 SEC related
 and all other work necessary to prepare and file updated financial statements
and annual and quarterly reports with the SEC and any other governmental organizations
 in order to re-establish Reorganized Global
as a fully reporting public company and re-list its common stock on a nationally recognized stock exchange or market quotation
system. In order to accomplish this goal
 Reorganized Global&rsquo;s plan is to complete the following SEC filings (among other
filings and reports)
 which Reorganized Global will utilize best efforts to complete within 12 months from the Effective Date
of the Plan:


31




the year ended December 31

second activity is to conduct the search
 perform the necessary analysis
 negotiate a price and structure
 plan the financing
and raise the necessary capital to acquire an operating business or effect a merger or acquisition
 or capital stock exchange
asset acquisition
 or other similar business combination with an operating business. The business going forward shall not be inconsistent
with the business prior to filing for Chapter 11. However
 Reorganized Global will not be limited to a particular industry. Nevertheless
management of Global has initially focused on the wine
 communications
 Global Positioning Systems
 and related industries. To
date
 their efforts have been limited to exploring financing and acquisition opportunities with the intent to maximize the value
of the business for Global&rsquo;s Creditors. Global&rsquo;s efforts in identifying a prospective target business have been ongoing
since January 2008. Global has examined over 100 business opportunities including a wide range of detailed discussions with financing
and management partners. Examples of acquisitions currently under examination are:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Acquisition of $20
000
000 of assets from a Chapter 7 liquidation case generating $6
000
000 of income.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Acquisition of a $150
000
000 wine business in partnership with a major wine group that would benefit from Global&rsquo;s operating
losses

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Acquisition of 50% of a technology based company specializing in music and film


    
    


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Reverse merger opportunities: i.e.
 establishment of an investment fund in which Reorganized Global would be the general partner
and limited partners would fund acquisitions; Reorganized Global would receive 85% of the income of the partnership and the limited
partners would receive 85% of the capital gains
 thus maximizing the assets of Reorganized Global for Creditors


has received an informal offer to purchase the Global shell for $20
000. However
 Debtor&rsquo;s management believes that the
potential value to be received by Creditors from Reorganized Global&rsquo;s stock under this Plan is considerably higher. The
following is a chart of the types of transactions and potential value Creditors might recover under optimal circumstances:

X.&#9;LIQUIDATION
ANALYSIS

Plan must provide that a nonconsenting impaired Claimant or interest holder of a consenting Class receive at least as much as
would be available had the Debtor filed a Chapter 7 petition instead.

a Chapter 7 case
 the general rule is that the Debtor's assets are sold by a trustee. Unsecured creditors share in the proceeds
of sale only after secured Creditors and administrative Claimants are paid.

Creditor would recover from the assets of the bankruptcy Estate less under Chapter 7 than under Chapter 11 for at least two reasons.
First
 the recovery by Creditors in a liquidation would be less than the recovery proposed under the Plan because the Plan proposes
to distribute 4
800
000 shares of the New Common Stock to Creditors. In a Chapter 7
 there would be no stock to distribute since
the Debtor would be liquidated and its stock would be worthless. Second
 in a Chapter 7 case
 a trustee is appointed and is entitled
to compensation from the bankruptcy estate pursuant to Section 326(a) of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. &sect; 326(a)) in an amount
no more than 25% of the first $5
000 of all moneys disbursed
 10% on any amount over $5
000 but no more than $50
000
 5% on any
amount over $50
000 but no more than $1
000
000
 and such reasonable compensation no more than 3% of moneys over $1
000
000. Pursuant
to the terms of the Plan
 the Global Trustee will receive a flat fee of three percent (3%) of any recovery. This fee will be less
than a Chapter 7 trustee&rsquo;s fee calculated pursuant to Section 326(a).

    
    



XI.&#9;MANNER
OF DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Authority to Object to
 and to Compromise
 Claims.

Global Trust
 or any other party in interest
 will have the right to file objections to the allowance of any Claims filed on or
prior to the Claims Objection Bar Date. The Global Trust&rsquo;s right to object to the allowance of any Claims shall include
the right to assert counterclaims and setoff rights. The Global Trust will have the authority
 in the reasonable exercise of its
business judgment
 to settle or compromise any Claim following the Effective Date by submitting an appropriate stipulation to
the Court with notice to the Post-Effective Date Notice Parties. So long as no objection and request for hearing on such stipulation
is filed within ten (10) calendar days of such notice
 the Global Trust shall be entitled to effectuate the settlement of the
Claim.
Disallowance of Certain Scheduled
Claims

to Rule 3003(c)(2) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure
 those Creditors whose Claims were scheduled as disputed
 contingent
or unliquidated and who did not timely file a proof of Claim shall not be treated as Creditors for purposes of voting or distribution
under this Plan. All such Creditors are listed on Exhibit &ldquo;2&rdquo; as having a Claim that is disputed and in a zero (0.00)
amount. The Order confirming this Plan shall include a provision that all such Claims are disallowed and shall not receive a distribution
under the Plan.


provided by Section 502(c) of the Bankruptcy Code
 the Bankruptcy Court may estimate any contingent
 unliquidated
 or disputed
Claim for the limited purpose of determining the Claimant&rsquo;s eligibility to participate in the Confirmation of this Plan.
Such estimation will be of a temporary and limited nature
 and will not in any way affect the ultimate disallowance or allowance
of the Claim
 or the ability of any party in interest to subsequently object to the allowance of such Claim.



Court will retain jurisdiction over the Case to resolve any objections to Claims which are filed after the Effective Date or which
are filed prior to the Effective Date but which are not resolved to final order prior to the Effective Date. The Confirmation
Order shall not be res judicata
 collateral estoppel
 or other bar to Reorganized Global&rsquo;s
 the Global Trust&rsquo;s or

XV.&#9;MISCELLANEOUS
ISSUES REGARDING PLAN DISTRIBUTIONS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


Distribution to be distributed to any Claimant under this Plan shall be forfeited to Reorganized Global unless claimed by the
Claimant before the later of: (i) one (1) year after the Confirmation Date; or (ii) sixty (60) days after an order allowing that
Claimant&rsquo;s Claim becomes a final order.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


anything to the contrary in this Plan
 no Cash Distributions shall be made on account of any Allowed Claim if the Cash Distribution
amount is less than $25.00. Holders of Allowed Claims who would otherwise be entitled to a Distribution in an amount of less than
$25.00 shall receive no Distribution on account of such Allowed Claim because the value of such Allowed Claim would be de minimus
and the administrative costs associated with processing and mailing the Distribution to the holder of such Allowed Claim would
likely exceed the amount of the Distribution. No Distribution of less than 100 shares of New Common Stock shall be made to any
holder of an Allowed Claim or a Class 6 interest
 as such a Distribution would be de minimus.




    
    




fractional shares of New Common Stock shall be issued and all fractional shares shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share.
Holders of Allowed Claims who would be entitled to fractional shares but for this provision shall receive no consideration therefore
because such amount will be de minimus.


resolution of all outstanding objections to disputed Claims
 and the payment of all expenses and other obligations
 the Global
Trust shall cause the distribution of all remaining available assets of the Global Trust: (i) first
 to each holder of an Allowed
Administrative Claim
 (ii) second
 to each holder of an Allowed Tax Priority Claim; and (iii) third
 to each holder of an Allowed
Claim in Class 4 pro rata in the proration that each holder&rsquo;s Allowed Class 4 Claim bears to the aggregate amount of all
Class 4 Allowed Claims.
