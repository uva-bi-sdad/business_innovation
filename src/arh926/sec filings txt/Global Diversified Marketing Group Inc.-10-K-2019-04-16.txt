Global
Diversified Marketing Group
 Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) is a food and snack manufacturer
 marketer and distributor through
its subsidiary Global Diversified Holdings
 Inc (&ldquo;GDHI&rdquo;) in the United States
 Canada
 and Europe. The Company operates
through snacks segments offering Italian Wafers
 French Madeleines
 Wafer Pralines
 Mini Honey Wafers
 Puffs Bites
 Coconut Rolls
and other wholesome snacks.

The
Company (through its subsidiary GDHI) is a successfully operating snack and gourmet food company. The Company travels the world
and attends global food trade shows to look for unique products and snacks. When it locates exciting and suitable products
 the
Company will enter into a non-exclusive manufacturing contract with a factory to produce the product under the Company&rsquo;s
own trademarked brands for sale in the United States and global markets.

The
products are chosen based on the trend of consumer interests as garnered by the Company as well as certain requests from the buyers
as to what they are looking for to add to their product offerings. If the product sales are not within the projected targets
then the Company will discontinue that product. To date
 the Company has not discontinued a product for failure to meet its projected
targets.

Although
the Company does not have long-term contracts with any of retail chains
 it has been supplying its current chain retail stores
for several years. In the food industry
 there are no on-going contracts. A buyer will place a Purchase Order with the Company
and the Company will deliver on it. If the product does well
 the buyer typically will continue to reorder the product. Typical
payment schedule for the Company&rsquo;s products are net 30 day terms.

Vending
Operations

In
addition to placing its products with large retail chains
 the Company places its products in vending machines throughout the
United States. These vending machines are located in malls
 service stations and schools. The Company works with vending companies
that have
 in the aggregate
 more than 100
000 machines nationwide. The Company supplies vending companies with product. The Company
works directly with some vending companies and with others through its food service distributors. The broker pre-sells the products
and the distributor services the accounts. When the distributor services the accounts
 the distributor buys product directly from
the Company and pays on a net 10 day term.

Products
and Trademarked Brands

The
Company currently has five trademark brands. Each brand encompasses numerous SKUs which are brought to market from time to time.
The Company produces its products primarily on an &ldquo;on request&rdquo; basis from its retail chain buyers for sale through
such chains.

The
Company&rsquo;s trademark brands are listed on the left below with sample products for several of the trademarked brands itemized:

Retail
Chain Buyers

The
primary distribution of the Company&rsquo;s products are through several major retail chains. The Company works with the buyers
who place orders for the Company&rsquo;s products. The retail chain represented by these buyers will then distribute the product
to its retail outlets.



The
Company&rsquo;s products appeal to a wide range of consumers
 including most all age brackets. The young snackers
 classified
as those being between the ages of 18-34
 tend to consume more snacks then average adult but the gourmet foods reach the broader
adult market. The senior market tends to reduce snacks and gourmet foods.

The
Company sells its products throughout the United States and global markets to buyers which typically represent recognized large
retail chain stores. The products are then distributed by the chains to their local outlets. The Company locates and develops
snacks and gourmet foods to brand under its trademarks based on feedback and demand. The Company works closely with buyers to
determine what products to locate and produce and to supply to the buyers.

The
Company intends to continue to develop additional gourmet foods and snack products under its own trademarked brands expanding
the Company&rsquo;s offering portfolio. Management believes that the acquisition of small brands that have regional success and
adding these to the Company&rsquo;s national distribution can immediately generate additional revenue streams for the Company.

Product
Activations 

The
Company will set up blind taste test at neutral locations
 in stores
 malls and snack shops to let consumers sample products and
to determine consumer preferences
 and most importantly
 find out the basis for those preferences. Is it the taste
 the packaging
or Company image? This will also serve as an opportunity for the Company to highlight its products directly to the consumer.

The
Company anticipates that it will primarily target teens and adults up to age 65. The primary target market is &ldquo;Young Snackers&rdquo;
that are 18-34 years old and tend to eat more snacks than other age groups. The trend of snacks between meals is especially strong
with millennial and younger Americans. A quarter of American millennials
 age 23 to 40
 report eating four or more times a day
compared to just 10% of Gen X and 9% of Baby Boomers. The Company believes that the senior age bracket (over 65) is not a strong
snack market.



The
snack food industry in the United States is very competitive
 particularly in the savory and salty snack segment. Snacks are satisfying
consumer cravings around the world with the snacking business growing to US$3.4 billion globally in 2017. In the United States
a study conducted by the Packaging Strategies reported that snacks account for 51% of all food sales
 and 92% of adults in the
US have snacked within the last 24 hours.

The
snack industry has experienced an increase demand for &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; snacks. In the United States
 companies are finding
success in the &ldquo;snackable&rdquo; fruit and vegetable category
 such as grapes or baby carrots. These portable-produce items
are then repackaged into individual serving such as dried fruit and nut snack packs
 small fresh smoothies and fruit cups. Consumers
has shown a very positive response to this snacking sub-category making it a billion dollar industry with an compounded annual
growth rate of 10% between 2012 and 2016.

A
challenge facing entrants is snack and gourmet food market is the dominance of leading snack food producers
 particularly the
industry leader PepsiCo. Large producers experience a high degree of brand and consumer loyalty and possess sufficient capital
to invest in extensive advertising and promotions to obtain a greater market share. Furthermore
 companies such as PepsiCo benefit
from higher profit margins when compared with small- to medium-sized operators
 enabling them to lower their product prices and
to engage in price-based competition with competitors. Multinational producers also experience lower per-unit costs due to economies
of scale and scope.


    
    


Trading
Market

Currently
there is no trading market for the securities of the Company. The Company intends to initially apply for admission to quotation
of its securities on the OTC QB or QX as soon as possible which may be while this offering is still in process. There can be no
assurance that the Company will qualify for quotation of its securities on the OTCQB or QX.

Management&rsquo;s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations


Prior
to the acquisition of GDHI as a subsidiary
 the Company had no operations other than the administrative operations involved with
the change in control. The information discussed hereinbelow reflects the results of the Company&rsquo;s subsidiary
 GDHI
 a successfully
operating company in the snack and gourmet food production
 marketing and distribution industry.

Discussion
of the Year Ended 2017 and Year Ended 2018

Revenues
and Losses

Sales
for the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017 were relatively consistent with sales in 2018 of $1
161
995 and sales in 2017 of
$1
298
372. For the year ended December 31
 2018 gross profit was $378
273 with expenses of $431
192 resulting in
a loss of $52
919) compared to gross profit of $311
944 with expenses of $292
863 resulting in net income of $19
081 for the
year ended December 31
 2017. The increase in expenses included to a large part legal and other professional fees required to
effect the Company&rsquo;s initial public offering.


    
    


Total
current liabilities for the year ended December 31
 2018 were $434
111 including $$357
909 in accounts payable and accrued expenses
compared to total current liabilities for year ended December 31
 2017 were $358
182 including $237
596 accounts payable and accrued
expenses. Loans payable remained relatively consistent of $76
202 for the year ended December 31
 2018 and$75
586 for the year
ended December 31
 2017.

The
Company has four customers that represent 100% of its business in 2018 ranging which is up from such customers representing 95%
of the company&rsquo;s business in 2017. The largest of these customers represents 31% and the smallest 20%. However
 the loss
of any one of these customers would have a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s business and revenues until such time as the
Company was able to locate other buyers. Presently the Company spends a minimum amount on advertising consisting of $3
424 and
$2
015 for the years ended December
 31
 2018 and December 31
 2017
 respectively.

During
the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 the Company incurred consulting fees of $180
000 and $127
500 respectively
 related
to services provided to it by the president of the Company.

The
Company has two short term credit line debts which have remained relatively consistent in the years ending December 31
 2018 and
December 31
 2017:

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

GDHI
has not incurred any significant debt during the development of its operations and as of December 31
 2018 and December 31
 2017.
The Company had lease payments for its office space of $17
600 in 2017
 $19
334 in 2018 and has continuing annual lease
obligations of $19
923 in 2019
 $20
517 in 2020 and $21
132 in 2021.

Results
of Operations

The
Company has not experienced any unusual or infrequent events or transactions or any significant economic changes that have materially
affected the amount of reported income from continuing operations The Company does not believe that its operations and revenues
have been impacted by any economic inflation. The Company anticipates that its sales may increase as it develops it health food
brands targeted to the more economic and health-aware consumer.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements.

The
Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial
condition
 changes in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures or capital
resources.

Critical
Accounting Policies

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. The preparation of these financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts
of assets
 liabilities
 revenues and expenses
 and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates are
based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances
 the
results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Going
Concern

The
Company&rsquo;s independent auditor has indicated substantial doubt about the Company continuing as a going concern based on
the Company&rsquo;s accumulated deficit and accrued liabilities.

The
Company attributes the losses in 2018 to the legal fees incurred in order to go public. &nbsp;The Company is in a period of expansion
which causes some cash flow changes. The Company has a strong relationship with its suppliers and has good credit terms with them.
In order to meet such expansion demands the Company has a revolving credit facility in place.

The
Company has projected that its expansion and placements will be above expectations in 2019 and will create a strong year
in revenue and net profits. The Company has had discussions with its clients what needs to be done to increase orders in
December 2019.

The
Company is undertaking a public offering of its 2
500
000 shares of its common stock at $2 per share to raise funds for expansion
and distribution.

Changes
    in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure


There
were no disagreements with the Company&rsquo;s accountants on accounting or financial disclosure for the period covered by this
report.




    
    


Pursuant
to Rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission
 the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules. This evaluation was done

executive officer (who is also the principal financial officer). There have been no significant changes in internal controls
or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date of the evaluation. Based upon
that evaluation
 the principal officer believes that the Company&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
gathering
 analyzing and disclosing information needed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company
in its periodic reports is recorded
 summarized and processed timely. The principal executive officer is directly involved in
the day-to-day operations of the Company

Management&rsquo;s
Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The
Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
the Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company&rsquo;s sole officer
 its president
 conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2018
 based on the criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(2013). Based on this evaluation
 management concluded that the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31
 2018
 based on those criteria. A control system can provide only reasonably
 not absolute
 assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues have been detected.


    
    


BF
Borgers CPA PC.
 Lakewood
 Colorado
 the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company
 has not issued an attestation
report on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting as no such report is required for
a smaller reporting company.

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In
the fourth fiscal quarter of the year
 the Company changed control and consequently the Company&rsquo;s internal controls over
its financial reporting were transferred to new management. However
 such control rested with the principal officer prior to the
change of control and with the change of control it continues to rest with the principal officer
 the Company&rsquo;s sole officer.
Thus such change has not materially affected
 or is not reasonably likely to materially affect
 the Company&rsquo;s internal control
over financial reporting.

Board of Directors has determined that it does not have any independent directors as that term is defined by NASDAQ Marketplace
Rule 5605(a)(2). In assessing the independence of the directors
 the Board considers any transactions
 relationships and arrangements
between our Company and our independent directors or their affiliated companies. This review is based primarily on responses of
the directors to questions in a director and officer questionnaire regarding employment
 business
 familial
 compensation and
other relationships with our Company or our management.


    
    


Director
Compensation

Directors
do not receive any compensation for serving on the Board of Directors.

Committees
and Terms

The
Board of Directors has not established any committees.

Conflicts
of Interest

There
are no binding guidelines or procedures for resolving potential conflicts of interest. Failure by management to resolve conflicts
of interest in favor of the Company could result in liability of management to the Company. However
 any attempt by shareholders
to enforce a liability of management to the Company would most likely be prohibitively expensive and time consuming.

Code
of Ethics

The
Company has not at this time adopted a Code of Ethics pursuant to rules described in Regulation S-K. The Company anticipates that
it will adopt a code of ethics when either the number of directors or the number of employees increases. The adoption of an Ethical
Code at this time would not serve the primary purpose of such a code to provide a manner of conduct as the development
 execution
and enforcement of such a code would be by the same persons and only persons to whom such code applied.

Corporate
Governance 

For
reasons similar to those described above
 the Company does not have a nominating nor audit committee of the board of directors.
At this time
 the Company has only one officer and one director. The Company promotes accountability for adherence to honest and
ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full
 fair
 accurate
 timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that
the Company files and will file with the SEC and in other public communications made by the Company; and strives to be compliant
with applicable governmental laws
 rules and regulations. The Company has not formally adopted a written code of business conduct
and ethics that governs the Company&rsquo;s employees
 officers and Directors as the Company is not required to do so.

In
lieu of an Audit Committee
 the Company&rsquo;s director is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning the
selection of outside auditors
 reviewing the scope
 results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company&rsquo;s financial
statements and other services provided by the Company&rsquo;s independent public accountants. The Company&rsquo;s director reviews
the Company&rsquo;s internal accounting controls
 practices and policies.

 Inc. (&ldquo;GDHI&rdquo;)

Company&rsquo;s operating subsidiary
 GDHI

Fees

The

The
Company does not currently have an audit committee serving and as a result its board of directors performs the duties of an audit
committee. The board of directors will evaluate and approve in advance
 the scope and cost of the engagement of an auditor before
the auditor renders audit and non-audit services. The Company does not rely on pre-approval policies and procedures.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
the shareholders and the board of directors of Global Diversified Marketing Group
 Inc.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Global Diversified Marketing Group
 Inc. as of December 31
 2018
and 2017
 the related statements of operations
 stockholders&rsquo; equity (deficit)
 and cash flows for the years then ended
and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;financial statements&rdquo;). In our opinion
 the financial statements
present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States.

Basis
for Opinion

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company&rsquo;s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error
or fraud.

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to
error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Substantial
Doubt about the Company&rsquo;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 1 to the financial statements
 the Company&rsquo;s significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty.

NOTES
TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER

 2018

NOTE
1 &ndash; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature
of Business

Global
Diversified Marketing Group
 Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;)
 formerly known as Dense Forest Acquisition Corporation
 was incorporated
in Delaware on December 1
 2017 and changed its name on June 13
 2018 as part of a change in control. As part of the change in
control
 its then officers and directors resigned and contributed back to the Company 19
500
000 shares of the 20
000
000 outstanding
shares of its common stock
 and appointed new officers and directors. On June 14
 2018 new management of the Company issued 12.500
000
shares of its common stock to Paul Adler
 the then president of the Company.

On
November 26
 2018 the Company effected the acquisition of Global Diversified Holdings
 Inc. (&ldquo;GDHI&rdquo;)
 a private New
York company owned by the Company&rsquo;s president
 with the issuance of 200 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock in exchange
for all of the outstanding shares of GDHI. GDHI became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company
 and its activity for the years
2018 and 2017 are reflected in these financial statements along with the expenses of the Company.

Prior
to the acquisition of GDHI
 the Company had no business and no operations. Pursuant to the acquisition
 the Company acquired the
operations and business plan of GDHI
 which imports and sells snack food products. For accounting purposes
 GDHI is considered
to be the acquirer
 and the equity is presented as if the business combination had occurred on January 1
 2017

Basis
of Presentation

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America and are presented in US dollars. The Company has adopted a December 31 year end.

Principles
of Consolidation

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The
Company&rsquo;s financial instruments consist of cash
 accounts receivable from customers
 accounts payable
 and loans payable.
The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates
that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of
the balance sheet. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Stock-Based
Compensation

As
of December 31
 2018
 the Company has not issued any share-based payments to its employees. Under the modified prospective method
the Company uses
 stock compensation expense includes compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted
 based
on the grant-date estimated fair value.

NOTES
TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER
31
 2018

NOTE
1 &ndash; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At
December 31
 2018 and 2017
 the Company had $21
515 and $0 of cash.

Accounts
Receivable

Accounts
receivable are generated from sales of snack food products to retail outlets throughout the United States. The Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based on customer payment and current credit worthiness
as determined by review of their current credit information. The Company continuously monitors credit limits for its customers
and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based on its historical experience and any specific customer issues that
have been identified. An allowance for doubtful; accounts is provided against accounts receivable for amounts management believes
may be uncollectible. The Company historically has not had issues collecting on its accounts receivable from its customers. The
Company factors certain of its receivables to improve its cash flow.

Bad
debt expense for the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017 was $0; the allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31
 2018 and
2017 was $0.



Inventory
consists of snack food products and packaging supplies
 and are stated at the lower of cost or market.

Property
and Equipment

Property
and equipment are stated at cost
 net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful life of the assets. Maintenance
 repairs
 and renewals that do not materially add to the value of the equipment
nor appreciably prolong its useful life are charged to expense as incurred.

Revenue
Recognition

Beginning
January 1
 2018
 the Company implemented ASC 606
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Although the new revenue standard is
expected to have an immaterial impact
 if any
 on our ongoing net income
 we did implement changes to our processes related to
revenue recognition and the control activities within them. These included the development of new policies based on the five-step
model provided in the new revenue standard
 ongoing contract review requirements
 and gathering of information provided for disclosures.

The
Company recognizes revenue from product sales or services rendered when control of the promised goods are transferred to our clients
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. To achieve
this core principle we apply the following five steps: identify the contract with the client
 identify the performance obligations
in the contract
 determine the transaction price
 allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract and
recognize revenues when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation.

Advertising
and Marketing Costs

The
Company&rsquo;s policy regarding advertising and marketing is to record the expense when incurred. The Company incurred advertising
and marketing expenses of $3
424 and $2
015 during the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.

NOTES
TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER
31
 2018

NOTE
1 &ndash; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets

The
Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may
not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present
 the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived
assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows.
If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets
 the Company recognizes an impairment loss
based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower
of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.

Income
Taxes

Income
taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method
 deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and
are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax
assets that
 based on available evidence
 are not expected to be realized.

The
Company&rsquo;s wholly owned subsidiary
 with the consent of its stockholder
 had elected to be taxed as an S Corporation under
the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Instead of paying federal corporate income taxes
 the stockholder(s) of an S Corporation
are taxed individually on their proportionate share of the Company&rsquo;s taxable income. Therefore
 prior to the business combination
discussed above
 the Company had made no provision for income taxes. Effective with the business combination
 the wholly owned
subsidiary became a C-corporation
 and the loss incurred for the period as a C-corporation approximated $270
000. See Note 7.

The
Company&rsquo;s income tax returns are open for examination for up to the past three years under the statute of limitations. There
are no tax returns currently under examination.

Comprehensive
Income

The
Company has which established standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income
 its components and accumulated balances.
When applicable
 the Company would disclose this information on its Statement of Stockholders&rsquo; Equity. Comprehensive income
comprises equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The Company has not had any significant
transactions that are required to be reported in other comprehensive income.

Basic
Income (Loss) Per Share

the period.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

The
Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company&rsquo;s
results of operations
 financial position or cash flow.

Going
Concern

As
of December 31
 2018
 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $21
515 and an accumulated deficit of $23
734.&nbsp; Additionally
the Company had accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $357
909. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the
Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financials have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern and
 accordingly
 do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty. If the Company is in fact unable to continue as a going concern
 the shareholders may lose some or all of their
investment in the Company.

&#13;Inc. (the &amp;#8220;Company&amp;#8221;)
 formerly known as Dense Forest Acquisition Corporation
 was incorporated in Delaware on December&#13;1
 2017 and changed its name on June 13
 2018 as part of a change in control. As part of the change in control
 its then officers&#13;and directors resigned and contributed back to the Company 19

 2018 the Company effected&#13;the acquisition of Global Diversified Holdings
 Inc. (&amp;#8220;GDHI&amp;#8221;)
 a private New York company owned by the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;president
 with the issuance of 200 shares of the Company&amp;#8217;s common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of&#13;GDHI. GDHI became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company

 the&#13;Company had no business and no operations. Pursuant to the acquisition
 the Company acquired the operations and business plan of&#13;GDHI
 which imports and sells snack food products. For accounting purposes
 GDHI is considered to be the acquirer

 the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the&#13;carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash&#13;flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets

 deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based&#13;on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently&#13;enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that
 based on available evidence

&#13;with the consent of its stockholder
 had elected to be taxed as an S Corporation under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.&#13;Instead of paying federal corporate income taxes
 the stockholder(s) of an S Corporation are taxed individually on their proportionate&#13;share of the Company&amp;#8217;s taxable income. Therefore
 prior to the business combination discussed above
 the Company had made&#13;no provision for income taxes. Effective with the business combination
 the wholly owned subsidiary became a C-corporation
 and&#13;the loss incurred for the period as a C-corporation approximated $270

 its components and accumulated balances. When applicable


 2018
 the Company&#13;had cash and cash equivalents of $21
515 and an accumulated deficit of $23
734.&amp;#160; Additionally
 the Company had accounts payable&#13;and accrued liabilities of $357

 the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the&#13;carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash&#13;flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets


 its components and accumulated balances. When applicable


 deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based&#13;on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently&#13;enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that
 based on available evidence

&#13;with the consent of its stockholder
 had elected to be taxed as an S Corporation under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.&#13;Instead of paying federal corporate income taxes
 the stockholder(s) of an S Corporation are taxed individually on their proportionate&#13;share of the Company&amp;#8217;s taxable income. Therefore
 prior to the business combination discussed above
 the Company had made&#13;no provision for income taxes. Effective with the business combination
 the wholly owned subsidiary became a C-corporation
 and&#13;the loss incurred for the period as a C-corporation approximated $270

NOTE 1 &#8211; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES




Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;)
 formerly known as Dense Forest Acquisition Corporation
 was incorporated in Delaware on December
1
 2017 and changed its name on June 13
 2018 as part of a change in control. As part of the change in control
 its then officers
and directors resigned and contributed back to the Company 19
500
000 shares of the 20
000
000 outstanding shares of its common
stock
 and appointed new officers and directors. On June 14
 2018 new management of the Company issued 12.500
000 shares of its
common stock to Paul Adler
 the then president of the Company.


 2018 the Company effected
the acquisition of Global Diversified Holdings
 Inc. (&#8220;GDHI&#8221;)
 a private New York company owned by the Company&#8217;s
president
 with the issuance of 200 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of
GDHI. GDHI became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company
 and its activity for the years 2018 and 2017 are reflected in these
financial statements along with the expenses of the Company.


 the
Company had no business and no operations. Pursuant to the acquisition
 the Company acquired the operations and business plan of
GDHI
 which imports and sells snack food products. For accounting purposes
 GDHI is considered to be the acquirer
 and the equity
is presented as if the business combination had occurred on January 1
 2017




have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented
in US dollars. The Company has adopted a December 31 year end.




statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.




consist of cash
 accounts receivable from customers
 accounts payable
 and loans payable. The carrying amounts of these financial
instruments approximates fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates
unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements.




in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheet. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.




 2018
 the Company
has not issued any share-based payments to its employees. Under the modified prospective method the Company uses
 stock compensation
expense includes compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted
 based on the grant-date estimated fair value.




investments with the original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At December 31
 2018 and 2017
 the Company
had $21

sales of snack food products to retail outlets throughout the United States. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of
its customers and adjusts credit limits based on customer payment and current credit worthiness
 as determined by review of their
current credit information. The Company continuously monitors credit limits for its customers and maintains a provision for estimated
credit losses based on its historical experience and any specific customer issues that have been identified. An allowance for doubtful;
accounts is provided against accounts receivable for amounts management believes may be uncollectible. The Company historically
has not had issues collecting on its accounts receivable from its customers. The Company factors certain of its receivables to
improve its cash flow.


December 31
 2018 and 2017 was $0; the allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31
 2018 and 2017 was $0.




and packaging supplies

cost
 net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life
of the assets. Maintenance
 repairs
 and renewals that do not materially add to the value of the equipment nor appreciably prolong
its useful life are charged to expense as incurred.




 2018
 the Company
implemented ASC 606
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Although the new revenue standard is expected to have an immaterial
impact
 if any
 on our ongoing net income
 we did implement changes to our processes related to revenue recognition and the control
activities within them. These included the development of new policies based on the five-step model provided in the new revenue
standard
 ongoing contract review requirements
 and gathering of information provided for disclosures.


product sales or services rendered when control of the promised goods are transferred to our clients in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. To achieve this core principle we
apply the following five steps: identify the contract with the client
 identify the performance obligations in the contract
 determine
the transaction price
 allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract and recognize revenues when or
as the Company satisfies a performance obligation.




advertising and marketing is to record the expense when incurred. The Company incurred advertising and marketing expenses of $3
424
and $2
015 during the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.




and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events
or changes in circumstances are present
 the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the
carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash
flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets
 the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying
amount over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair
value less costs to sell.




asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method
 deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based
on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently
enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that
 based on available evidence
are not expected to be realized.


with the consent of its stockholder
 had elected to be taxed as an S Corporation under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
Instead of paying federal corporate income taxes
 the stockholder(s) of an S Corporation are taxed individually on their proportionate
share of the Company&#8217;s taxable income. Therefore
 prior to the business combination discussed above
 the Company had made
no provision for income taxes. Effective with the business combination
 the wholly owned subsidiary became a C-corporation
 and
the loss incurred for the period as a C-corporation approximated $270
000. See Note 7.

for reporting and display of comprehensive income
 its components and accumulated balances. When applicable
 the Company would

from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The Company has not had any significant transactions that are required
to be reported in other comprehensive income.

 2018
 the Company
had cash and cash equivalents of $21
515 and an accumulated deficit of $23
734.&#160; Additionally
 the Company had accounts payable
and accrued liabilities of $357
909. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as
a going concern. The consolidated financials have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and
accordingly
 do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If the Company is in fact
unable to continue as a going concern
 the shareholders may lose some or all of their investment in the Company.
