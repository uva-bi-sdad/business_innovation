PART
I
ITEM
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;BUSINESS

COMPANY
OVERVIEW

Headquartered
in Jersey City
 New Jersey
 the Company engages in new product development
 production
 marketing
 distribution and sales of beverage
brands that are natural
 USDA Organic and Non GMO Project Verified.

CURRENT
OPERATIONS

Sales
and Distribution

The
Company began selling MOJO Naturals Pure Coconut Water in December 2015. In addition to Pure Coconut Water
 the Company produces
Coconut Water + Peach Mango Juice and Coconut Water + Pineapple Juice. We seek to grow the market share of our products by expanding
our distribution network through the relationships and efforts of our management and third party distribution relationships.

Production


The
Company has multiple sources for its products.&nbsp; The Company&rsquo;s fruit sources are of high quality and are part of the
overall taste and quality of its products. &nbsp;The Company&rsquo;s current arrangements for production and packaging exceed
required levels.



The
beverage industry is competitive.&nbsp;&nbsp;Competitors in our market compete for brand recognition
 ingredient sourcing
 qualified
personnel and product shelf space.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our competitors have similar distribution channels and retailers to deliver and
sell their products.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Government
Regulation

Within
the United States
 beverages are governed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &ldquo;FDA&rdquo;).&nbsp;&nbsp;As such
it is necessary for the Company to establish
 maintain and make available for inspection records as well as to develop labels
(including nutrition information) that meet legal food labeling requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&rsquo;s production facilities
are subject to FDA regulation.



As
of March 23
 2017
 the Company had three employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also uses the services of contractors
 consultants
and other third-parties. We contract with food brokers to represent our products to retail stores
 and in certain regions of the
United States
 we utilize the services of direct sales and distribution companies that sell our products to their customers. This
alleviates the need for a large sales and merchandising force.&nbsp;&nbsp;We use third-party manufacturing facilities to produce
our products and we outsource the storage and transportation of our products.

CORPORATE
HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT

On
January 20
 2016
 the Company approved a subscription agreement (the &ldquo;2016 Subscription&rdquo;) whereby shares of the Company&rsquo;s
common stock
 $0.001 par value (&ldquo;Common Stock&rdquo;) were offered to accredited investors for $0.35 per share. For every
two shares purchased
 the investor received a warrant to acquire one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.70 per share
exercisable for a period of two years from the date of issuance. The Company issued a total of 964
286 shares of Common Stock
and two year purchase warrants to acquire a total of 482
143 shares of Common Stock to four accredited investors for consideration
of $337
500.


    
    



In
August 2015
 the Company entered into a subscription agreement whereby 750
000 shares of Common Stock were sold to an accredited
investor for a total of $150
000
 along with a purchase warrant for 1
500
000 shares of Common Stock at a price of $0.40 per share.
The five year warrant is immediately exercisable.

On
October 20
 2015
 the Company filed a Form S-8 with the SEC registering an aggregate of 1
500
000 shares of Common Stock for the
issuance of shares under the 2015 Incentive Stock Plan (the &ldquo;2015 Plan&rdquo;).

ITEM
1A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RISK FACTORS

In
addition to the other information set forth in this report
 you should carefully consider the following factors
 which could materially
affect our business
 financial condition or results of operations in future periods. The risks described below are not the only
risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially
adversely affect our business
 financial condition or results of operations in future periods.

If
we are unable to expand our operations in the marketplace
 our growth rate could be negatively affected. 

Our
success depends in part on our ability to grow our business. We have adopted and implemented a strategic plan to increase awareness
of our products
 secure additional distribution channels
 and foster and strengthen our supply
 manufacturing and distribution
relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our strategic plan includes continuously anticipating and addressing changes in the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;There
can be no assurance that we will achieve the growth necessary to achieve our objectives.

We
may need additional capital in the future to expand our operations and execute our business objectives.

Should
we require additional capital to expand our operations
 financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities
or obtaining credit facilities.

The
challenges of competing with other beverage companies could result in reductions to our revenue and operating margins.

The
nonalcoholic beverage segment of the beverage industry is competitive. We compete with numerous beverage companies
 including
those marketing similar products. All beverages companies are competing for stomach share on a daily basis which is approximately
64 oz. of fluid per day or eight 8 oz. servings. Our success depends on our ability to secure distribution channels for our products
our ability to make consumers aware of our products and the appeal and popularity of our products to consumers.&nbsp;

Disruption
of supply
 increase in costs or shortage of ingredients could affect our operating results.

Availability
of supply and the prices charged by the producers of the ingredients used in our products can be affected by a variety of factors
including the general demand by other buyers for the same fruits used by us in our products
 and politics and economics in the
regions in which our fruits are grown.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The
quality of fruit we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis
 depending on supply and demand at the time of the purchase. An
increase in the pricing of any fruit that we use in our products may have an adverse effect on our margins. Higher energy costs
may affect the cost of transporting our supplies
 thereby increasing costs to us. Conversely
 lower fruit prices and energy prices
may have a positive result on transport and packaging costs. Any or all of these conditions could have an impact on our operating
margins.



    
    



We
use third party bottlers for the production and filling of our products and
 as such
 are subject to the bottler&rsquo;s production
and quality control. 

We
use third party bottlers for the production and filling of our products.&nbsp;&nbsp;While we play an active role in the production
of our products
 general supervision of the production process lies with the third party bottlers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly
 we
are dependent on the bottlers and their ability to meet production demands and to monitor and ensure product quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Litigation
and publicity concerning food quality
 health claims
 and other issues could expose us to significant liabilities.

Food
product businesses can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from customers or government authorities resulting from
food quality
 health claims
 allergens
 illness
 injury or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or more
products. Adverse publicity about these allegations may negatively affect us
 regardless of whether the allegations are true
by discouraging customers from buying our products.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition
 the food services industry has been subject to a growing
number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products they sell
 and disclosure and advertising practices. We may
also be subject to this type of proceeding in the future and
 even if not
 publicity about these matters may harm our reputation
or prospects and adversely affect our results.&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings
we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome may have an adverse impact on our business
and financial condition. In addition
 any litigation or regulatory proceedings may result in substantial costs and may require
that we devote substantial resources to the defense.

ITEM
1B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

Not
applicable.

ITEM
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;PROPERTIES

The
Company maintains office space in Jersey City
 New Jersey.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company leases the space from a third-party pursuant

230 per month. Subsequent to year end
 the Company signed a new
lease agreement for the period March 1
 2017 to February 28
 2018. The new rent under this agreement is $2
259 per month.

ITEM
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We
are currently not a party to any legal or administrative proceedings and are not aware of any pending or threatened legal or administrative
proceedings against us in all material aspects. We may from time to time become a party to various legal or administrative proceedings
arising in the ordinary course of our business.&nbsp;

7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MANAGEMENT&rsquo;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our
Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&ldquo;MD&amp;A&rdquo;) is provided
in addition to the accompanying financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations
 financial
condition and cash flows. MD&amp;A is organized as follows:



    
    
Critical
    Accounting Policies &mdash; Accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments
    incorporated in our reported financial results and forecasts.




    
    
Results
    of Operations &mdash; Analysis of our financial results comparing the year ended December 31
 2016 to 2015. 




    
    
Liquidity
    and Capital Resources &mdash; Analysis of changes in our cash flows
 and discussion of our financial condition and potential
    sources of liquidity.


This
report includes a number of forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial
performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward looking statements are often identified by words like: believe
 expect
 estimate
 anticipate
intend
 project and similar expressions
 or words which
 by their nature
 refer to future events.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should not place
undue certainty on these forward looking statements
 which apply only as of the date of this annual report.&nbsp;&nbsp;These forward
looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical
results or our predictions.

Critical
Accounting Policies

We
have prepared our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
 which
requires management to make significant judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during
the reporting period. We base these significant judgments and estimates on historical experience and other applicable assumptions
we believe to be reasonable based upon information presently available. These estimates may change as new events occur
 as additional
information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included
in the financial statements as soon as they became known. Actual results could materially differ from our estimates under different
assumptions
 judgments or conditions.

All
of our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 to our financial statements
included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We have identified the following as our critical accounting policies and estimates
which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties
 are the most pervasive and important
to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different
results under different assumptions
 judgments or conditions.

We
believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation
of our financial statements:

Use
&nbsp;&mdash; The financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States (&quot;GAAP&quot;). Management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Stock-based
&nbsp;&mdash; ASC Topic 718
&rdquo; prescribes accounting
and reporting standards for employee stock-based compensation plans
 including employee stock options
 restricted stock
 employee
stock purchase plans and stock appreciation rights.


    
    



ASC
Topic 718 requires employee compensation expense to be recorded using the fair value method. The Company accounts for employee
stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718.

Determining
the appropriate fair value of the stock-based compensation requires the input of subjective assumptions
 including the expected
life of the stock-based payment and stock price volatility. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing option model to
value its stock option awards which incorporate the Company&rsquo;s stock price
 volatility
 U.S. risk-free rate
 dividend rate
and estimated life.

The
Company accounts for equity based transactions with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic 505-50
 &ldquo;Equity-Based
Payments to Non-Employees.&rdquo; &nbsp;ASC Topic 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees
shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued
 whichever
is more reliably measurable. When the equity instrument is utilized for measurement the fair value of (i) common stock issued
for payments to non-employees is measured at the market price on the date of grant; (ii) equity instruments
 other than common
stock
 is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. In general
 we recognize an asset or expense in the same manner
as if it is to pay cash or services instead of paying with or using the equity instrument.

Fair
&nbsp;&mdash; Our short-term financial instruments
 including cash
 accounts receivable
accounts payable and other liabilities
 consist primarily of instruments without extended maturities. We believe that the fair
values of our current assets and current liabilities approximate their reported carrying amounts.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

Recent
accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force)
 the AICPA
 and the SEC
 did not
 or are
not believed by management
 to have a material impact on the Company's present or future financial statements.

 raw material costs and freight in costs.&nbsp; Also included
in Cost of Revenue are adjustments made to inventory carrying amounts
 including markdowns to market.

For
the year ended December 31
 2016
 cost of revenue was $741
898 or 56% of revenue
 compared to $551
847 or 279% of revenue for
the year ended December 31
 2015. During the year ended December 31
 2015
 the Company incurred expenses of $81
966 related to
the discontinuance of certain products
 which amount is included in cost of revenue.

Operating
Expenses

For
the year ended December 31
 2016
 selling
 general and administrative expenses were $1
858
089
 an increase of $6
838 over selling
general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31
 2015 of $1
851
251.&nbsp;&nbsp;

This
increase in selling
 general and administrative expenses of $6
838 was primarily comprised of an increase in compensation costs
of $415
394 and an increase in selling costs of $299
032
 offset by a decrease in stock based compensation costs of $655
558.


    
    



Compensation
costs increased by $415
394 in 2016 from 2015. This is primarily attributable to accrued stock bonuses of $160
000 and cash bonuses
of $165
600 earned by management as a result of the Company reaching certain revenue targets as part of their employment agreements.
The bonuses were unpaid as of December 31
 2016.

Selling
costs
 including freight and delivery expenses
 broker fees and outside sales fees increased by $299
032 from 2015 to 2016. This
is a result of the corresponding increase in sales for 2016.

Stock-based
compensation costs to directors and employees
 which consist of charges to income for vesting in connection with restricted stock
issuances
 stock options and warrants
 were $511
231 for the year ended December 31
 2016
 compared to $1
166
789 for the year
ended December 30
 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp; This represents a reduction in selling
 general and administrative expenses of $655
558.
Although stock-based compensation costs reduce the Company&rsquo;s earnings
 they do not reduce cash and have no effect on working
capital.

The
termination of a license agreement resulted in a reduction to operating expenses of $417
223 for the year ended December 31
 2015.
See Note 4 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for further discussion.


Liquidity
and Capital Resources



As
of December 31
 2016
 the Company had a working capital deficiency of $113
651
 which included the estimated value of a
stock bonus payable of 400
000 shares of Common Stock. For financial reporting purposes
 the value of the stock bonus
was calculated at $160
000 based upon the closing price of the Company&rsquo;s Common Stock on December 31
 2016 at $0.40
per share. Net cash used in operating activities was $314
274 for the year ended December 31
 2016
 a decrease of $164
373
over net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31
 2015 of $478
647. Net cash provided by
financing activities was $337
500 for the year ended December 31
 2016 compared to $150
000 for the year ended December
31
 2015.

Working
Capital Needs

Our
working capital requirements increase as demand grows for our products. Due to an increased demand
 the Company raised $337
500
in January and February 2016 through the issuance of Common Stock and warrants. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Financial Statements
for further discussion. If during the next twelve months the Company requires additional working capital
 it may seek to raise
funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;Financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities or obtaining
credit facilities.

ITEM
9A. &nbsp;CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures&nbsp;

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure
controls and procedures include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;)
is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management
 including its principal executive and principal financial officers
or persons performing similar functions
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. It should be
noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions
regardless of how remote.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of the Company&rsquo;s senior management
 consisting of the Company&rsquo;s principal
executive and financial officer and the Company&rsquo;s principal accounting officer
 the Company conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures
 as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report (the &ldquo;Evaluation Date&rdquo;). Based on this evaluation
the Company&rsquo;s principal executive and financial officer concluded
 as of the Evaluation Date
 that the Company&rsquo;s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective.

Management&rsquo;s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The
management of MOJO Organics
 Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Therefore
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. In
evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
 our management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on this
evaluation
 our officers concluded that
 during the period covered by this annual report
 our internal controls over financial
reporting were not operating effectively.

As
previously reported
 the Company does not have an audit committee and is not currently obligated to have one. Management does
not believe that the lack of an audit committee is a material weakness.


Attestation
Report

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting as such report is not required for non-accelerated filers.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during the year ended December 31
 2016 that have materially affected
or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal controls over financial reporting.

ITEM
13.&nbsp;&nbsp;CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
 AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE

Other
than as disclosed below and in this Form 10-K
 there have been no transactions
 since January 1
 2015
 or any currently proposed
transaction
 in which we were or are to be a participant and the amount involved exceeds the lesser of $120
000 or 1% of the average
of our total assets at year end for the last two completed fiscal years and in which any of our directors
 executive officers
or beneficial holders of more than 5% of our outstanding Common Stock

On
March 3
 2017
 the Company entered into an amendment to the Spinner Agreement effective December 31

Bonus Plan by 1
500
000 shares.

In
connection with two private placement offerings in March 2014
 investors received one purchase warrant at $0.91 per share for
each share of stock purchased. The warrants issued to Wyatts were incorrectly calculated. On March 6
 2017
 the
Company issued warrants to purchase 915
447 shares of Common Stock at $0.91 per share to Wyatts to correct for this error.
There was no financial impact resulting from this warrant understatement other than an understatement of potentially dilutive shares.

In
January 2016
 Wyatts purchased 285
715 shares of Common Stock pursuant to the 2016 Subscription. The purchase price of the shares

858 shares at a price of $0.70 per share. The five year warrant is
immediately exercisable.

000
 along with a purchase warrant for 1
500
000 shares of Common Stock
at a price of $0.40 per share. The five year warrant is immediately exercisable.

On

 2015

1

4
 2013 and all obligations set forth therein; (ii) that Seet will return stock certificates representing 1
165
251 shares of
Common Stock of the Company that would have vested upon certain revenue milestones to the Company for cancellation; (iii) the
Company will issue to Seet settlement shares of the Company which will be subject to a certain lock up legend providing that Seet
may only sell 145
656 of the settlement shares per quarter upon the Rule 144 holding period being satisfied and upon the Company
generating a minimum of $5
000
000 in revenue during any 12 month period; and (iv) Seet will provide the Company with a release

Director
Independence

We
are not currently subject to listing requirements of any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system which has
requirements that a majority of the board of directors be &ldquo;independent&rdquo; and
 as a result
 we are not at this time
required to (and we do not) have our Board of Directors comprised of a majority of &ldquo;Independent Directors.&rdquo;

Our
Board of Directors has considered the independence of its directors in reference to the definition of &ldquo;independent director&rdquo;
established by the Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5605(a)(2). In doing so
 the Board of Directors has reviewed all commercial and other
relationships of each director in making its determination as to the independence of its directors. After such review
 the Board
of Directors has determined that Mr. Devlin and Mr. Kaufman qualify as independent under the requirements of the Nasdaq listing
standards.

REPORT
                                         OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Mojo Organics
 Inc.
We
have audited the accompanying balance sheet of MOJO Organics
 Inc. as of December 31
 2016
 and the related statements of operations
changes in stockholders&rsquo; equity/deficit
 and cash flows for the year then ended. MOJO Organics
 Inc.&rsquo;s management
is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audit.
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. The company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company&rsquo;s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining
 on a test
basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
 assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In
our opinion
 the financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of MOJO
Organics
 Inc. as of December 31
 2016
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended
 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

NOTE
2 &ndash; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use
of Estimates
The
financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(&quot;GAAP&quot;). Management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents
Cash
equivalents include investment instruments and time deposits purchased with a maturity of three months or less.

Accounts
Receivable
Accounts
receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. The Company provides for probable
uncollectible amounts based upon its assessment of the current status of the individual receivables and after using reasonable
collection efforts. The allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31
 2016 and 2015 was zero and $3
000
 respectively.


Inventories
consisting solely of finished goods
 are stated at the lower of cost (first-in
 first-out method) or market. When necessary
 the
Company provides allowances to adjust the carrying value of its inventories to the lower of cost or net realizable value.

Supplier
Deposits
Supplier
Deposits consist of prepaid inventory for which the Company has not yet taken delivery.

Property
and Equipment and Depreciation
Property
and equipment are stated at cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;Depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful
life of the respective assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer equipment is depreciated over a period of 3 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer software
is depreciated over a one year period. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;When property
and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of
 the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective
accounts and any gain or loss is credited or charged to income.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Revenue
Recognition
Revenues
from sales of products are recognized when title and risk of loss passes to the customer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognition of revenue also
requires reasonable assurance of collection of sales proceeds.

Deductions
from Revenue
Costs
incurred for sales incentives and discounts are accounted for as a reduction in revenue. These costs include payments to customers
for performing merchandising activities on our behalf
 including in-store displays
 promotions for new items and obtaining optimum
shelf space.



    
    


Shipping
and Handling Costs
Shipping
and Handling Costs incurred to move finished goods from our sales distribution centers to customer locations are included in the
line Selling
 General and Administrative Expenses in our Statements of Operations.

Net
Loss Per Common Share
The
Company computes per share amounts in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) Accounting
Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) Topic 260
&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;ASC Topic 260 requires
presentation of basic and diluted EPS.&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic EPS is computed by dividing the income (loss) available to common stockholders
by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.&nbsp;&nbsp;Diluted EPS is based on the weighted average
number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the periods.

The
following potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computation of weighted average shares outstanding for the
years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015
 as they would have had an anti-dilutive impact on the Company&rsquo;s net loss per common
share:

Income
Taxes
The
Company provides for income taxes under ASC topic 740
 &ldquo;
&rdquo; which requires the use of an asset and
liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between
the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected
to reverse. ASC Topic 740 also requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if
 based on the weight
of available evidence
 it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Tax returns
for the years from 2010 to 2015 are subject to examination by tax authorities.

The
Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of December 31
 2016 and
2015
 the Company had no accrued interest or penalties. The Company has had no Federal or state tax examinations in the past nor
does it have any at the current time.

Stock-Based
Compensation
ASC
Topic 718
&rdquo; prescribes accounting and reporting standards for employee
stock-based compensation plans
 including employee stock options
 restricted stock
 employee stock purchase plans and stock appreciation
rights. ASC Topic 718 requires employee compensation expense to be recorded using the fair value method. The Company&nbsp;accounts
for employee stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions&nbsp;of ASC Topic 718.

The
Company accounts for equity based transactions with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic 505-50
 &ldquo;Equity-Based
Payments to Non-Employees.&rdquo; &nbsp;ASC Topic 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees
shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued
 whichever
is more reliably measurable. When the equity instrument is utilized for measurement the fair value of (i) common stock issued
for payments to non-employees is measured at the market price on the date of grant; (ii) equity instruments
 other than common
stock
 is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. In general
 we recognize an asset or expense in the same manner
as if it is to pay cash or services instead of paying with or using the equity instrument.

Fair
value of financial instruments
The
carrying amounts of financial instruments
 which include cash
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate
their fair values due to their short-term nature.


    
    



New
Accounting Pronouncements
In
May 2014
 FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&ldquo;ASU&rdquo;) No. 2014-09
 which creates ASC Topic 606

from Contracts with Customers&rdquo;
 and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605

Recognition&rdquo;
 including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification.
In addition
 ASU 2014-09 supersedes the cost guidance in Subtopic 605-35

and Production-Type Contracts
&rdquo; and creates new Subtopic 340-40

with Customers
 the core principle of ASC Topic 606 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services
are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services.
The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim
periods within that reporting period
 and early application is not permitted. Therefore the amendments in ASU 2014-09 will become
effective for us as of the beginning of our 2017 fiscal year. The Company is currently assessing the impact of implementing the
new guidance.

In
June 2014
 FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12

Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period&rdquo;.

of the award provide that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period. The
amendments require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period
must be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718 as it relates to awards
with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. For all entities
 the amendments in this ASU are effective
for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15
 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier adoption
is permitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-12 on the Company's financial
statements.

In
August 2014
 FASB issued ASU 2014-15
 (Subtopic 205-40) &ndash;
&rdquo;. Currently
 there is
no
guidance
in GAAP about management&rsquo;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&rsquo;s ability
to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this ASU provide that guidance. In
doing so
 the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require
management to assess an entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles
that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically

doubt
 
 (3) provide principles for considering
the mitigating effect of management&rsquo;s plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result
of consideration of management&rsquo;s plans
 (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is
not alleviated
 and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued
(or available to be issued). The amendments in this ASU are effective for public and nonpublic entities for annual periods ending
after December 15
 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-15
on the Company&rsquo;s financial statements.

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued
 but not yet effective accounting standards
 if currently adopted
 would have
a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.


Certain
amounts in the 2015 Financial Statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in the 2016 Financial Statements.


NOTE
3 &ndash; INCOME TAX

The
Company accounts for income taxes under the assets and liability method.&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible
temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for
taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and their tax bases.&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred tax assets are&nbsp;&nbsp;reduced by a&nbsp;&nbsp;valuation&nbsp;&nbsp;allowance&nbsp;&nbsp;when
&nbsp;&nbsp;in
the opinion&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;management
&nbsp;&nbsp;it is more&nbsp;&nbsp;likely&nbsp;&nbsp;than not&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;some
portion or all of the deferred&nbsp;&nbsp;tax assets will not be realized.


    
    



The
reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory rate of 34% to the provision for income taxes recorded in the Statements of Operations
is as follows:




    
Year

An
income tax benefit has not been recognized for operating losses generated in prior periods based on uncertainties concerning the
ability to generate taxable income in future periods.&nbsp;&nbsp;At December 31
 2016
 the Company had available net operating
loss carry-forwards of approximately $5
268
748 which expire in various years through the year ending December 31
 2036.&nbsp;&nbsp;Utilization
of the tax loss carry-forwards are not assured
 however
 because the Company has incurred significant operating losses.&nbsp;
As a result
 the deferred income tax asset arising from these net operating loss carry-forwards and from other temporary differences
are not recorded in the accompanying Balance Sheets.&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the uncertainty of the Company&rsquo;s realization of this
benefit
 a valuation allowance was established to fully reserve such assets. The valuation allowance increased by $502
095 and
$708
052 for the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015
 respectively.

During
the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015
 compensation expense of $45
097 and $77
135
 respectively
 was recorded. As of December
31
 2016
 there was $1
330 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options. That cost is expected
to be recognized in 2017.


    
    


The
aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable at December 31
 2016 and 2015 was $89
900 and $151
900
 respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;Aggregate
intrinsic value represents the difference between the Company's closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal period
which was $0.40 and&nbsp;$0.50 as of December 31
 2016 and 2015
 respectively
 and the exercise price multiplied by the number
of options outstanding.&nbsp;

NOTE
7 &ndash; CONCENTRATIONS

Major
Customers
During
the year ended December 31
 2016
 the Company had two customers that accounted for approximately 45% and 16% of revenue. Accounts
receivable at December 31
 2016 from these two customers amounted to $12
494 and zero
 respectively. For the year ended December
31
 2015
 there were no major customers accounting for more than 10% of total revenue.

Major
Suppliers
During
the year ended December 31
 2016
 the Company purchased its inventory from a single supplier. The Company has established relationships
with other suppliers which management believes could meet its needs on similar terms. Accounts payable at December 31
 2016 to
this supplier was zero. At December 31
 2016
 the supplier owed the Company $14
381
 which amount was included in prepaid expenses.


NOTE
8 &ndash; RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

As
of December 31
 2016
 accrued payroll of $484
600 was payable to the Chief Executive Officer (the &ldquo;CEO&rdquo;) and the Chief
Operating Officer (the &ldquo;COO&rdquo;). This amount included unpaid bonus as well as unpaid salary. As of December 31
 2015
accrued payroll of $3
050 was payable to the CEO
 COO and Controller (and Principal Accounting Officer) of the Company.

During
2016
 the CEO and the COO forgave unpaid salary due to them of $96
000 and $81
000
 respectively. During 2015
 the CEO
the COO and the Controller of the Company forgave unpaid salary due to them of $307
000
 $85
000
 and $43
032
 respectively.
This resulted in increases to additional paid in capital of $177
000 and $435
032 for the years ended December 31
 2016 and
2015
 respectively.

In
January 2016
 the Company sold 285
715 shares of Common Stock and warrants to purchase 142
857 shares of Common Stock at $0.70
per share to Wyatts Torch Equity Partners
 LP (&ldquo;Wyatts&rdquo;) for $100
000 pursuant to the 2016 Subscription. The managing
member of Wyatts is the COO of the Company
 as well as a Director of the Company.


    
    



In
August 2015
 the Company issued its Controller 226
485 shares of Common Stock of the Company in consideration of her previous
and continued services as Controller of the Company. These shares will vest&nbsp;upon the Company generating revenue of $3
000
000
during any twelve month period on or prior to June 26
 2025.

Also
in August 2015
 the Company entered into the 2015 Subscription with Wyatts for the sale of 750
000 shares of Common Stock for
$150
000 and warrants to purchase 1
500
000 shares of Common Stock at $0.40 per share. See Note 5 for further discussion.

NOTE
9 &ndash; SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

In
accordance with ASC Topic 855

&rdquo; 
after the balance sheet date for potential recognition in the financial statements. The effects of all subsequent events that
provide additional evidence of conditions that existed at the balance sheet date are recognized in the financial statements as
of December 31
 2016. In preparing these financial statements
 the Company evaluated the events and transactions that occurred
through the date these financial statements were issued.&nbsp;

On
March 3
 2017
 the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Peter Spinner
 reducing the eligible
bonus shares by 1
500
000 shares.

In
connection with two private placement offerings in March 2014
 investors received one purchase warrant at $0.91 per share
for each share of Common Stock purchased. The warrants issued to Wyatts were incorrectly calculated. On March 6
 2017
 the
Company issued warrants to purchase 915
447 shares of Common Stock at $0.91 per share to Wyatts to correct for this error. There was no financial impact resulting from this warrant understatement other than an understatement of potentially dilutive shares.

&#13;&amp;#8220;&lt;i&gt;Compensation &amp;#8211; Stock Compensation (Topic 718); Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide&#13;That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period&amp;#8221;. &lt;/i&gt;The amendments in this ASU apply to&#13;all reporting entities that grant their employees share-based payments in which the terms of the award provide that a performance&#13;target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period. The amendments require that a performance target&#13;that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period must be treated as a performance condition.&#13;A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect&#13;vesting to account for such awards. For all entities
 the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods and interim periods&#13;within those annual periods beginning after December 15

The amendments in this ASU provide that guidance. In doing so
 the amendments are intended to reduce diversity&#13;in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity&amp;#8217;s ability to continue&#13;as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically
&#13;the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term &lt;i&gt;substantial doubt
 &lt;/i&gt;(2) require an evaluation every reporting period&#13;including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management&amp;#8217;s plans
 (4) require&#13;certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&amp;#8217;s plans
 (5) require&#13;an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated

 the Company had available net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $5
268
748&#13;which expire in various years through the year ending December 31
 2036.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Utilization of the tax loss carry-forwards&#13;are not assured
 however
 because the Company has incurred significant operating losses.&amp;#160; As a result
 the deferred income&#13;tax asset arising from these net operating loss carry-forwards and from other temporary differences are not recorded in the accompanying&#13;Balance Sheets.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Due to the uncertainty of the Company&amp;#8217;s realization of this benefit
 a valuation allowance was&#13;established to fully reserve such assets. The valuation allowance increased by $502
095 and $708
052 for the years ended December&#13;31
 2016 and 2015
