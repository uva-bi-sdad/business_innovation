PART
I
ITEM
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;BUSINESS

COMPANY
OVERVIEW

MOJO
Organics
 Inc. (&ldquo;MOJO&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) a Delaware Corporation is headquartered in Jersey City
 NJ. The
Company engages in new product development
 production
 marketing
 distribution and sales of beverage brands that are natural
and Non GMO Project Verified.

CURRENT
OPERATIONS

Sales
and Distribution

The
Company flagship product is MOJO Pure Coconut Water. In addition to Pure Coconut Water
 the Company produced Sparkling Coconut
Water
 Coconut Water + Peach Mango Juice and Coconut Water + Pineapple Juice in 2018. We seek to grow the market share of our
products by expanding our hybrid distribution network through the relationships and efforts of our management and third party
distribution relationships
 an improved broker network
 and new products and packaging in 2019.

Production


The
Company has multiple sources for its production.&nbsp; The Company&rsquo;s fruit sources are of high quality and are part of the
overall taste and quality of our products. &nbsp;Currently
 the Company has 3 production facilities that it could source products
from
 each of the facilities could supply our forecasted demand for 2019&nbsp;.



The
beverage industry is competitive.&nbsp;&nbsp;Competitors in our market compete for brand recognition
 ingredient sourcing
 product
shelf space
 and e-commerce page rankings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our competitors have similar distribution channels and retailers to deliver
and sell their products.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Government
Regulation

Within
the United States
 beverages are governed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &ldquo;FDA&rdquo;).&nbsp;&nbsp;As such
it is necessary for the Company to establish
 maintain and make available for inspection records as well as to develop labels
(including nutrition information) that meet FDA requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&rsquo;s production facilities are subject
to FDA regulation.



As
of December 31
 2018
 the Company had three employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also uses the services of contractors
 consultants
and other third-parties. We contract with food brokers to represent our products to specific specialized sales channels. We utilize
the services of direct sales and distribution companies that deliver and sell our products to their customers. We contract with
manufacturing facilities to produce our products and outsource the storage and transportation of our products.

CORPORATE
HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT

The
Company was incorporated in 2007. MOJO Organics Inc is headquartered in Jersey City
 and our internet site is www.mojoorganicsinc.com.
MOJO&rsquo;s stock is traded on the OTC Markets under the symbol &ldquo;MOJO&rdquo;.



    
    


ITEM
1A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RISK FACTORS

In
addition to the other information set forth in this report
 you should consider the following factors
 which could materially
affect our business
 financial condition or results of operations in future periods. The risks described below are not the only
risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially
adversely affect our business
 financial condition or results of operations in future periods.

If
we are unable to expand our operations in the marketplace
 our growth rate could be negatively affected. 

Our
success depends in part on our ability to grow our business. We have adopted and implemented a strategic plan to increase awareness
of our products
 secure additional distribution channels
 and foster and strengthen our supply
 manufacturing and distribution
relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our strategic plan includes addressing changes in the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;There can be no assurance
that we will achieve the growth necessary to achieve our objectives.

We
could need additional capital in the future to expand our operations and execute our business objectives.

Should
we need additional capital to expand our operations
 financing transactions may include the issuance of equity
 debt securities
and obtaining credit facilities.

The
challenges of competing with other beverage companies could result in reductions to our revenue and operating margins.

The
nonalcoholic beverage segment of the beverage industry is competitive. We compete with numerous beverage companies
 including
those marketing similar products. All beverages companies are competing for stomach share on a daily basis which is approximately
64 oz. of fluid per day
 per person. Our success depends on our ability to secure distribution channels for our products
 our
ability to make consumers aware of our products and the appeal of our products to consumers.&nbsp;

Disruption
of supply
 increase in costs or shortage of ingredients could affect our operating results.

Availability
of supply and the prices charged by the producers of production inputs used in our products can be affected by a variety of factors
including the general demand by other buyers for the same fruits used by us in our products
 and politics and economics in the
regions in which our fruit is grown.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The
quality of fruit we seek trades on a negotiated basis
 depending on supply and demand at the time of the purchase. An increase
in the pricing of any fruit that we use in our products will have a negative effect on our margins. Higher energy costs may affect
the cost of transporting our supplies
 thereby increasing costs. Conversely
 lower fruit prices and energy prices will have a
positive result on transport and packaging costs.


    
    



We
use independent bottlers for the production of our products and
 as such
 are subject to the bottler&rsquo;s production and quality
control. 

We
use independent bottlers for the production of our products.&nbsp;&nbsp;We play an active&nbsp; rold in the production of our
beverages
 which includes but is not limited to developing our formulations
 maintaining control over the labeling and packaging
of our beverates
 independent UAL testing of our products for safetly
 and packaging and function of our packaging and correct
FDA labeling. We also review and monitor the safety certifications of the factories including their status with the United States
Food and Drug Administration. We also inspect the warehouses that our products are stored in
 and monitor the trucking companies
that deliver our goods.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly
 we are dependent on the bottlers and their ability to meet production demands
and to achieve product quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Litigation
and publicity concerning food quality
 health claims
 and other issues could expose us to significant liabilities.

The
packaged food industry can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from customers and government authorities resulting
from product quality
 health claims
 allergens
 illness
 and injury. Adverse publicity about these allegations may negatively
affect the Company
 regardless of whether the allegations are true. In addition
 the food industry has been subject to a number
of claims based on the nutritional content of food products they sell
 and disclosure and advertising practices. Due to the inherent
uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings
 we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable
outcome will have an adverse impact on our business. In addition
 any litigation or regulatory proceedings may result in substantial
costs.

Our
Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&ldquo;MD&amp;A&rdquo;) is provided
in addition to the accompanying financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations
 financial
condition and cash flows. MD&amp;A is organized as follows:



    
    
Significant Accounting
    Policies &mdash; Accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated
    in our reported financial results and forecasts.

 and discussion of our financial condition and potential sources of
    liquidity.


This
report includes a number of forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial
performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward looking statements are often identified by words like: believe
 expect
 estimate
 anticipate
intend
 project and similar expressions
 or words which
 by their nature
 refer to future events.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should not place
undue certainty on these forward looking statements
 which apply only as of the date of this annual report.&nbsp;&nbsp;These forward
looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical
results or our predictions.

Significant
Accounting Policies

We
have prepared our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
 which
requires management to make significant judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during
the reporting period. We base these significant judgments and estimates on historical experience and other applicable assumptions
we believe to be reasonable based upon information presently available. These estimates may change as new events occur
 as additional
information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included
in the financial statements as soon as they became known. Actual results could materially differ from our estimates under different
assumptions
 judgments or conditions.

All
of our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 to our financial statements
included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We have identified the following as our significant accounting policies and estimates
which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties
 are the most pervasive and important
to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different
results under different assumptions
 judgments or conditions.

We
believe the following significant accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation
of our financial statements:

Use
&nbsp;&mdash; The financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States (&quot;GAAP&quot;). Management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Stock-based
&nbsp;&mdash; ASC Topic 718
&rdquo; prescribes accounting
and reporting standards for employee stock-based compensation plans
 including employee stock options
 restricted stock
 employee
stock purchase plans and stock appreciation rights.


    
    



ASC
Topic 718 requires employee compensation expense to be recorded using the fair value method. The Company accounts for employee
stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718.&nbsp;

Determining
the appropriate fair value of the stock-based compensation requires the input of subjective assumptions
 including the expected
life of the stock-based payment and stock price volatility. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing option model to
value its stock option awards which incorporate the Company&rsquo;s stock price
 volatility
 U.S. risk-free rate
 dividend rate
and estimated life.

The
Company accounts for equity based transactions with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic 505-50
 &ldquo;Equity-Based
Payments to Non-Employees.&rdquo; &nbsp;ASC Topic 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees
shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued
 whichever
is more reliably measurable. When the equity instrument is utilized for measurement the fair value of (i) common stock issued
for payments to non-employees is measured at the market price on the date of grant; (ii) equity instruments
 other than common
stock
 is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. In general
 we recognize an asset or expense in the same manner
as if it is to pay cash or services instead of paying with or using the equity instrument.

Fair
&nbsp;&mdash; Our short-term financial instruments
 including cash
 accounts receivable
accounts payable and other liabilities
 consist primarily of instruments without extended maturities. We believe that the fair
values of our current assets and current liabilities approximate their reported carrying amounts.

Results
of Operations

Years
Ended December 31
 2018 and 2017



During
the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Company reported revenue of $1
688
827
 an increase of $374
105 or 28% over revenue of $1
314
722
for the year ended December 31
 2017. The increase in revenue was due to higher dollar sales in MOJO branded products and to a
lesser extent the MOJO private label business. We also saw growth in same store sales. Also
 the addition of new accounts opened
added to the growth of revenue in 2018.

Cost
of Revenue

Cost
of Revenue includes finished goods purchase costs
 and freight in costs.&nbsp; Also included in Cost of Revenue are adjustments
made to inventory carrying amounts
 if required.

For
the year ended December 31
 2018
 cost of revenue was $898
806 or 53% of revenue
 compared to $786
914 or 60% of revenue for the
year ended December 31
 2017. The positive decrease is due primarily to the lower purchase price of inventory.


    
    



Operating
Expenses

 general and administrative expenses was $1
213
281
 a decrease of $549
630 from the
year ended December 31
 2017 of $1
762
876.&nbsp;

This
decrease in operating expenses was primarily comprised of a decrease in compensation costs offset partially by an increase in
selling costs
 professional and consulting fees. Compensation costs decreased by $835
600 in 2018 from 2017. This is primarily
attributable to lower stock compensation costs. Selling costs
 including freight and delivery expenses
 broker fees and warehouse
costs increased by $168
150 from 2017 to 2018. This was partially due to an increase in sales volume. Professional fees and consulting
fees also increased in 2018 by $22
276 and $50
683 respectively.

 which consist of charges to income for vesting in connection with restricted stock

ITEM
9A. &nbsp;CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures&nbsp;

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure
controls and procedures include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;)
is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management
 including its principal executive and principal financial officers
or persons performing similar functions
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. It should be
noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions
regardless of how remote.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of the Company&rsquo;s senior management
 consisting of the Company&rsquo;s principal
executive and financial officer and the Company&rsquo;s principal accounting officer
 the Company conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures
 as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report (the &ldquo;Evaluation Date&rdquo;). Based on this evaluation
the Company&rsquo;s principal executive and financial officer concluded
 as of the Evaluation Date
 that the Company&rsquo;s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective.

Management&rsquo;s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The
management of MOJO Organics
 Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Therefore
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. In
evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
 our management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on this
evaluation
 our officers concluded that
 during the period covered by this annual report
 our internal controls over financial
reporting were not operating effectively.

As
previously reported
 the Company does not have an audit committee and is not currently obligated to have one. Management does
not believe that the lack of an audit committee is a material weakness.

Attestation
Report

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting as such report is not required for non-accelerated filers.


Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during the year ended December 31
 2018 that have materially affected
or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal controls over financial reporting.

2012
Plan
In

stock options
 stock appreciation rights
 restricted stock and/or other stock-based awards for up to an aggregate of 2
050
000
shares of common stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2016
 the Company issued 620
000 stock options to purchase shares of common stock that expire
in August 2019
 and issued 1
073
441
restricted common stock to its Directors and employees. In 2017
 the Company granted stock
options to purchase 356
559 shares that expire in April 2022. The options were priced at the fair market value of the Common Stock
and are exercisable. In 2018
 there were no issuances under the 2012 plan. As of December 31
 2018
 issued stock options total
976
559. During 2018
 495
403 stock options have been cancelled due to termination of employment. The remaining 495
403 options
are available to be issued at December 31
 2018.

The
2012 Plan was terminated by the Board of Directors on February 18
 2019.

2015
Plan
In
October 2015
 the Company approved the 2015 Plan
 which provides the Company with the ability to issue stock options
 stock awards
and/or restricted stock purchase&nbsp;offers for up to an aggregate of 1
500
000 shares of Common Stock. On April

ITEM
13.&nbsp;&nbsp;CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
 AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE

Other
than as disclosed below and in this Form 10-K
 there have been no transactions
 since January 1
 2018
 or any currently proposed
transaction
 in which we were or are to be a participant and the amount involved exceeds the lesser of $120
000 or 1% of the average
of our total assets at year end for the last two completed fiscal years and in which any of our directors
 executive officers
or beneficial holders of more than 5% of our outstanding Common Stock
 or any of their respective immediate family members
 has
had or will have any direct or material indirect interest.&nbsp;

On
March 2
 2017
 the Company entered into an amendment to the Spinner Agreement effective December 31
 2016 reducing the Spinner
Bonus Plan by 1
500
000 shares.

In
connection with two private placement offerings in March 2014
 investors received one purchase warrant at $0.91 per share for
each share of stock purchased. The warrants issued to Wyatts were incorrectly calculated. On March 6
 2017
 the Company issued
warrants to purchase 915
447 shares of Common Stock at $0.91 per share to Wyatts to correct for this error. There was no financial
impact resulting from this warrant understatement other than an understatement of potentially dilutive shares.


    
    


In
January 2016
 Wyatts purchased 285
715 shares of Common Stock pursuant to the 2016 Subscription. The purchase price of the shares
was $0.35 per share
 and included purchase warrants for 142
858 shares at a price of $0.70 per share. The two year warrant was
immediately exercisable and expired on January 26
 2018.

In
August 2015
 the Company entered into a subscription agreement (the &ldquo;2015 Subscription&rdquo;) whereby 750
000 shares of
Common Stock were sold to Wyatts
 for a total of $150
000
 along with a purchase warrant for 1
500
000 shares of Common Stock
at a price of $0.40 per share. The five year warrant is immediately exercisable and expires on August 17
 2020.

Director
Independence

We
are not currently subject to listing requirements of any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system which has
requirements that a majority of the board of directors be &ldquo;independent&rdquo; and
 as a result
 we are not at this time
required to (and we do not) have our Board of Directors comprised of a majority of &ldquo;Independent Directors.&rdquo;

Our
Board of Directors has considered the independence of its directors in reference to the definition of &ldquo;independent director&rdquo;
established by the Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5605(a)(2). In doing so
 the Board of Directors has reviewed all commercial and other
relationships of each director in making its determination as to the independence of its directors. After such review
 the Board
of Directors has determined that Mr. Devlin and Mr. Kaufman qualify as independent under the requirements of the Nasdaq listing
standards.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the shareholders and directors of
MOJO Organics
 Inc.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of MOJO Organics
 Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
the related statements of operations
 changes in stockholders&rsquo; equity/deficit
 and cash flows for each of the two years
in the period ended December 31
 2018
 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;financial statements&rdquo;).
In our opinion
 the financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;
as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period
ended December 31
 2018
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis
for Opinion

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company&rsquo;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) and are required to be independent wih respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error
or fraud. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal controls over financial reporting.
Accordingly
 we express no such opinion.

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to
error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Notes
to Financial Statements
December
31 2018 and 2017

NOTE
1 &ndash; BUSINESS 



MOJO

 NJ. The
Company engages in new product development

 distribution and sales of beverage brands that are natural
and Non GMO Project verified. The Company flagship product is MOJO Pure Coconut Water. In addition to Pure Coconut Water
 the
Company produced Sparkling Coconut Water

NOTE
2 &ndash; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use
of Estimates

The
financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(&quot;GAAP&quot;). Management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

Cash
equivalents include investment instruments and time deposits purchased with a maturity of three months or less. As of December
31
 2018 and December 31
 2017
 the Company did not have any cash equivalents.

Accounts
Receivable

Accounts
receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. The Company provides for probable
uncollectible amounts based upon its assessment of the current status of the individual receivables and after using reasonable
collection efforts. The allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31
 2018 and 2017 was zero.



Inventories
consisting solely of finished goods
 are stated at the lower of cost (first-in
 first-out method) or net realizable value (&ldquo;NRV&rdquo;).
If necessary
As
of December 31
 2018
 inventories consist solely of purchased finished goods.

Revenue
Recognition

Revenue
from sales of products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 delivery of products has occurred
 the
sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Costs incurred for sales incentives and discounts
are accounted for as a reduction in revenue.

Deductions
from Revenue

Costs
incurred for sales incentives and discounts are accounted for as a reduction in revenue. These costs include payments to customers
for performing merchandising activities on our behalf
 including in-store displays
 promotions for new items and obtaining optimum
shelf space.



    
    


Shipping
and Handling Costs

Shipping
and Handling Costs incurred to move finished goods from our sales distribution centers to customer locations are included in the
line Selling
 General and Administrative Expenses in our Statements of Operations.

Net
Loss Per Common Share

The
Company computes per share amounts in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) Accounting
Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) Topic 260
&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;ASC Topic 260 requires
presentation of basic and diluted EPS.&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic EPS is computed by dividing the income (loss) available to common stockholders
by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.&nbsp;&nbsp;Diluted EPS is based on the weighted average
number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the periods.

The
following potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computation of weighted average shares outstanding as they
would have had an anti-dilutive impact on the Company&rsquo;s net loss per common share:

Income
Taxes 

The
Company provides for income taxes using the asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and
the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance
if
 based on the weight of available evidence
 it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not
be realized.

The
Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of December 31
 2018 and
December 31
 2017
 the Company had no accrued interest or penalties. The Company has had no Federal or state tax examinations
in the past nor does it have any at the current time. As of December 31
 2018
 the Company has a Net Operating Loss Carryforward
of 4
736
851 and recognized an Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets amounting to 1
237
976. The Company does not expect the allowance
to be reversed within the coming periods.

In
2018
 as a result of the 2017 Tax Act
 we recognized a provisional tax benefit of 956
326 due to the re-measeurement of certain
deferred taxes to the lower U.S. federal tax rate.


    
    


Stock-Based
Compensation

ASC
Topic 718
&rdquo; prescribes accounting and reporting standards for employee
stock-based compensation plans
 including employee stock options
 restricted stock
 employee stock purchase plans and stock appreciation
rights. ASC Topic 718 requires employee compensation expense to be recorded using the fair value method. The Company&nbsp;accounts
for employee stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions&nbsp;of ASC Topic 718.

The
Company accounts for equity based transactions with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic 505-50
 &ldquo;Equity-Based
Payments to Non-Employees.&rdquo; &nbsp;ASC Topic 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees
shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued
 whichever
is more reliably measurable. When the equity instrument is utilized for measurement the fair value of (i) common stock issued
for payments to non-employees is measured at the market price on the date of grant; (ii) equity instruments
 other than common
stock
 is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. In general
 we recognize an asset or expense in the same manner
as if it is to pay cash or services instead of paying with or using the equity instrument.

Fair
value of financial instruments

The
carrying amounts of financial instruments
 which include cash
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate
their fair values due to their short-term nature.

New
Accounting Pronouncements

In
June 2018 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-07

&ndash; Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting.
several aspects of the accounting for nonemployee share-based payment transactions to include share-based payment transactions
for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for
fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018. The Company is assessing the impact of this pronouncement to the financial statements.

differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences

it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

the asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences
are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if
 based on the weight of available evidence
it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Warrants are often included in a new debt issue to entice investors by a higher return potential. The main difference between warrants and call options is that warrants are issued and guaranteed by the company
 whereas options are exchange instruments and are not issued by the company. Also
 the lifetime of a warrant is often measured in years
 while the lifetime of a typical option is measured in months. Disclose the title of issue of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the aggregate amount of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the date from which the warrants or rights are exercisable
 and the price at which the warrant or right is exercisable.
