 and that we would restate such financial statements to make the necessary accounting corrections. We discussed this conclusion with our independent registered public accounting firm

As described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) on May 6
 2019
 management noted certain misstatements contained in the Financial Statements relating principally to the accounting treatment for supplier contracts and related arrangements. As previously disclosed
related to our procurement area
 specifically the accounting policies
 procedures
 and internal controls related to our procurement function
 including
 but not limited to
 agreements
 side agreements
 and changes or modifications to agreements with our suppliers. Following the receipt of this subpoena
 we
 together with external counsel and forensic accountants
 and subsequently
 under the oversight of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (the &#8220;Audit Committee&#8221;)
 conducted an internal investigation into the procurement area and related matters. As a result of the findings from this internal investigation
 which is now complete and which identified that multiple employees in the procurement area engaged in misconduct
In connection with the internal investigation
 we also conducted a comprehensive review of supplier contracts and related arrangements to identify other potential misstatements in the timing of the recognition of supplier rebates
 incentive payments
 and pricing arrangements. The review identified further misstatements
 which we also investigated and have been unable to conclude if they resulted from the misconduct described above. 
&#32;relating to the periods up through September 29
&#32;for fiscal year 2018
&#32;for fiscal year 2017
&#32;for fiscal year 2016
We do not believe that the misstatements are quantitatively material to any period presented in our prior financial statements. However
 due to the qualitative nature of the matters identified in our internal investigation
 including the number of years over which the misconduct occurred and the number of transactions
 suppliers
 and procurement employees involved
&#32;Accordingly
In addition
 the statements of income for fiscal years 2017 and 2016
 as previously reported
This Annual Report on Form 10-K restates amounts included in the 2017 Annual Report described above
 including the audited consolidated financial statements at December 30
 2017 and for the fiscal years ended December 30
 2017 and December 31
In addition to the misstatements related to the supplier contracts and related arrangements
 including the misstatements related to lease classification
 we corrected additional identified out-of-period and uncorrected misstatements that were not material
 individually or in the aggregate
These misstatements were related to customer incentive program expense misclassifications
 balance sheet misclassifications
 income taxes
 impairments
 and other misstatements

section within Item 7
 
In connection with the restatement
 management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this assessment
 management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting resulting in the conclusion by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 29
 2018. Management has taken and is taking additional steps to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. See Item 9A
 
We announced on February 21
 2019 that as part of our normal quarterly reporting procedures and planning processes for the fourth quarter of 2018
 the fair values of certain goodwill and intangible assets were below their carrying amounts. As a result
 we announced non-cash impairment losses of $15.4 billion to lower the carrying amount of goodwill in certain reporting units
 primarily U.S. Refrigerated and Canada Retail
 and certain intangible assets
 primarily the Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands. As disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 6
 2019
 we subsequently identified errors in the calculations performed in connection with the interim goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2018. Specifically
 we identified certain errors in projected net cash flows and allocations to certain brands. Correcting this allocation error resulted in an increase to the impairment losses initially calculated for brands of approximately $278 million
In addition
 the corrections to the carrying values on our balance sheet at December 29
 2018 recorded as part of the correction of the procurement-related misstatements described above resulted in an adjustment to the carrying amounts of certain reporting units
 and therefore resulted in a reduction to goodwill impairment losses of approximately $92 million. The net impact of these misstatements was an increase of approximately $15 million from the $15.4 billion total impairment losses in the fourth quarter of 2018 previously announced in our earnings release and investor call on February 21
As discussed in Item 9A
 
 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 we did not design and maintain effective controls to reassess the level of precision used to review the allocation of cash flow projections to certain brands used as a basis for performing our fourth quarter 2018 interim impairment assessments in response to the significant reduction in
 and in certain instances elimination of
 the excess fair value over carrying amount for certain brands that resulted from the changing business environment. This material weakness resulted in the errors in the calculations performed in connection with the interim goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2018
 as described above
 because approximately five to ten percent of cash flows were not subjected to our control procedures. This material weakness arose during our interim impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to the significant reduction in excess fair value over carrying amount for certain brands as noted above

We manufacture (and contract for the manufacture of) our products from a wide variety of raw materials. We purchase and use large quantities of commodities
 including dairy products
 meat products
 coffee beans
 nuts
 tomatoes
 potatoes
 soybean and vegetable oils
 sugar and other sweeteners
 corn products
 and wheat products
 to manufacture our products. In addition
 we purchase and use significant quantities of resins
 metals
 and cardboard to package our products and natural gas to operate our facilities. For commodities that we use across many of our product categories
 such as corrugated paper and energy
 we coordinate sourcing requirements and centralize procurement to leverage our scale. In addition
 some of our product lines and brands separately source raw materials that are specific to their operations. We source these commodities from a variety of providers
 including large
 international producers and smaller
 local
 independent sellers. Where appropriate
 we seek to establish preferred purchaser status and have developed strategic partnerships with many of our suppliers with the objective of achieving favorable pricing and dependable supply for many of our commodities. The prices of raw materials and agricultural materials that we use in our products are affected by external factors
 such as global competition for resources
 currency fluctuations
 severe weather or global climate change
 consumer
 industrial or investment demand
 and changes in governmental regulation and trade
 tariffs
 alternative energy
Our procurement teams monitor worldwide supply and cost trends so we can obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production at competitive prices. Although the prices of our principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate
 we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they are generally available from numerous sources. We use a range of hedging techniques in an effort to limit the impact of price fluctuations on many of our principal raw materials. However
 we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices
Although crops constituting certain of our raw food ingredients are harvested on a seasonal basis
Seasonal factors inherent in our business change the demand for products
 including holidays
 changes in seasons
 or other annual events. While these factors influence our quarterly net sales

 we had accrued an amount we deemed appropriate for environmental remediation. Based on information currently available
 we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or financial condition. However
 it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remedial actions and thus

The food and beverage industry is highly competitive across all of our product offerings. Our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers
 as well as retailers with their own branded and private label products. We compete based on product innovation
 price
 product quality
 nutritional value
 service
 taste
 convenience
 brand recognition and loyalty
 effectiveness of marketing and distribution
 promotional activity
We may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures
 including pressures in relation to private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. These pressures have restricted and may in the future continue to restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases. Failure to effectively assess
 timely change and set proper pricing
 promotions
The rapid emergence of new distribution channels
 particularly e-commerce
 may create consumer price deflation
 affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases. We may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing
 retail trade incentives
 materials
 advertising
 and new product or channel innovation to maintain or increase market share. These expenditures are subject to risks
 including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts. If we are unable to compete effectively
 our profitability
 financial condition
Our success depends on our ability to correctly predict
 identify
 and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand
 to offer new products to meet those changes
Consumer preferences for food and beverage products change continually and rapidly. Our success depends on our ability to predict
 identify
 and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences
 including with respect to health and wellness. If we do not offer products that appeal to consumers
 our sales and market share will decrease
 which could materially and adversely affect our product sales
 financial condition
We must distinguish between short-term trends and long-term changes in consumer preferences. If we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be long-term
 or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences
 our sales could decline. In addition
 because of our varied consumer base
 we must offer an array of products that satisfy a broad spectrum of consumer preferences. If we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories
 or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster-growing or more profitable categories
 demand for our products could decrease
 which could materially and adversely affect our product sales
 financial condition
Prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food and beverage products (including as they relate to obesity or other health concerns) could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs. We strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations
 but we may not be successful in our efforts. Continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales
 financial condition
In addition
 achieving growth depends on our successful development
 introduction
 and marketing of innovative new products and line extensions. There are inherent risks associated with new product or packaging introductions
 including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance or potential impacts on our existing product offerings. We may be required to increase expenditures for new product development. Successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance
 to obtain
 protect
 and maintain necessary intellectual property rights
 and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. We must also be able to respond successfully to technological advances by and intellectual property rights of our competitors
 and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our product sales
 financial condition
Retail customers
 such as supermarkets
 warehouse clubs
 and food distributors in our major markets
 may continue to consolidate
 resulting in fewer but larger customers for our business across various channels. Consolidation also produces larger retail customers that may seek to leverage their positions to improve their profitability by demanding improved efficiency
 lower pricing
 more favorable terms
 increased promotional programs
 or specifically-tailored product offerings. In addition
 larger retailers have scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own private label products. Retail consolidation and increasing retailer power could materially and adversely affect our product sales
 financial condition
Retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers&#8217; business operations or financial performance may have a corresponding material and adverse effect on us. For example
 if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing
 then they may delay
 decrease
 or cancel purchases of our products
 or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases
 which could materially and adversely affect our product sales
 financial condition
In addition
 technology-based systems
 which give consumers the ability to shop through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications
 are also significantly altering the retail landscape in many of our markets. If we are unable to adjust to developments in these changing landscapes
 we may be disadvantaged in key channels and with certain consumers
 which could materially and adversely affect our product sales
 financial condition
Changes in our relationships with significant customers
 suppliers
&#32;within Item 1
). There can be no assurance that all of our significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past
 particularly as increasingly powerful retailers may demand lower pricing and focus on developing their own brands. The loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales or a change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales
 financial condition
Disputes with significant suppliers
 including disputes related to pricing or performance
 could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales
 financial condition
 and operating results. In addition
 terminations of relationships with other significant contractual counterparties
 including licensors
 could adversely affect our portfolio
 product sales
 financial condition
In addition
 the financial condition of such customers
 suppliers
 and other significant contractual counterparties are affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our control. Significant deteriorations in the financial conditions of significant customers
 suppliers
 and other business relationships could materially and adversely affect our product sales
 financial condition
Maintaining
 extending
We have many iconic brands with long-standing consumer recognition across the globe. Our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products
 extend our brands to new platforms
We seek to maintain
 extend
 and expand our brand image through marketing investments
 including advertising and consumer promotions
 and product innovation. Negative perceptions on the role of food and beverage marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and scrutiny of marketing practices. Moreover
 adverse publicity about legal or regulatory action against us
 our quality and safety
 our environmental or social impacts
 our products becoming unavailable to consumers
 or our suppliers and
 in some cases
 our competitors
 could damage our reputation and brand image
 undermine our customers&#8217; confidence
 and reduce demand for our products
 even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. Furthermore
 existing or increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising
 consumer promotions
 and marketing
 or our response to those restrictions
 could limit our efforts to maintain
 extend
In addition
 our success in maintaining
 extending
 and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment. We increasingly rely on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. The growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information
 including misinformation
 and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us
 our brands or our products
 or our suppliers and
 in some cases
 our competitors
 on social or digital media
 whether or not valid
 could seriously damage our brands and reputation. In addition
 we might fail to appropriately target our marketing efforts
 anticipate consumer preferences
 or invest sufficiently in maintaining
 extending
 and expanding our brand image. If we do not maintain
 extend
 and expand our reputation or brand image
 then our product sales
 financial condition
In nearly all of our product categories
 we compete with branded products as well as private label products
 which are typically sold at lower prices. Our products must provide higher value and/or quality to our consumers than alternatives
 particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. Consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value and/or quality between our products and private label products change in favor of competitors&#8217; products or if consumers perceive this type of change. If consumers prefer private label products
 then we could lose market share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings. A change in consumer preferences could also cause us to increase capital
 marketing
 and other expenditures
 which could materially and adversely affect our product sales
 financial condition
We may be unable to drive revenue growth in our key product categories
 increase our market share
Our future results will depend on our ability to drive revenue growth in our key product categories and growth in the food and beverage industry in the countries in which we operate. Our future results will also depend on our ability to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster-growing and more profitable categories and our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories. Our failure to drive revenue growth
 limit market share decreases in our key product categories
 or develop innovative products for new and existing categories could materially and adversely affect our product sales
 financial condition
Selling products for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks
 including product contamination
 spoilage
 product tampering
 allergens
 or other adulteration. We have decided and could in the future decide to
 and have been or could in the future be required to
 recall products due to suspected or confirmed product contamination
 adulteration
 product mislabeling or misbranding
 tampering
 undeclared allergens
 or other deficiencies. Product recalls or market withdrawals could result in significant losses due to their costs
 the destruction of product inventory
We could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients
 or the food safety system generally. Adverse attention about these types of concerns
 whether or not valid
 may damage our reputation
 discourage consumers from buying our products
We may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations
 or if our products cause injury
 illness
 or death. In addition
 our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism. A significant product liability or other legal judgment or a related regulatory enforcement action against us
 or a significant product recall
 may materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability. Moreover
 even if a product liability or fraud claim is unsuccessful
 has no merit
 or is not pursued
 the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our product sales
 financial condition
We have a complex network of suppliers
 owned and leased manufacturing locations
 co-manufacturing locations
 distribution networks
 and information systems that support our ability to consistently provide our products to our customers. Factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control
 such as weather
 raw material shortages
 natural disasters
 fires or explosions
 political unrest
 terrorism
 generalized labor unrest
 or health pandemics
 could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers&#8217;
 co-manufacturers&#8217; or distributors&#8217; operations. These disruptions may require additional resources to restore our supply chain or distribution network. If we cannot respond to disruptions in our operations
 whether by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations
 or if we are unable to quickly repair damage to our information
 production
 or supply systems
 we may be late in delivering
 or be unable to deliver
 products to our customers and may also be unable to track orders
 inventory
 receivables
 and payables. If that occurs
 our customers&#8217; confidence in us and long-term demand for our products could decline. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales
 financial condition
We may not successfully identify
 complete
 or realize the benefits from strategic acquisitions
 alliances
 divestitures
 joint ventures
From time to time
 we have evaluated and may continue to evaluate acquisition candidates
 alliances
 joint ventures
 or other investments that may strategically fit our business objectives
 and we have divested and may consider divesting businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or growth or profitability targets. These activities may present financial
 managerial
 and operational risks including
 but not limited to
 diversion of management&#8217;s attention from existing core businesses
 difficulties integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems
 inability to effectively and immediately implement control environment processes across a diverse employee population
 adverse effects on existing or acquired customer and supplier business relationships
 and potential disputes with buyers
 sellers
 or partners. Activities in such areas are regulated by numerous antitrust and competition laws in the United States
 Canada
 the European Union
 and other jurisdictions
 and we may be required to obtain the approval of these transactions by competition authorities
To the extent we undertake acquisitions
 alliances
 joint ventures
 investments
 or other developments outside our core regions or in new categories
 we may face additional risks related to such developments. For example
 risks related to foreign operations include compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States
 such as the FCPA
 currency rate fluctuations
 compliance with foreign regulations and laws
 including tax laws
 and exposure to politically and economically volatile developing markets. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our product sales
 financial condition
We may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from prior or future streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs
 simplify or improve processes
We have implemented a number of cost savings initiatives
 including our Integration Program (as defined in 
 in Item 7
)
 that we believe are important to position our business for future success and growth. We have evaluated and continue to evaluate changes to our organizational structure to enable us to reduce costs
 simplify or improve processes
 and improve our competitiveness. Our future success may depend upon our ability to realize the benefits of these or other cost savings initiatives. In addition
 certain of our initiatives may lead to increased costs in other aspects of our business such as increased conversion
 outsourcing
 or distribution costs. We must accurately predict costs and be efficient in executing any plans to achieve cost savings and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food and beverage industry
 particularly in an environment of increased competitive activity. To capitalize on our efforts
 we must carefully evaluate investments in our business
 and execute in those areas with the most potential return on investment. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from any cost-saving efforts
 we could be cost disadvantaged in the marketplace
 and our competitiveness
 production
 profitability
 financial conditions
We plan to continue to conduct strategic initiatives in various markets. Consumer demands
 behaviors
 tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these markets and
 as a result
 our sales may not be successful or meet expectations
 or the margins on those sales may be less than currently anticipated. We may also face difficulties integrating new business operations with our current sourcing
 distribution
 information technology systems
 and other operations. Any of these challenges could hinder our success in new markets or new distribution channels. We may also face difficulties divesting business operations with minimal impact to the retained businesses. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete any planned strategic initiatives
 that any new business will be profitable or meet our expectations
 or that any divestiture will be completed without disruption
&#32;of our 2018 net sales were generated outside of the United States. As a result
 we are subject to risks inherent in global operations. These risks
 which can vary substantially by market
compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States
changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates
 changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities
 changes in tax laws or their interpretations
the imposition of increased or new tariffs
 quotas
 trade barriers
 or similar restrictions on our sales or imports
 trade agreements
 regulations
 taxes
compliance with antitrust and competition laws
 data privacy laws
 and a variety of other local
 national
changes in capital controls
 including currency exchange controls
 government currency policies
changes in local regulations and laws
 the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions
risks and costs associated with political and economic instability
 corruption
 anti-American sentiment
the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation
 application
design
 implementation
In addition
 political and economic changes or volatility
 geopolitical conflicts
 terrorist activity
 political unrest
 civil strife
 acts of war
 public corruption
 expropriation
 and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand. Slow economic growth or high unemployment in the markets in which we operate could constrain consumer spending
 and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability. All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased sales
 and could materially and adversely affect our product sales
 financial condition
Our performance has been in the past and may continue in the future to be impacted by economic and political conditions in the United States and in other nations where we do business. Economic and financial uncertainties in our international markets
 including uncertainties surrounding the legal and regulatory effects of Brexit
 changes to major international trade arrangements (e.g.
 the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement)
 and the imposition of tariffs by certain foreign governments
 including China and Canada
 in response to the imposition of tariffs or modification of trade relationships by the United States
 could negatively impact our operations and sales. Other factors impacting our operations in the United States and in international locations where we do business include export and import restrictions
 currency exchange rates
 currency devaluation
 cash repatriation restrictions
 recessionary conditions
 foreign ownership restrictions
 nationalization
 the impact of hyperinflationary environments
 terrorist acts
 and political unrest. Such factors in either domestic or foreign jurisdictions
 and our responses to them
 could materially and adversely affect our product sales
 financial condition
 and operating results. For further information on Venezuela

in Item 8
We depend on the skills
 working relationships
 and continued services of key personnel
 including our experienced management team. In addition
 our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify
 hire
 train
 and retain qualified individuals. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel
 and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract
 train
 and retain other talented personnel and a diverse global workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business.&#160;Unplanned turnover
 failure to attract and develop personnel with key emerging capabilities such as&#160;e-commerce&#160;and digital marketing skills
 or failure to develop adequate succession plans for leadership positions
 including the Chief Executive Officer position
 could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness. Changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate skilled employees. Any such loss
 failure
 or limitation could adversely affect our product sales
 financial condition
We are significantly dependent on information technology
 and we may be unable to protect our information systems against service interruption
 misappropriation of data
We rely on information technology networks and systems
 including the Internet
 to process
 transmit
 and store electronic and financial information
 to manage a variety of business processes and activities
 and to comply with regulatory
 legal
 and tax requirements. We also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations
 personnel
 customers
 and suppliers. These information technology systems
 some of which are managed by third parties
 may be susceptible to damage
 invasions
 disruptions
 or shutdowns due to hardware failures
 computer viruses
 hacker attacks and other cybersecurity risks
 telecommunication failures
 user errors
 catastrophic events or other factors. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage
 disruption
 or shutdown
 by unintentional or malicious actions of employees and contractors or by cyber-attacks
 and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner
 we could experience business disruptions
 reputational damage
 transaction errors
 processing inefficiencies
 the leakage of confidential information
 and the loss of customers and sales
 causing our product sales
 financial condition
In addition
 if we are unable to prevent security breaches or disclosure of non-public information
 we may suffer financial and reputational damage
 litigation or remediation costs
 fines
 or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners
 customers
 consumers
Misuse
 leakage
 or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations
 damage to our reputation and credibility
 loss of opportunities to acquire or divest of businesses or brands
 and loss of ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts and
 therefore
 could have a negative impact on net sales. In addition
 we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us
 our current or former employees
 or to our suppliers or consumers
Our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers
 suppliers
 distributors
We have been and may in the future be impacted by severe weather and other geological events
 including hurricanes
 earthquakes
 floods
 or tsunamis that could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers
 suppliers
 distributors
 or regulators. Natural disasters or other disruptions at any of our facilities or our suppliers&#8217; or distributors&#8217; facilities may impair or delay the delivery of our products. Influenza or other pandemics could disrupt production of our products
 reduce demand for certain of our products
 or disrupt the marketplace in the foodservice or retail environment with consequent material adverse effects on our results of operations. While we insure against many of these events and certain business interruption risks and have policies and procedures to manage business continuity planning
 we cannot provide any assurance that such insurance will compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters or that our business continuity plans will effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner. To the extent we are unable to
 or cannot
 financially mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events
 or effectively manage such events if they occur
 particularly when a product is sourced from a single location
 there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations
As of December 29
 2018
 the Sponsors own approximately 49% of our common stock. Four of our current 11 directors had been directors of Heinz prior to the closing of the 2015 Merger and remained directors of Kraft Heinz pursuant to the merger agreement. In addition
 the Board elected Joao M. Castro-Neves
 a partner of 3G Capital
 one of the Sponsors
 effective June 12
 2019. Furthermore
 some of our executive officers
 including Bernardo Hees
 our Chief Executive Officer
 are partners of 3G Capital. As a result
 the Sponsors have the potential to exercise influence over management and have substantial control over decisions of our Board of Directors as well as over any action requiring the approval of the holders of our common stock
 including adopting any amendments to our charter
 electing directors
 and approving mergers or sales of substantially all of our capital stock or our assets. In addition
 to the extent that the Sponsors were to collectively hold a majority of our common stock
 they together would have the power to take shareholder action by written consent to adopt amendments to our charter or take other actions
 such as corporate transactions
 that require the vote of holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock. The directors designated by the Sponsors may have significant authority to effect decisions affecting our capital structure
 including the issuance of additional capital stock
 the incurrence of additional indebtedness
 the implementation of stock repurchase programs
 and the decision of whether to declare dividends and the amount of any such dividends. Additionally
 the Sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. The Sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business
 and
 as a result
 those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as the Sponsors continue to own a significant amount of our equity
Our level of indebtedness
 as well as our failure to comply with covenants under our debt instruments
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness
 and are permitted to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness
 including secured debt. Our existing debt
 together with any incurrence of additional indebtedness
 could have important consequences
 including
limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital
 capital expenditures
 research and development
 debt service requirements
 acquisitions
resulting in a downgrade to our credit rating
 which could adversely affect our cost of funds
requiring a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness
 thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations
 payments of dividends
 capital expenditures
exposing us to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency
in the case of any additional indebtedness
In addition
 there can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs. As a result
 we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. There is no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms
Our indebtedness instruments contain customary representations
 warranties and covenants
 including a financial covenant in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the &#8220;Senior Credit Facility&#8221;) to maintain a minimum shareholders&#8217; equity (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses)). The creditors who hold our debt could accelerate amounts due in the event that we default
 which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity of our other debt. If our operating performance declines
 or if we are unable to comply with any covenant
 such as our ability to timely prepare and file our periodic reports with the SEC
During the period from December 29
 2018 to the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 due to the delays in the preparation of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 29
 2018 and the fiscal quarter ended March 30
 2019
 we were not in compliance with certain reporting covenants under the Senior Credit Facility. As previously disclosed
 we entered into two waiver agreements with respect to the Senior Credit Facility
 pursuant to which the lenders
 as party to the Senior Credit Facility
 and JPMorgan Chase Bank
 N.A.
 as administrative agent
 granted temporary waivers of compliance by us with respect to the requirement to furnish the lenders a copy of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December&#160;29
 2018 no later than June 28
 2019 and for our fiscal quarter ended March 30
 2019 no later than July 31
 2019. The filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K will constitute compliance with the requirement to furnish the lenders a copy of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29
 2018 no later than June 28
 2019. We also currently expect to file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 30
 2019 on or before July 31
 2019 in compliance with the requirement to furnish the lenders a copy of the consolidated financial statements for such&#160;quarter no later than July 31
 2019. For further information related to the two waiver agreements
&#32;in Item 7
However
 we may not be able to secure similar waivers for any future delays in our periodic reports with the SEC. Furthermore
 if we breach any covenants under our indebtedness instruments and seek a waiver
 we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required creditors
 or we may not be able to remedy compliance within the terms of any waivers approved by the required creditors. If this occurs
 we would be in default under our indebtedness instruments and unable to access our Senior Credit Facility. In addition
 certain creditors could exercise their rights
 as described above
&#32;reporting units
We test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter
 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount. Such events and circumstances could include a sustained decrease in our market capitalization
 increased competition or unexpected loss of market share
 increased input costs beyond projections (for example due to regulatory or industry changes)
 disposals of significant brands or components of our business
 unexpected business disruptions (for example due to a natural disaster or loss of a customer
 supplier
 or other significant business relationship)
 unexpected significant declines in operating results
 or significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate. We test reporting units for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. We test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value
 we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount
 in the case of reporting units
As detailed in Note 10
 
 in Item 8
 
 as a result of our 2018 annual impairment test in the second quarter of 2018
. Additionally
 as part of our interim impairment test in the third quarter of 2018
For the fourth quarter of 2018
 in connection with the preparation of our year-end financial statements
 we assessed the changes in circumstances that occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair values of any reporting units or brands were below their carrying amounts. Although our annual impairment test is performed during the second quarter
While there was no single determinative event or factor
These factors included: (i) a sustained decrease in our share price in November and December of 2018
 which reduced our market capitalization below the book value of net assets; (ii) the completion of our fourth quarter results
 which were below management&#8217;s expectations due to several factors such as higher than expected supply chain costs and increased competition; (iii) the development and approval of our 2019 annual operating plan in December 2018
 which provided additional insights into expectations and priorities for the coming years
 such as lower growth and margin expectations; (iv) the announcement in November 2018 to sell certain assets in our natural cheese portfolio in Canada
 which changed the composition and use of the remaining assets and brands in the associated reporting unit; (v) fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in certain countries; (vi) increased interest rates in certain locations
Accordingly
 we performed an interim impairment test on these reporting units and brands as of December 29
 2018. As a result of our interim impairment test
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions
 estimates
requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans
 as well as industry
 economic
&#32;estimated future annual net cash flows
 income tax considerations
 discount rates
 growth rates
 royalty rates
 contributory asset charges
 and other market factors. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met
 if market factors outside of our control
 such as discount rates
 change
 or if management&#8217;s expectations or plans otherwise change
 including as a result of the development of our global five-year operating plan
&#32;As detailed in Note 10
 
 in Item 8
 
&#32;for the year ended December 29
that were impaired in 2018 were written down to their respective fair values resulting in zero excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2018 impairment testing dates. Accordingly
&#32;or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest testing date have a heightened risk of future impairments if any assumptions
 estimates
&#32;at December 29
 2018 and included: U.S. Grocery
 U.S. Refrigerated
 Canada Retail
 Latin America Exports
 Southeast Europe
 Australia and New Zealand
&#32;with a heightened risk of future impairments
&#32;at December 29
 2018 and included: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
&#32;with a heightened risk of future impairments
&#32;excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2018 impairment testing date
 these amounts are also associated with the 2013 Heinz acquisition and the 2015 Merger and are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values. Therefore
 if any assumptions
 estimates
 or market factors change in the future
 these amounts are also susceptible to impairments
We derive a substantial portion of our net sales from international operations. We hold assets and incur liabilities
 earn revenue
 and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar
 primarily the British pound sterling
 euro
 Australian dollar
 Canadian dollar
 New Zealand dollar
 Brazilian real
 Indonesian rupiah
 Chinese renminbi
 and Indian rupee. Since our consolidated financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars
 fluctuations in exchange rates from period to period will have an impact on our reported results. We have implemented currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. However
 these hedging strategies may not be successful
 and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be subject to market fluctuations. In addition
 in certain circumstances
 we may incur costs in one currency related to services or products for which we are paid in a different currency. As a result
 factors associated with international operations
 including changes in foreign currency exchange rates
Commodity
 energy
We purchase and use large quantities of commodities
 including dairy products
 meat products
 coffee beans
 nuts
 tomatoes
 potatoes
 soybean and vegetable oils
 sugar and other sweeteners
 corn products
 wheat products
 cucumbers
 onions
 other fruits and vegetables
 spices
 and flour to manufacture our products. In addition
 we purchase and use significant quantities of resins
 metals
 cardboard
 glass
 plastic
 paper
 fiberboard
 and other materials to package our products
 and we use other inputs
 such as natural gas and water
 to operate our facilities. We are also exposed to changes in oil prices
 which influence both our packaging and transportation costs. Prices for commodities
 energy
 and other supplies are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict
 including global competition for resources
 currency fluctuations
 severe weather or global climate change
 crop failures
 or shortages due to plant disease or insect and other pest infestation
 consumer
 industrial
 or investment demand
 and changes in governmental regulation and trade
 tariffs
 alternative energy
 including increased demand for biofuels
 and agricultural programs. Additionally
 we may be unable to maintain favorable arrangements with respect to the costs of procuring raw materials
 packaging
 services
 and transporting products
 which could result in increased expenses and negatively affect our operations. Furthermore
 the cost of raw materials and finished products may fluctuate due to movements in cross-currency transaction rates. Rising commodity
 energy
 and other input costs could materially and adversely affect our cost of operations
 including the manufacture
 transportation
 and distribution of our products
Although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program
 and seek to hedge against input price increases to the extent we deem appropriate
 we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices
 and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw materials costs. For example
 hedging our costs for one of our key commodities
 dairy products
 is difficult because dairy futures markets are not as developed as many other commodities futures markets. Continued volatility or sustained increases in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products
 and our profitability could suffer. Moreover
 increases in the prices of our products to cover these increased costs may result in lower sales volumes
 or we may be constrained from increasing the prices of our products by competitive and consumer pressures. If we are not successful in our hedging activities
 or if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs
We use commodity futures
 options
 and swaps to economically hedge the price of certain input costs
 including dairy products
 meat products
 coffee beans
 sugar
 vegetable oils
 wheat products
 corn products
 cocoa products
 packaging products
 diesel fuel
 and natural gas. We recognize gains and losses based on changes in the values of these commodity derivatives. We recognize these gains and losses in cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of income to the extent we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process. We recognize these gains and losses in general corporate expenses in our segment operating results until we sell the underlying products
 at which time we reclassify the gains and losses to segment operating results. Accordingly
Our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension
 labor
Inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs
 which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition. Our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the United States
 Canada
 and other foreign jurisdictions
 including pension
 health and welfare
 and severance benefits. Any declines in market returns could adversely impact the funding of pension plans
 the assets of which are invested in a diversified portfolio of equity and fixed-income securities and other investments. Additionally
Furthermore
Compliance with laws
 regulations
 and related interpretations and related legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions could impact our business
 and we face additional risks and uncertainties related to any potential actions resulting from the SEC&#8217;s ongoing investigation
 as well as potential additional subpoenas
 litigation
As a large
 global food and beverage company
 we operate in a highly-regulated environment with constantly-evolving legal and regulatory frameworks. Various laws and regulations govern production
 storage
 distribution
 sales
 advertising
 labeling
 including on-pack claims
 information or disclosures
 marketing
 licensing
 trade
 labor
 tax
 environmental matters
 privacy
 as well as health and safety and data protection practices. Government authorities regularly change laws and regulations and their interpretations. In particular
 Brexit could result in a new regulatory regime in the United Kingdom that may or may not follow that of the European Union
 and the creation of new and divergent laws and regulations could increase the cost and complexity of our compliance.&#160;In addition
 this shift in regime could create a number of legal and accounting complexities with respect to existing relationships
 including uncertainty regarding the continuity of contracts entered into by entities in the United Kingdom or the European Union. Our compliance with new or revised laws and regulations
 or the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations
 could materially and adversely affect our product sales
 financial condition
 and results of operations. As a consequence of the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate
As previously disclosed on February 21
 2019
 we received a subpoena in October 2018 from the SEC related to our procurement area
 specifically the accounting policies
 procedures
 and internal controls related to our procurement function
 including
 but not limited to
 agreements
 side agreements
 and changes or modifications to agreements with our suppliers. Following the receipt of this subpoena
 we
 together with external counsel and forensic accountants
 and subsequently
 under the oversight of the Audit Committee
 conducted an internal investigation into our procurement area and related matters. Following our earnings release and investor call on February 21
 2019
 when we announced the results of our interim assessment of goodwill and intangible asset impairments
 the SEC requested additional information related to our financial reporting
 internal controls
 and disclosures
 our assessment of goodwill and intangible asset impairments
 and our communications with certain shareholders. It is our understanding that the United States Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Northern District of Illinois also is reviewing this matter
&#32;After our earnings release
 four securities class action lawsuits
 one class action lawsuit under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;)
 and five stockholder derivative actions were filed against us and certain of our current and former officers
 directors
 and employees. One of the securities class action lawsuits was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice
We intend to vigorously defend against these lawsuits. We are unable
 at this time
 to estimate our potential liability in these matters
 but we may be required to pay judgments
 settlements
 or other penalties and incur other costs and expenses in connection with the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits and the stockholder derivative actions. See Item 3
 
 and Note 18
 
 in Item 8
 
Furthermore
 if the SEC commences legal action as a result of the investigation
 we could be required to pay significant penalties and become subject to injunctions
 cease and desist orders
We have incurred
 and may continue to incur
 significant expenses related to legal
 accounting
 and other professional services in connection with the internal investigation
 the SEC investigation
 and related legal and regulatory matters. These expenses
 the delay in timely filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 the delay in timely filing our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 30
 2019
 and the diversion of the attention of the management team that has occurred
 and is expected to continue
 has adversely affected
 and could continue to adversely affect
 our business
 financial condition
As a result of matters associated with the internal investigation related to the SEC investigation and various lawsuits
 we are exposed to greater risks associated with litigation
 regulatory proceedings
 and government enforcement actions and additional subpoenas. Any future investigations or additional lawsuits may have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition
 results of operations
We identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to remediate these material weaknesses
 or if we experience additional material weaknesses or other deficiencies in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls
 we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results
 in which case our business may be harmed
 investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for evaluating and reporting on the effectiveness of our system of internal control. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;). As a public company
 we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other rules that govern public companies. In particular
 we are required to certify our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 which requires us to furnish annually a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition
In connection with our most recent year-end assessment of internal control over financial reporting
 we determined that
 as of December 29
 2018
 we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting because of a material weakness in our risk assessment process related to designing and maintaining controls sufficient to appropriately respond to changes in our business environment. This material weakness in risk assessment also contributed to material weaknesses arising from (i) supplier contracts and related arrangements
 and (ii) goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing
 and we have taken and are taking certain remedial steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting. For further discussion of the material weaknesses identified and our remedial efforts
 see Item 9A
Remediation efforts place a significant burden on management and add increased pressure to our financial resources and processes. As a result
 we may not be successful in making the improvements necessary to remediate the material weaknesses identified by management
 be able to do so in a timely manner
 or be able to identify and remediate additional control deficiencies
 including material weaknesses
If we are unable to successfully remediate our existing or any future material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting
 the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected; our liquidity
 our access to capital markets
 the perceptions of our creditworthiness
 and our ability to complete acquisitions may be adversely affected; we may be unable to maintain or regain compliance with applicable securities laws
 The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (&#8220;Nasdaq&#8221;) listing requirements
 and the covenants under our debt instruments or derivative arrangements regarding the timely filing of periodic reports; we may be subject to regulatory investigations and penalties; investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting; we may suffer defaults
 accelerations
Our failure to prepare and timely file our periodic reports with the SEC limits our access to the public markets to raise debt or equity capital
 restricts our ability to issue equity securities
 including within the Kraft Heinz Savings Plan and the Kraft Heinz Union Savings Plan (collectively
 the &#8220;Plan&#8221;)
We did not file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29
 2018 or our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 30
 2019 within each respective timeframe required by the SEC
 meaning we have not remained current in our reporting requirements with the SEC. This limits our ability to access the public markets to raise debt or equity capital
 which could prevent us from pursuing transactions or implementing business strategies that we might otherwise believe are beneficial to our business. We are not currently eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 that would allow us to continuously incorporate by reference our SEC reports into the registration statement
 or to use &#8220;shelf&#8221; registration statements to conduct offerings
 until approximately one year from the date we regain and maintain status as a current filer. If we wish to pursue a public offering now
 we would be required to file a registration statement on Form S-1 and have it reviewed and declared effective by the SEC. Doing so would likely take significantly longer than using a registration statement on Form S-3 and increase our transaction costs
 and the necessity of using a Form S-1 for a public offering of registered securities could
 to the extent we are not able to conduct offerings using alternative methods
In addition
 as a result of the failure to remain current in our reporting requirements with the SEC
 we are not currently eligible to use Form S-8 registration statements. As a result
 on April 23
 2019
 the administrator of the Plan issued a notice to Plan participants advising participants of a blackout period during which participants are prohibited from acquiring beneficial ownership of additional interests in The Kraft Heinz Company Stock Fund. If we are not able to become and remain current in our reporting requirements with the SEC
As previously disclosed
 we also received notices from Nasdaq regarding our noncompliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1)
 which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC. We timely submitted our plan to regain compliance
 and Nasdaq granted the Company until September 11
 2019 to regain compliance
 subject to our compliance with certain terms outlined in the notice received on May 15
 2019
 including filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29
 2018 and filing our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 30
 2019
 which we expect to file as promptly as practicable following the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we are not able to file before September 11
 2019
 however
We reached a determination to restate certain of our previously issued consolidated financial statements
As discussed in the Explanatory Note
 in Note 2
 
 and in Note 23
 
 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 we reached a determination to restate our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for the years ended December 30
 2017 and December 31
 2016 and to restate each of the quarterly and year-to-date periods for the nine months ended September 29
 2018 and for fiscal year 2017
We do not believe that the misstatements are quantitatively material to any period presented in our prior financial statements. However
 due to the qualitative nature of the matters identified in our internal investigation
 including the number of years over which the misconduct occurred and the number of transactions
 suppliers
 and procurement employees involved
&#32;As a result
 we have incurred unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement
 and have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties
Our intellectual property rights are valuable
We consider our intellectual property rights
 particularly and most notably our trademarks
 but also our patents
 trade secrets
 trade dress
 copyrights
 and licensing agreements
 to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent
 trademark
 copyright
 trade secret
 and trade dress laws
 as well as licensing agreements
 third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements
 and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to develop or adequately protect our trademarks
 products
 new features of our products
 or our technology
 or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property
 may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business and financial condition. We also license certain intellectual property
 most notably trademarks
 from third parties. To the extent that we are not able to contract with these third parties on favorable terms or maintain our relationships with these third parties
We may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology
 brands
We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and foreign tax liabilities are dependent on the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed. Additionally
 the amount of taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. A number of factors influence our effective tax rate
 including changes in tax laws and treaties as well as the interpretation of existing laws and rules. Federal
 state
 and local governments and administrative bodies within the United States
 which represents the majority of our operations
 and other foreign jurisdictions have implemented
 or are considering
 a variety of broad tax
 trade
 and other regulatory reforms that may impact us. For example
 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &#8220;U.S. Tax Reform&#8221;) enacted on December 22
 2017 resulted in changes in our corporate tax rate
 our deferred income taxes
 and the taxation of foreign earnings. The comprehensive impact of U.S. Tax Reform is yet to be determined
 and future guidance and interpretations may have adverse or uncertain effects. Relatedly
 changes in tax laws resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development&#8217;s (&#8220;OECD&#8221;) multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit sharing (&#8220;BEPS&#8221;) could impact our effective tax rate. It is not currently possible to accurately determine the potential comprehensive impact of these or future changes
Significant judgment
 knowledge
 and experience are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Our future effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors including changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities
 changes in geographic mix of income
 increases in expenses not deductible for tax
 including impairment of goodwill
 and changes in available tax credits. In the ordinary course of our business
 there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are also regularly subject to audits by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable
Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market
 sales of our common stock by the Sponsors
 or the perception that these sales might occur
 could depress the market price of our common stock
 and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. A sustained depression in the market price of our common stock has happened (in November and December 2018
 which was a contributing factor to our decision to perform an interim impairment test for certain reporting units and brands in the fourth quarter of 2018
 for which we ultimately recorded impairment losses) and could in the future happen
 which could also reduce our market capitalization below the book value of net assets
Kraft Heinz
 3G Capital
 and Berkshire Hathaway entered into a registration rights agreement requiring us to register for resale under the Securities Act all registrable shares held by 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway
 which represents all shares of our common stock held by the Sponsors as of the date of the closing of the 2015 Merger. As of December 29
 2018
 registrable shares represented approximately 49% of all outstanding shares of our common stock. Although the registrable shares are subject to certain holdback and suspension periods
 the registrable shares are not subject to a &#8220;lock-up&#8221; or similar restriction under the registration rights agreement. Accordingly
Our ability to pay regular dividends to our shareholders and the amounts of any such dividends are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and may be limited by our financial condition
 debt agreements
Although it is currently anticipated that we will continue to pay regular quarterly dividends
 any such determination to pay dividends and the amounts thereof will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be dependent on then-existing conditions
 including our financial condition
 income
 legal requirements
 including limitations under Delaware law
 debt agreements
 and other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Board of Directors has decided
 and may in the future decide
 in its sole discretion
 to change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. For these reasons
 shareholders will not be able to rely on dividends to receive a return on investment. Accordingly
 realization of any gain on shares of our common stock may depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock
Changes in financial and capital markets
 including market disruptions
 limited liquidity
 uncertainty regarding Brexit
 and interest rate volatility
 including as a result of the use or discontinued use of certain benchmark rates such as LIBOR
 may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt. In addition
 our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by rating organizations. A decrease in these ratings could limit our access to capital markets and increase our borrowing costs
Some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged. Consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers
 some of which are highly leveraged and facing increased competition and continued credit market volatility. These factors have caused some customers to be less profitable

As previously disclosed
 we adopted a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition in the first quarter of 2018
 and at the same time
 we retrospectively corrected immaterial misclassifications in our statements of income principally related to customer incentive program expense misclassifications. This resulted in net sales decreases of $147 million in 2017
 $152 million in 2016
The increases in net sales in 2016 and in 2015 compared to the prior year
 and the increases in total assets and long-term debt from December 28
 2014 to January 3
 2016
We have restated previously disclosed consolidated financial data for fiscal years 2017
 2016
 and 2015
 as well as the related balance sheet dates
 to correct misstatements principally related to supplier contracts and related arrangements
 as well as other identified out-of-period and uncorrected misstatements. See Note 2
 
 in Item 8
 
The increases in income/(loss)
 income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders
 and basic and diluted income/(loss) per common share in 2017 compared to 2016 were primarily driven by U.S. Tax Reform
 which was enacted in December 2017. See Note 11

 our Board of Directors approved a change to our fiscal year end from Sunday to Saturday. Effective December 31

 we operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December in each calendar year. In prior years
 we operated on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending the Sunday closest to December 31. As a result
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8

For the fourth quarter of 2018
 in connection with the preparation of our year-end financial statements
 we assessed the changes in circumstances that occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair values of any reporting units or brands were below their carrying amounts. Although our annual impairment test is performed during the second quarter
While there was no single determinative event or factor
These factors included: (i) a sustained decrease in our share price in November and December of 2018
 which reduced our market capitalization below the book value of net assets; (ii) the completion of our fourth quarter results
 which were below management&#8217;s expectations due to several factors such as higher than expected supply chain costs and increased competition; (iii) the development and approval of our 2019 annual operating plan in December 2018
 which provided additional insights into expectations and priorities for the coming years
 such as lower growth and margin expectations; (iv) the announcement in November 2018 to sell certain assets in our natural cheese portfolio in Canada
 which changed the composition and use of the remaining assets and brands in the associated reporting unit; (v) fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in certain countries; (vi) increased interest rates in certain locations
As we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of certain reporting units or brands were below their carrying amounts
 we performed an interim impairment test as of December 29
 2018. As a result of our interim impairment test
within this item and Note 10
 
 in Item 8
 
U.S. Tax Reform legislation enacted by the federal government on December 22
 2017 significantly changed U.S. tax laws by
 among other things
 lowering the federal corporate tax rate from 
 effective January 1
 2018 and imposing a one-time toll charge on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 30
 2017. In addition
 there were many new provisions
 including changes to bonus depreciation
 revised deductions for executive compensation and interest expense
 a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (&#8220;GILTI&#8221;)
 the base erosion anti-abuse tax (&#8220;BEAT&#8221;)
 and a deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (&#8220;FDII&#8221;). While the corporate tax rate reduction was effective January 1
 2018
 we accounted for this anticipated rate change in 2017
&#32;As a result of U.S. Tax Reform
 we recorded a net tax benefit of approximately $7.0 billion in 2017. As a result
 U.S. Tax Reform significantly impacted our provision for/(benefit from) income taxes and our effective tax rate
 primarily in 2017
See Note 11

&#32;in 2017. The remaining $390 million decrease in operating income/(loss) was due to higher input costs and strategic investments. These decreases to operating income/(loss) were partially offset by lower Integration Program and other restructuring expenses
 the favorable impact of foreign currency (4.2 pp)
 the benefit from the postemployment benefits accounting change adopted in the first quarter of 2018
 savings from Integration Program and other restructuring activities
 and productivity savings. See Note 10
 
 in Item 8

 as well as a lower tax benefit
 unfavorable changes in other expense/(income)
 net
 and higher interest expense
The 2018 effective tax rate was lower
 primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. federal statutory rate
 non-deductible items (including goodwill impairments
 nonmonetary currency devaluation losses
 and the wind-up of non-U.S. pension plans)
 the impact of the federal tax on GILTI
 and the revaluation of our deferred tax balances due to changes in state tax laws following U.S. Tax Reform

Management evaluates segment performance based on several factors
 including net sales
 Organic Net Sales
 and segment adjusted earnings before interest
 tax
 depreciation
Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense
 other expense/(income)
 net
 provision for/(benefit from) income taxes
 and depreciation and amortization (excluding integration and restructuring expenses); in addition to these adjustments
 we exclude
 when they occur
 the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses
 deal costs
 unrealized gains/(losses) on commodity hedges (the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized; once realized
 the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment&#8217;s operating results)
 impairment losses
 gains/(losses) on the sale of a business
 other gains/(losses) related to acquisitions and divestitures (e.g.
 tax and hedging impacts)
 nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g.
 remeasurement gains and losses)
Under highly inflationary accounting
 the functional currency of our Venezuelan subsidiary is the U.S. dollar. As a result
 we must revalue the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary to U.S. dollars. We revalue the income statement using daily weighted average Sistema de Divisa Complementaria (&#8220;DICOM&#8221;) rates
 and we revalue the bolivar denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the period-end DICOM spot rate. The resulting revaluation gains and losses are recorded in current net income and are classified within other expense/(income)
 net as nonmonetary currency devaluation. See Note 16

Our indefinite-lived intangible asset balance primarily consists of a number of individual brands
December&#160;29
We test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter
 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount. Such events and circumstances could include a sustained decrease in our market capitalization
 increased competition or unexpected loss of market share
 increased input costs beyond projections (for example due to regulatory or industry changes)
 disposals of significant brands or components of our business
 unexpected business disruptions (for example due to a natural disaster or loss of a customer
 supplier
 or other significant business relationship)
 unexpected significant declines in operating results
 or significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate. We test reporting units for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. We test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value
 we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount
 in the case of reporting units
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions
 estimates
requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans
 as well as industry
 economic
&#32;estimated future annual net cash flows
 income tax considerations
 discount rates
 growth rates
 royalty rates
 contributory asset charges
 and other market factors. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met
 if market factors outside of our control
 such as discount rates
 change
 or if management&#8217;s expectations or plans otherwise change
 including as a result of the development of our global five-year operating plan
&#32;As detailed in Note 10
 
 in Item 8
 
&#32;for the year ended December 29
that were impaired in 2018 were written down to their respective fair values resulting in zero excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2018 impairment testing dates. Accordingly
&#32;or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest testing date have a heightened risk of future impairments if any assumptions
 estimates
&#32;at December 29
 2018 and included: U.S. Grocery
 U.S. Refrigerated
 Canada Retail
 Latin America Exports
 Southeast Europe
 Australia and New Zealand
&#32;with a heightened risk of future impairments
&#32;at December 29
 2018 and included: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
&#32;with a heightened risk of future impairments
&#32;excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2018 impairment testing date
 these amounts are also associated with the 2013 Heinz acquisition and the 2015 Merger and are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values. Therefore
 if any assumptions
 estimates
 or market factors change in the future
We generally utilize the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net cash flows for each reporting unit (including net sales
 cost of products sold
 SG&amp;A
 depreciation and amortization
 working capital
 and capital expenditures)
 income tax rates
 long-term growth rates
 and a discount rate that appropriately reflects the risks inherent in each future cash flow stream. We selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data
 supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions
 estimated product category growth rates
 management&#8217;s plans
We generally utilize the excess earnings method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of certain of our largest brands. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net cash flows for each brand (including net sales
 cost of products sold
 and SG&amp;A)
 contributory asset charges
 income tax considerations
 long-term growth rates
 a discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the future earnings attributable to the brand
 and management&#8217;s intent to invest in the brand indefinitely. We selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data
 supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions
 estimated product category growth rates
 management&#8217;s plans
We generally utilize the relief from royalty method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our remaining brands. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net sales for each brand
 royalty rates (as a percentage of net sales that would hypothetically be charged by a licensor of the brand to an unrelated licensee)
 income tax considerations
 long-term growth rates
 a discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the future cost savings attributable to the brand
 and management&#8217;s intent to invest in the brand indefinitely. We selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data
 supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions
 estimated product category growth rates
 management&#8217;s plans
The discount rates
 long-term growth rates
 and royalty rates we used to estimate the fair values of our reporting units and brands with 20% or less excess fair value over carrying amount
 as of the latest 2018 impairment testing date for each reporting unit or brand
Assumptions used in impairment testing are made at a point in time and require significant judgment; therefore
 they are subject to change based on the facts and circumstances present at each annual and interim impairment test date. Additionally
 these assumptions are generally interdependent and do not change in isolation. However
 as it is reasonably possible that changes in assumptions could occur
 as a sensitivity measure
 we have presented the estimated effects of isolated changes in discount rates
 long-term growth rates
 and royalty rates for our reporting units and brands with 20% or less excess fair value over carrying amount. If we had changed the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units and brands with 20% or less excess fair value over carrying amount
 as of the latest testing date for each of these reporting units and brands
 these isolated changes
 which are reasonably possible to occur
A reduction in fair value would not necessarily cause an impairment in all cases
 but due to the low or zero excess fair value over carrying amount for these reporting units and brands
Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated periods benefited. We review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse changes in the business climate
 current-period operating or cash flow losses
 significant declines in forecasted operations
 or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for impairment of definite-lived intangible assets held for use
 we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist
 the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on definite-lived intangible assets to be disposed of
 if any
 are based on the estimated proceeds to be received
See Note 10
 
 in Item 8
 
Although our annual impairment test is performed during the second quarter
 we perform a qualitative assessment each interim reporting period to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is below its carrying amount. While we have not completed such impairment assessment for the first fiscal quarter of 2019
 nor have we completed our 2019 annual impairment testing as of the first day of our second fiscal quarter
We maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. These include pension benefits
 postretirement health care benefits
 and defined contribution benefits. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over an appropriate term based on
 among other things
 the cost component and whether the plan is active or inactive. Changes in the fair value of our plan assets result in net actuarial gains or losses. These net actuarial gains and losses are deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) and amortized within other expense/(income)
For our postretirement benefit plans
 our 2019 health care cost trend rate assumption will be 6.7%. We established this rate based upon our most recent experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward. We anticipate the weighted average assumed ultimate trend rate will be 4.9%. The year in which the ultimate trend rate is reached varies by plan
 ranging between the years 2019 and 2030. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have had the following effects
 increase/(decrease) in cost and obligation
December&#160;29
Our 2019 discount rate assumption will be 4.3% for service cost and 4.1% for interest cost for our postretirement plans. Our 2019 discount rate assumption will be 4.6% for service cost and 4.4% for interest cost for our U.S. pension plans and 3.4% for service cost and 3.3% for interest cost for our non-U.S. pension plans. We model these discount rates using a portfolio of high quality
In 2016
 we changed the method we use to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net pension cost/(benefit) and net postretirement benefit plan costs resulting in a decrease to these cost components. We now use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Previously
Our 2019 expected return on plan assets will be 5.4% (net of applicable taxes) for our postretirement plans. Our 2019 expected rate of return on plan assets will be 5.7% for our U.S. pension plans and 5.4% for our non-U.S. pension plans. We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets&#8217; historical long-term investment performance
 current and future asset allocation
While we do not anticipate further changes in the 2019 assumptions for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans
 as a sensitivity measure
 a 100-basis-point change in our discount rate or a 100-basis-point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects
We compute our annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we earn income. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating the uncertainty of our tax positions. We recognize a benefit for tax positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained upon examination. The amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that we believe has more than a 50% probability of being realized upon settlement. We regularly monitor our tax positions and adjust the amount of recognized tax benefit based on our evaluation of information that has become available since the end of our last financial reporting period. The annual tax rate includes the impact of these changes in recognized tax benefits. When adjusting the amount of recognized tax benefits
 we do not consider information that has become available after the balance sheet date
We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances
 we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years
 we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs

We purchase and use large quantities of commodities
 including dairy products
 meat products
 coffee beans
 nuts
 tomatoes
 potatoes
 soybean and vegetable oils
 sugar and other sweeteners
 corn products
 and wheat products to manufacture our products. In addition
 we purchase and use significant quantities of resins
 metals
We define our key commodities in the United States and Canada as dairy
 meat
 coffee
 and nuts. In 2018
 we experienced cost decreases for dairy
 coffee
 and meat
 while costs for nuts increased. We manage commodity cost volatility primarily through pricing and risk management strategies. As a result of these risk management strategies
Dairy commodities
 primarily milk and cheese
 are the most significant cost components of our cheese products. We purchase our dairy raw material requirements from independent third parties
 such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors. Market supply and demand
 as well as government programs
 significantly influence the prices for milk and other dairy products. Significant cost components of our meat products include pork
 beef
 and poultry
 which we primarily purchase from applicable local markets. Livestock feed costs and the global supply and demand for U.S. meats influence the prices of these meat products. The most significant cost component of our coffee products is coffee beans
 which we purchase on global markets. Quality and availability of supply
 currency fluctuations
 and consumer demand for coffee products impact coffee bean prices. The most significant cost components in our nut products include peanuts
 cashews
 and almonds
 which we purchase on both domestic and global markets
We believe that cash generated from our operating activities
 commercial paper programs
 and Senior Credit Facility will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs
 future contractual obligations (including repayments of long-term debt)
 payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends
 planned capital expenditures
 restructuring expenditures
 and contributions to our postemployment benefit plans. An additional potential source of liquidity is access to capital markets. We intend to use our cash on hand and our commercial paper programs for daily funding requirements. Overall

. This increase was primarily driven by decreased postemployment benefit contributions in 2018
 the timing of income tax payments
 higher collections on trade receivables as fewer were non-cash exchanged for sold receivables in connection with the unwind of all of our accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs (the &#8220;Programs&#8221;) in 2018
 and decreased cash payments for employee bonuses in 2018. These increases in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by unfavorable changes in accounts payable

 lower collections on receivables as more were non-cash exchanged for sold receivables
 favorable changes in accounts payable from vendor payment term renegotiations that were less pronounced than the prior year
 and increased cash payments of employee bonuses in 2017. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by lower cash payments for income taxes in 2017 driven by our pre-funding of postretirement plan benefits following U.S. Tax Reform enactment on December 22

 including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased
 a pricing structure
 and approximate timing of the transaction. Several of these obligations are long-term and are based on minimum purchase requirements. Certain purchase obligations contain variable pricing components
 and
 as a result
 actual cash payments are expected to fluctuate based on changes in these variable components. Due to the proprietary nature of some of our materials and processes
Other long-term liabilities primarily consist of estimated payments for the one-time toll charge related to U.S. Tax Reform
 as well as postretirement benefit commitments. Certain other long-term liabilities related to income taxes

 our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per share of common stock
 which was payable on March 22
 2019 to shareholders of record on March 8
 2019. Additionally

 our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per share of common stock

 we redeemed all outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. Accordingly
 we no longer pay any associated dividends

The non-GAAP financial measures we provide in this report should be viewed in addition to
 and not as an alternative for
To supplement the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP
 we have presented Organic Net Sales
 Adjusted EBITDA
 and Adjusted EPS
 which are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies
 and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures in the same way. These measures are not substitutes for their comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures
 such as net sales
 net income/(loss)
 diluted earnings per common share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;)
 or other measures prescribed by U.S. GAAP
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. Management believes that presenting our non-GAAP financial measures (i.e.
 Organic Net Sales
 Adjusted EBITDA
 and Adjusted EPS) is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items
 (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget
 make operating and strategic decisions
 and evaluate historical performance
 and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our results. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures
to those measures
Organic Net Sales is defined as net sales excluding
 when they occur
 the impact of currency
 acquisitions and divestitures
 and a 53rd week of shipments. We calculate the impact of currency on net sales by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year&#8217;s exchange rate
 with the exception of Venezuela
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense
 other expense/(income)
 net
 provision for/(benefit from) income taxes
 and depreciation and amortization (excluding integration and restructuring expenses); in addition to these adjustments
 we exclude
 when they occur
 the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses
 deal costs
 unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges
 impairment losses
 losses/(gains) on the sale of a business
 other losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures (e.g.
 tax and hedging impacts)
 nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g.
 remeasurement gains and losses)
Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share excluding
 when they occur
 the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses
 deal costs
 unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges
 impairment losses
 losses/(gains) on the sale of a business
 other losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures (e.g.
 tax and hedging impacts)
 nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g.
 remeasurement gains and losses)
 and U.S. Tax Reform discrete income tax expense/(benefit)
 and including
 when they occur
 adjustments to reflect preferred stock dividend payments on an accrual basis. We believe Adjusted EPS provides important comparability of underlying operating results

For Adjusted EPS
 we present the impact of the Series A Preferred Stock dividend payments on an accrual basis. Accordingly
 we included adjustments to EPS to include $180 million Series A Preferred Stock dividends in the first quarter of 2016 (to reflect the March 7
 2016 Series A Preferred Stock dividend that was paid in December 2015) and to exclude $51 million of Series A Preferred Stock dividends from the second quarter of 2016 (to reflect that it was redeemed on June 7
U.S. Tax Reform discrete income tax expense/(benefit) was an expense of $104 million in 2018 and a benefit of $7.0 billion in 2017. Expenses in 2018 primarily related to the revaluation of our deferred tax balances due to changes in state tax laws following U.S. Tax Reform. These expenses were partially offset by net benefits related to changes in U.S. tax reserves
 U.S. Tax Reform measurement period adjustments
 changes in estimates of certain 2017 U.S. income tax deductions

We are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices
 foreign exchange rates
 and interest rates. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that volatility in these markets may have on our operating results. We maintain risk management policies that principally use derivative financial instruments to reduce significant
 unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may arise from variations in commodity prices
 foreign currency exchange rates
 and interest rates. We manage market risk by incorporating parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments
 the derivative strategies we use
 and the degree of market risk that we hedge with derivative instruments. See Note 3
 
 and Note 14
&#160;
 in Item 8
 
When we use financial instruments
 we are exposed to credit risk that a counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of our agreement. We minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings
 limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty
 and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. All of our non-exchange traded derivative contracts are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. By policy
 we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions
The potential gain or loss on the fair value of our outstanding commodity contracts
 foreign exchange contracts
 and cross-currency swap contracts
 assuming a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates
December 29
December 30
It should be noted that any change in the fair value of our derivative contracts
 real or hypothetical
 would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items. In relation to foreign currency contracts
 this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S.&#160;dollar. Our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. Changes in our portfolio of financial instruments are a function of our results of operations
 debt repayments and debt issuances
 market effects on debt and foreign currency

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Kraft Heinz Company and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 29
 2018 and December 30
 2017
 and the related consolidated statements of income
 comprehensive income
 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 29
 2018
 including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15 (a) (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 29
 2018
In our opinion
 the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of December 29
 2018 and December 30
 2017
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 29
 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion
 the Company did not maintain
 in all material respects
 effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 29
 2018
issued by the COSO because material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting existed as of that date related to the risk assessment component of internal control
A material weakness is a deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses referred to above are described in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. We considered these material weaknesses in determining the nature
 timing
consolidated financial statements
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements
4 to the consolidated financial statements
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements
 for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error or fraud
financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements
 whether due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
 assessing the risk that a material weakness exists
A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions

On July 2
 2015
 through a series of transactions
 we consummated the merger of Kraft Foods Group
 Inc. (&#8220;Kraft&#8221;) with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (&#8220;Heinz&#8221;) (the &#8220;2015 Merger&#8221;). At the closing of the 2015 Merger
&#32;(&#8220;Kraft Heinz&#8221;). Before the consummation of the 2015 Merger
 Heinz was controlled by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and 3G Global Food Holdings
 LP (&#8220;3G Global Food Holdings&#8221; and together with its affiliates
 &#8220;3G Capital&#8221;)
 following their acquisition of H. J. Heinz Company on June 7
The consolidated financial statements include Kraft Heinz
&#32;reportable segments defined by geographic region: United States
 Canada
Europe
 Middle East
Our segments reflect a change
 effective in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018
Asia Pacific
 Middle East
operating segment into the historical Europe reportable segment
&#32;See Note 22
 
In the fourth quarter of 2018
 we announced our plans to divest certain assets and operations
December&#160;29
 2018
 we have classified the assets and liabilities related to these disposal groups as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets. These assets and liabilities are included in assets held for sale within current assets and liabilities held for sale within current liabilities. See Note 5
 
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;)
 which requires us to make accounting policy elections
 estimates
 and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets
 liabilities
 reserves
 and expenses. These policy elections
 estimates
 and assumptions are based on our best estimates and judgments. We evaluate our policy elections
 estimates
 and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors
 including the current economic environment. We believe these estimates to be reasonable given the current facts available. We adjust our policy elections
 estimates
 and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Market volatility
 including foreign currency exchange rates
 increases the uncertainty inherent in our estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision

related to our procurement area
 specifically the accounting policies
 procedures
 and internal controls related to our procurement function
 including
 but not limited to
 agreements
 side agreements
 and changes or modifications to agreements with our suppliers. Following the receipt of this subpoena
 we
 together with external counsel and forensic accountants
 and subsequently
 under the oversight of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (the &#8220;Audit Committee&#8221;)
 conducted an internal investigation into the procurement area and related matters. As a result of the findings from this internal investigation
 which is now complete and which identified that multiple employees in the procurement area engaged in misconduct
In connection with the internal investigation
 we also conducted a comprehensive review of supplier contracts and related arrangements to identify other potential misstatements in the timing of the recognition of supplier rebates
 incentive payments
 and pricing arrangements. The review identified further misstatements
 which we also investigated and have been unable to conclude if they resulted from the misconduct described above. 
&#32;relating to the periods up through September 29
&#32;for fiscal year 2018
&#32;for fiscal year 2017
&#32;for fiscal year 2016
We do not believe that the misstatements are quantitatively material to any period presented in our prior financial statements. However
 due to the qualitative nature of the matters identified in our internal investigation
 including the number of years over which the misconduct occurred and the number of transactions
 suppliers
 and procurement employees involved
Accordingly
 we have restated herein our consolidated financial statements at December 30
 2017 and for the fiscal years ended December 30
 2017 and December 31
 2016
 in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 250
In addition to the misstatements related to the supplier contracts and related arrangements
 including the misstatements related to lease classification
 we corrected additional identified out-of-period and uncorrected misstatements that were not material
 individually or in the aggregate
These misstatements were related to customer incentive program expense misclassifications
 balance sheet misclassifications
 income taxes
 impairments
 and other misstatements

In connection with the internal investigation
 we also conducted a comprehensive review of supplier contracts and related arrangements to identify other potential misstatements in the timing of the recognition of supplier rebates
 incentive payments
 and pricing arrangements. The review identified further misstatements
&#32;The impacts of the supplier rebate misstatements on each period are discussed in restatement reference (a) throughout this note and in Note 23
As part of our review of supplier contracts and related arrangements in connection with the internal investigation
 we evaluated additional elements of such arrangements
 including the classification of embedded lease provisions as capital or operating. We had initially classified certain embedded lease provisions as capital leases and allocated their fixed consideration to the lease components. As a result of our analysis
 and also taking into consideration
 among other elements
 the total value of supplier contracts and related arrangements
we determined that the classification of the embedded lease element for certain contracts should have been classified as an operating lease instead of a capital lease. In addition
The impacts of the capital lease misstatements on each period are discussed in restatement reference (b) throughout this note and in Note 23
As previously disclosed in March 2018
 we retrospectively corrected immaterial misclassifications in our statements of income principally related to customer incentive program expense misclassifications. The impacts of the customer incentive program expense misclassifications on each period are discussed in restatement reference (c) throughout this note and in Note 23
We recorded adjustments to recognize certain balance sheet misclassifications in the correct period. These adjustments primarily related to the classification of state income taxes
 capital expenditures
 and the classification of products held at co-packer locations. The impacts of the balance sheet misclassifications on each period are discussed in restatement reference (d) throughout this note and in Note 23
We recorded adjustments to recognize certain income tax items in the correct period
 primarily deferred tax adjustments related to a Brazilian subsidiary
 as well as return-to-provision adjustments and various other misclassifications. The income tax impacts of all misstatements outside of this category are included in their respective misstatement categories. The impacts of income tax misstatements on each period are discussed in restatement reference (e) throughout this note and in Note 23
We recorded an adjustment to recognize certain non-cash impairment losses in the correct period. In 2018
 we had determined that a definite-lived intangible asset had been impaired in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to a license termination in that period and recorded an out-of-period correction to recognize the non-cash impairment loss. In addition
 we recorded an adjustment to correct goodwill impairment losses related to our Australia and New Zealand reporting unit
 which had been overstated. The impacts of the impairment misstatements on each period are discussed in restatement reference (f) throughout this note and in Note 23
We recorded adjustments to correct other identified out-of-period and uncorrected misstatements that were not material
 individually or in the aggregate
 to our consolidated financial statements. These other misstatements were primarily related to structured payable and product financing arrangements
 postemployment benefit plans
 inventory write-offs
 certain accrued liabilities
 and other misstatements within net sales and certain income tax and balance sheet accounts. The impacts of the other misstatements on each period are discussed in restatement reference (g) throughout this note and in Note 23

Our revenues are primarily derived from customer orders for the purchase of our products. We recognize revenues as performance obligations are fulfilled when control passes to our customers. We record revenues net of variable consideration
 including consumer incentives and performance obligations related to trade promotions
 excluding taxes
Advertising
 Consumer Incentives
We promote our products with advertising
 consumer incentives
 and performance obligations related to trade promotions. Consumer incentives and trade promotions include
 but are not limited to
 discounts
 coupons
 rebates
 performance-based in-store display activities
 and volume-based incentives. Variable consideration related to consumer incentive and trade promotion activities is recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization

We recognize compensation costs related to equity awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award
&#32;years. These costs are primarily recognized within SG&amp;A. We estimate expected forfeitures rather than recognizing forfeitures as they occur in determining our equity award compensation costs. We classify equity award compensation costs primarily within general corporate expenses. See Note 12
 
We maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. These include pension benefits
 postretirement health care benefits
 and defined contribution benefits. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over an appropriate term based on
 among other things
 the cost component and whether the plan is active or inactive. Changes in the fair value of our plan assets result in net actuarial gains or losses. These net actuarial gains and losses are deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) and amortized within other expense/(income)
&#32;See Note 13
 
We recognize income taxes based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and record deferred tax assets or liabilities for any difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We also recognize deferred tax assets for temporary differences
 operating loss carryforwards
 and tax credit carryforwards. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans
 planning opportunities
 and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets
 primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards
We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly
We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances
 we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years
 we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs
 along with a corresponding adjustment to our provision for/(benefit from) income taxes. The resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period
Dividends are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. When we have an accumulated deficit
Cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents that are legally restricted as to withdrawal or usage is classified in other current assets or other non-current assets

&#32;years. Capitalized software costs are included in property
 plant and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software
&#32;years. We review long-lived assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse changes in the business climate
 current-period operating or cash flow losses
 significant declines in forecasted operations
 or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for impairment of assets held for use
 we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist
 the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of
 if any
 are based on the estimated proceeds to be received
&#32;reporting units
We test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter
 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount. Such events and circumstances could include a sustained decrease in our market capitalization
 increased competition or unexpected loss of market share
 increased input costs beyond projections (for example due to regulatory or industry changes)
 disposals of significant brands or components of our business
 unexpected business disruptions (for example due to a natural disaster or loss of a customer
 supplier
 or other significant business relationship)
 unexpected significant declines in operating results
 or significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate. We test reporting units for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. We test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value
 we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount
 in the case of reporting units
Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated periods benefited. We review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse changes in the business climate
 current-period operating or cash flow losses
 significant declines in forecasted operations
 or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for impairment of definite-lived intangible assets held for use
 we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist
 the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on definite-lived intangible assets to be disposed of
 if any
 are based on the estimated proceeds to be received
See Note 10
 
As we source our commodities on global markets and periodically enter into financing or other arrangements abroad
 we use a variety of risk management strategies and financial instruments to manage commodity price
 foreign currency exchange rate
 and interest rate risks. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. One way we do this is through actively hedging our risks through the use of derivative instruments. As a matter of policy
 we do not use highly leveraged derivative instruments
Derivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value
Certain derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment
 while others are not designated as hedging instruments and are marked to market through net income/(loss). The gains and losses on cash flow hedges are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) and are recognized in net income/(loss) at the time the hedged item affects net income/(loss)
 in the same line item as the underlying hedged item. The excluded component on cash flow hedges is recognized in net income/(loss) over the life of the hedging relationship in the same income statement line item as the underlying hedged item. We also designate certain derivatives and non-derivatives as net investment hedges to hedge the net assets of certain foreign subsidiaries which are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in the value of these derivatives and remeasurements of our non-derivatives designated as net investment hedges are calculated each period using the spot method
 with changes reported in foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses). Such amounts will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of our investment in the underlying foreign operations. The excluded component on derivatives designated as net investment hedges is recognized in net income/(loss) within interest expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses related to derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments is determined based on the underlying intent of the contracts. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item
To qualify for hedge accounting
 a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged must be achieved at inception and maintained throughout the hedged period. When a hedging instrument no longer meets the specified level of hedging effectiveness
 we reclassify the related hedge gains or losses previously deferred into other comprehensive income/(losses) to net income within other expense/(income)
 net. We formally document our risk management objectives
 our strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions
 the nature of and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items
 and the method for assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally
 for qualified hedges of forecasted transactions
 we specifically identify the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transactions. If it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur
Unrealized gains and losses on our commodity derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in cost of products sold and are included within general corporate expenses until realized. Once realized
 the gains and losses are included within the applicable segment operating results. See Note 14
&#160;
We have numerous investments in our foreign subsidiaries
 the net assets of which are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage this risk by utilizing derivative and non-derivative instruments
 including cross-currency swap contracts
 foreign exchange contracts
We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany actual and forecasted transactions. Our principal foreign currency exposures that are hedged include the British pound sterling
 euro
&#160;From time to time
 we have used derivative instruments
 including interest rate swaps
&#32;We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily&#160;use as raw materials.&#160;We enter into commodity purchase contracts primarily for dairy products
 meat products
 coffee beans
 sugar
 vegetable&#160;oils
 wheat products
 corn products
&#160;and cocoa products. These commodity purchase contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative&#160;instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases and normal sales exception. We also use commodity futures
 options
 and swaps to&#160;economically hedge the price of certain commodity costs
 including the commodities noted above
 as well as packaging products
 diesel fuel
For all significant foreign operations
We apply highly inflationary accounting if the cumulative inflation rate in an economy for a three-year period meets or exceeds 100%. Under highly inflationary accounting
 the financial statements of a subsidiary are remeasured into our reporting currency (U.S. dollars) based on the legally available exchange rate at which we expect to settle the underlying transactions. Exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in net income/(loss)
 rather than accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) on the balance sheet

&#32;This ASU became effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018. Under the new guidance
 the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost must be presented in the same statement of income line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period. Other components of net periodic benefit cost must be disaggregated from the service cost component in the statements of income and must be presented outside the operating income/(loss) subtotal.

 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09
&#32;Under this ASU
 companies must apply a five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU may be applied using a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective transition method
The ASU also provides for certain practical expedients
 including the option to expense as incurred the incremental costs of obtaining a contract
We adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2018 using the full retrospective method and the practical expedient described above. Upon adoption
 we made the following policy elections: (i) we account for shipping and handling costs as contract fulfillment costs
 and (ii) we exclude taxes imposed on and collected from customers in revenue producing transactions (e.g.

In January 2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 related to goodwill impairment testing. This ASU eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under the new guidance
 if a reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount exceeds its fair value
&#32;Previously
 if the fair value of a reporting unit was lower than its carrying amount (Step 1)
 an entity was required to calculate any impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount (Step 2). Additionally
 under the new standard
 companies that have reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts will no longer be required to perform the qualitative assessment to determine whether to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. As a result
 reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts will generally be expected to pass the simplified impairment test; however
We early adopted this guidance on a prospective basis as of April 1
 2018 (our annual impairment testing date in the second quarter of 2018). As a result of adopting this ASU
 we no longer perform Step 2 while completing our goodwill impairment testing
In August 2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-12 related to accounting for hedging activities. This guidance impacted the accounting for financial (e.g.
 foreign exchange and interest rate) and non-financial (e.g.
 commodity) hedging activities. We early adopted this guidance on a modified retrospective basis in the third quarter of 2018. Upon adoption
Defer changes in the spot rate of the hedging instrument into other comprehensive income/(loss)
 while the excluded component (i.e.
 forward points or option premiums or discounts) is amortized into net income/(loss) over the life of the hedging relationship. When the excluded component is released or the forecasted transaction occurs
Additionally
 ASU 2017-12 eliminated the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness; therefore

 and Note 15
 
In February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 to establish the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the amount
 timing
The ASU also provides for certain practical expedients. Among the practical expedients is an optional transition method that allows companies to apply the guidance at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings/(deficit) on the adoption date. We plan to elect this practical expedient upon adoption. We also plan to elect the package of practical expedients that will allow us to carry forward our determination of whether a lease exists
 the classification of a lease
 and whether initial direct lease costs exist for purposes of transition to the new standard. We do not expect to use the hindsight practical expedient. We do plan to elect the land easement option
We have completed our scoping reviews
 identified our significant leases by geography and by asset type
 and developed our accounting policies and expected policy elections
 which will take effect upon adoption of the standard. We have executed our lease data extraction strategy and completed data extraction efforts. Our identified accounting system
 which will support the future state leasing process
 is also ready for implementation. We have completed our future state process design as part of the overall system implementation. Upon adoption
 we expect that our financial statement disclosures will be expanded to present additional details of our leasing arrangements. We expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements. We currently estimate that
 upon adoption
In June 2016
This ASU applies to financial assets measured at amortized cost
 including loans
 held-to-maturity debt securities
 net investments in leases
 and trade accounts receivable as well as certain off-balance sheet credit exposures
In February 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-02 related to reclassifying tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (&#8220;U.S. Tax Reform&#8221;) enacted on December 22
U.S. Tax Reform reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%. ASC Topic 740
 
 requires the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of such changes in tax laws or rates to be presented in net income/(loss) from continuing operations. However
This ASU allows companies to reclassify such stranded tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) to retained earnings/(deficit). This reclassification adjustment is optional
 and if elected
Additionally
In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-13 related to fair value measurement disclosures. This ASU removes the requirement to disclose the amount of and reasons for transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy
 the policy for determining that a transfer has occurred
 and valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. Additionally
 this ASU modifies the disclosures related to the measurement uncertainty for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements (by removing the requirement to disclose sensitivity to future changes) and the timing of liquidation of investee assets (by removing the timing requirement in certain instances). The guidance also requires new disclosures for Level 3 financial assets and liabilities
 including the amount and location of unrealized gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) and additional information related to significant unobservable inputs used in determining Level 3 fair value measurements. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020. Early adoption of the guidance in whole is permitted. Alternatively
 companies may early adopt removed or modified disclosures and delay adoption of the additional disclosures until their effective date. Certain of the amendments in this ASU must be applied prospectively upon adoption
 while other amendments must be applied retrospectively upon adoption. We elected to early adopt the provisions related to removing disclosures in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2018 on a retrospective basis. Accordingly
 we have removed information related to our valuation process for Level 3 fair value measurements for pension plan investments within Note 13
. We also removed information about the amount of and reasons for transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy from Note 14
In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-14 related to the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The guidance requires sponsors of these plans to provide additional disclosures
 including weighted-average interest rates used in the company&#8217;s cash balance plans and a narrative description of reasons for any significant gains or losses impacting the benefit obligation for the period. Additionally
In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-15 related to accounting for implementation costs incurred in hosted cloud computing service arrangements. Under the new guidance
 implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract should be expensed or capitalized based on the nature of the costs and the project stage during which such costs are incurred. If the implementation costs qualify for capitalization
 they must be amortized over the term of the hosting arrangement and assessed for impairment. Companies must disclose the nature of any hosted cloud computing service arrangements. This ASU also provides guidance for balance sheet and income statement presentation of capitalized implementation costs and statement of cash flows presentation for the related payments. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020. Early adoption is permitted
On March 9
 2018 (the &#8220;Acquisition Date&#8221;)

&#32;This goodwill was allocated to Rest of World as shown in Note 10
We valued trademarks using the relief from royalty method and customer-related assets using the distributor method. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in developing the valuations included the estimated annual net cash flows for each definite-lived intangible asset (including net sales
 cost of products sold
 selling and marketing costs
 and working capital/contributory asset charges)
 the discount rate that appropriately reflects the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream
 the assessment of each asset&#8217;s life cycle
 and competitive trends
 as well as other factors. We determined the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data
 supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions
 estimated product category growth rates
 management plans
We used carrying values as of the Acquisition Date to value trade receivables and payables
 as well as certain other current and non-current assets and liabilities
We valued property

As part of our restructuring activities
 we incur expenses that qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP. These include severance and employee benefit costs and other exit costs. Severance and employee benefit costs primarily relate to cash severance
 non-cash severance
 including accelerated equity award compensation expense
 and pension and other termination benefits. Other exit costs primarily relate to lease and contract terminations. We also incur expenses that are an integral component of
 and directly attributable to
 our restructuring activities
 which do not qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP. These include asset-related costs and other implementation costs. Asset-related costs primarily relate to accelerated depreciation and asset impairment charges. Other implementation costs primarily relate to start-up costs of new facilities
 professional fees
 asset relocation costs
 costs to exit facilities
Employee severance and other termination benefit packages are primarily determined based on established benefit arrangements
 local statutory requirements
 or historical benefit practices. We recognize the contractual component of these benefits when payment is probable and estimable; additional elements of severance and termination benefits associated with non-recurring benefits are recognized ratably over each employee&#8217;s required future service period. Charges for accelerated depreciation are recognized on long-lived assets that will be taken out of service before the end of their normal service
 in which case depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life. Asset impairments establish a new fair value basis for assets held for disposal or sale
At the end of 2017
 we had substantially completed our multi-year program announced following the 2015 Merger (the &#8220;Integration Program&#8221;)

&#32;We test our reporting units for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter
&#32;as of April 1
 2018. We utilized the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. As a result of our 2018 annual impairment test
For the fourth quarter of 2018
 in connection with the preparation of our year-end financial statements
 we assessed the changes in circumstances that occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair values of any reporting units were below their carrying amounts. Although our annual impairment test is performed during the second quarter
While there was no single determinative event or factor
&#32;reporting units
 including U.S. Grocery
 U.S. Refrigerated
 Canada Retail
 Australia and New Zealand
 Northeast Asia
 Southeast Asia
 and Other Latin America
These factors included: (i) a sustained decrease in our share price in November and December of 2018
 which reduced our market capitalization below the book value of net assets; (ii) the completion of our fourth quarter results
 which were below management&#8217;s expectations due to several factors such as higher than expected supply chain costs and increased competition; (iii) the development and approval of our 2019 annual operating plan in December 2018
 which provided additional insights into expectations and priorities for the coming years
 such as lower growth and margin expectations; (iv) the announcement in November 2018 to sell certain assets in our natural cheese portfolio in Canada
 which changed the composition and use of the remaining assets and brands in the associated reporting unit; (v) fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in certain countries; (vi) increased interest rates in certain locations
&#32;reporting units were below their carrying amounts
 we performed an interim impairment test on these reporting units as of December 29
 2018. After assessing the totality of circumstances
As a result of our interim test
&#32;reporting units
 including U.S. Refrigerated
 Canada Retail
 Southeast Asia
 Northeast Asia
&#32;reporting units we tested were determined to not be impaired. We utilized the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. Drivers of these impairment losses
 by reporting unit
&#32;impairment loss in our U.S. Refrigerated reporting unit within our United States segment due to revised 2019 base and future year margin expectations
 primarily in the natural cheese and meats categories
 and
 to a lesser extent
 expectations for lower long-term net sales growth in the natural and processed cheese categories. Changes in future year margin expectations were primarily driven by sustained increases in supply chain costs
 expectations for lower pricing to maintain competitive positioning
 and expectations for increased marketing investments
 primarily in response to private label competition
 as well as customer-driven packaging investments. Changes in expectations for lower long-term net sales growth were primarily due to sustained private label competition and anticipated trends in consumer preferences. Our revised expectations were based on the completion of our fourth quarter results
 which were below management&#8217;s expectations
 and the development of our 2019 annual operating plan in December 2018. Additionally
 our revised expectations were based on the development of our global five-year operating plan
&#32;impairment loss in our Canada Retail reporting unit within our Canada segment due to lower positive net sales growth expectations and revised 2019 base and future year margin expectations
 as well as the reassessment of our Canadian operations following the announcement in November to sell certain assets in our natural cheese portfolio in Canada. We revised our net sales growth expectations primarily due to our expected exit of the natural cheese category and expected declines in the coffee category (exclusive of our coffee business acquisition in Canada in 2018). Our revised expectations were based on the completion of our fourth quarter results
 which were below management&#8217;s expectations
&#32;impairment loss in our Southeast Asia reporting unit within our Rest of World segment due to margin and net sales declines in the seafood and seasonal cordials categories and foreign exchange rate declines in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Our revised expectations were based on the completion of our fourth quarter results
 which were below management&#8217;s expectations
&#32;impairment loss in our Northeast Asia reporting unit within our Rest of World segment due to margin and net sales declines as well as foreign exchange rate declines in Japan and Korea. Our revised expectations were based on the completion of our fourth quarter results
 which were below management&#8217;s expectations
&#32;impairment loss in our Other Latin America reporting unit within our Rest of World segment due to net sales and margin declines in the region. Our revised expectations were based on the completion of our fourth quarter results

 primarily due to lower long-term net sales growth expectations in the natural cheese category in the United States
 lower net sales growth expectations in the processed cheese category in the United States and Canada
 and the exit of the natural cheese category in Canada announced in November 2018. Changes in expectations for lower net sales growth were primarily due to distribution losses driven by sustained private label competition and anticipated trends in consumer preferences. Our revised expectations were based on the completion of our fourth quarter results

 and the development of our 2019 annual operating plan in December 2018. Additionally
 our revised expectations were based on the development of our global five-year operating plan

On December 22
 2017
 U.S. Tax Reform legislation was enacted by the federal government. The legislation significantly changed U.S. tax laws by
 among other things
 lowering the federal corporate tax rate from 
 effective January 1
 2018 and imposing a one-time toll charge on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 30
 2017. In addition
 there were many new provisions
 including changes to bonus depreciation
 revised deductions for executive compensation and interest expense
 a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (&#8220;GILTI&#8221;)
 the base erosion anti-abuse tax (&#8220;BEAT&#8221;)
 and a deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (&#8220;FDII&#8221;). While the corporate tax rate reduction was effective January 1
 2018
 we accounted for this anticipated rate change in 2017
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 issued by the SEC in December 2017 provided us with up to one year to finalize accounting for the impacts of U.S. Tax Reform and allowed for provisional estimates when actual amounts could not be determined. As of December 30
 2017
 we had made estimates of our deferred income tax benefit related to the corporate rate change
 the toll charge
 certain components of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities
 including depreciation and executive compensation
 and a change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion. In connection with U.S. Tax Reform
 we reassessed our international investment assertion and no longer consider the historic earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 30
 2017 to be indefinitely reinvested. We made an estimate of local country withholding taxes that would be owed when our historic earnings are distributed. Additionally
Our initial accounting for U.S. Tax Reform as of December 30
 2017 resulted in a net tax benefit of approximately&#160;

U.S. state and local income taxes
The provision for income taxes consists of provisions for federal
 state
 and foreign income taxes. We operate in an international environment; accordingly
 the consolidated effective tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the earnings in various locations and the applicable tax rates. Additionally
 the calculation of the percentage point impact of U.S. Tax Reform
 tax exempt income
 and other items on the effective tax rate shown in the table above are affected by income/(loss) before income taxes. Fluctuations in the amount of income generated across locations around the world could impact comparability of reconciling items between periods. Additionally
The 2018 effective tax rate was lower
 primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. federal statutory rate
 non-deductible items (including goodwill impairments
 nonmonetary currency devaluation losses
 and the wind-up of non-U.S. pension plans)
 the impact of the federal tax on GILTI
 and the revaluation of our deferred tax balances due to changes in state tax laws following U.S. Tax Reform
&#32;See Note 10
 
The tax provision for the 2017 tax year benefited from U.S. Tax Reform enacted on December 22

The risk-free interest rate represented the constant maturity U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the grant date
 with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options. The expected life is the period over which our employees are expected to hold their options. Due to the lack of historical data
 we calculated expected life using the Safe Harbor method
 which uses the weighted average vesting period and the contractual term of the options. In 2018
 we estimated volatility using a blended volatility approach of term-matched historical volatility from our daily stock prices and weighted average implied volatility. In 2017 and 2016
 we estimated volatility using a blended approach of implied volatility and peer volatility. We calculated peer volatility as the average of the term-matched
 leverage-adjusted historical volatilities of Colgate-Palmolive Co.

The underlying basis of the investment strategy of our defined benefit plans is to ensure that pension funds are available to meet the plans&#8217; benefit obligations when they are due. Our investment objectives include: investing plan assets in a high-quality
 diversified manner in order to maintain the security of the funds; achieving an optimal return on plan assets within specified risk tolerances; and investing according to local regulations and requirements specific to each country in which a defined benefit plan operates. The investment strategy expects equity investments to yield a higher return over the long term than fixed-income securities
 while fixed-income securities are expected to provide certain matching characteristics to the plans&#8217; benefit payment cash flow requirements. Our investment policy specifies the type of investment vehicles appropriate for the applicable plan

We have a subsidiary in Venezuela that manufactures and sells a variety of products
We apply highly inflationary accounting to the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary and include these results in our consolidated financial statements. Under highly inflationary accounting
 the functional currency of our Venezuelan subsidiary is the U.S. dollar (the reporting currency of Kraft Heinz)
 although the majority of its transactions are in Venezuelan bolivars. As a result
 we must revalue the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary to U.S. dollars. We revalue the income statement using daily weighted average DICOM (as defined below) rates
 and we revalue the bolivar denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the period-end DICOM spot rate. The resulting revaluation gains and losses are recorded in current net income/(loss)
 rather than accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses). These gains and losses are classified within other expense/(income)

our Venezuelan subsidiary has sufficient U.S. dollars to fund these operational needs in the foreseeable future. However
 further deterioration of the economic environment or regulation changes could jeopardize our export business. Our Venezuelan subsidiary has increasingly sourced production inputs locally
 including tomato paste and sugar
 in order to reduce reliance on U.S. dollars
Our results of operations in Venezuela reflect a controlled subsidiary. We continue to have sufficient currency liquidity and pricing flexibility to control our operations. However

During 2018
In the second quarter of 2018
 we unwound our U.S. securitization program
 which represented the majority of our Programs
December&#160;29
 2018
We operated the Programs such that we generally utilized the majority of the available aggregate cash consideration limits. We accounted for transfers of receivables pursuant to the Programs as a sale and removed them from our consolidated balance sheets. Under the Programs
 we generally received cash consideration up to a certain limit and recorded a non-cash exchange for sold receivables for the remainder of the purchase price. We maintained a &#8220;beneficial interest
&#8221; or a right to collect cash

Our U.S. securitization program utilized a bankruptcy-remote special-purpose entity (&#8220;SPE&#8221;). The SPE was wholly-owned by a subsidiary of Kraft Heinz
 and its sole business consisted of the purchase or acceptance
 through capital contributions
 of receivables and related assets from a Kraft Heinz subsidiary and the subsequent transfer of such receivables and related assets to a bank. Although the SPE is included in our consolidated financial statements
 it was a separate legal entity with separate creditors who were entitled
 upon its liquidation in the second quarter of 2018
Additionally
 we enter into various structured payable and product financing arrangements to facilitate supply from our vendors. Balance sheet classification is based on the nature of the agreements. For certain arrangements

 was filed on February 26
 2019 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against
 among others
&#32;of its current and former officers (the &#8220;Walling Action&#8221;). Plaintiff in the Walling Action filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of his complaint
 without prejudice
 on April 26
Plaintiffs in these lawsuits purport to represent a class of all individuals and entities who purchased
 sold
 or otherwise acquired or disposed of publicly traded securities of the Company (including in the Timber Hill Action
 the purchase of call options on Company common stock
 the sale of put options on Company common stock
 and the purchase of futures on the Company&#8217;s common stock) from May 4

 2019
 in the case of the Hedick Action and the Walling Action
 and from July 6
 2015 through February 21

 in the case of the Iron Workers Action and the Timber Hill Action. The complaints assert claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;)
 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder
 based on allegedly materially false or misleading statements and omissions in public statements

 2017 through February 21
 2019.&#160; The complaint alleges violations of Section 502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;) based on alleged breaches of obligations as fiduciaries subject to ERISA by allowing the Master Trust to continue investing in our common stock.&#160;The plaintiffs seek damages in an unspecified amount

As previously disclosed on February 21

 we received a subpoena in October 2018 from the SEC related to our procurement area
 specifically the accounting policies
 procedures
 and internal controls related to our procurement function
 including
 but not limited to
 agreements
 side agreements
 and changes or modifications to agreements with our suppliers. Following the receipt of this subpoena
 we
 together with external counsel and forensic accountants
 and subsequently
 under the oversight of the Audit Committee
 conducted an internal investigation into our procurement area and related matters. Following our earnings release and investor call on February 21
 2019
 when we announced the results of our interim assessment of goodwill and intangible asset impairments
 the SEC requested additional information related to our financial reporting
 internal controls
 and disclosures
 our assessment of goodwill and intangible asset impairments
 and our communications with certain shareholders. It is our understanding that the United States Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Northern District of Illinois also is reviewing this matter
&#32;We cannot predict the eventual scope
 duration or outcome of any potential SEC legal action or other action or whether it could have a material impact on our financial condition
 results of operations
As a result of our review of supplier contracts and related arrangements
we determined that the classification of the embedded lease element for certain contracts should have been classified as an operating lease instead of a capital lease. In addition
Therefore
 future obligations associated with operating leases and purchase obligations have been restated below. See Note 2

However
 as previously disclosed
 on March 22

 we entered into a Waiver and Consent No. 1 (the &#8220;Original Waiver&#8221;) with respect to the Senior Credit Facility

 N.A.
 as administrative agent
 granted a temporary waiver of compliance by us with respect to the requirement to furnish the lenders a copy of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December&#160;29
 2018. Pursuant to the Original Waiver
 we were required to provide consolidated financial statements no later than May 14
 2019. Due to additional delays in our financial reporting
 on May 10
 2019
 we entered into a Waiver and Consent No. 2 (the &#8220;Second Waiver&#8221;) with respect to the Senior Credit Facility
 pursuant to which the lenders

Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense
 other expense/(income)

 provision for/(benefit from) income taxes
 and depreciation and amortization (excluding integration and restructuring expenses); in addition to these adjustments
 we exclude
 when they occur
 the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses
 deal costs
 unrealized gains/(losses) on commodity hedges (the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized; once realized
 the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment&#8217;s operating results)
 impairment losses
 gains/(losses) on the sale of a business
 other gains/(losses) related to acquisitions and divestitures (e.g.
 tax and hedging impacts)
 nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g.
 remeasurement gains and losses)

 2017. See Note 2
 
The following tables represent our restated unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for each quarter-to-date and year-to-date interim period within the nine months ended September 29
 2018 and the fiscal year ended December 30
The values as previously reported for the fiscal quarters ended September 29

 and March 31
 2018 were derived from our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed on November 2

 respectively. The values as previously reported for the fiscal quarter ended December 30

In addition
 the condensed consolidated statements of income for the interim periods within the year ended December 30
 2017
 as previously reported
 did not originally reflect the adoption of ASU 2017-07 related to the presentation of net periodic benefit cost (pension and postretirement cost). This ASU was adopted in the first quarter of 2018 and was applied retrospectively for statement of income presentation of service cost components and other net periodic benefit cost components. Our condensed consolidated statements of income for the interim periods within fiscal year 2017 have been recast accordingly. See Note 4

We have restated herein our previously issued condensed consolidating financial statements for fiscal years 2017 and 2016. Following the restated condensed consolidating financial statement tables
 we have presented our condensed consolidating financial statements as previously reported for fiscal years 2017 and 2016
 which were derived from our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30
 2017 filed on February 16
 2018. See Note 2
 
 for additional information
In addition
 the statements of income for fiscal years 2017 and 2016
 as previously reported
 did not originally reflect the adoption of ASU 2017-07 related to the presentation of net periodic benefit cost (pension and postretirement cost). This ASU was adopted in the first quarter of 2018 and was applied retrospectively for statement of income presentation of service cost components and other net periodic benefit cost components. The condensed consolidating statements of income for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 have been recast accordingly. See Note 4
 
Kraft Heinz fully and unconditionally guarantees the notes issued by our 100% owned operating subsidiary
 KHFC
 including the New Notes. See Note 19
 
Set forth below are the condensed consolidating financial statements presenting the results of operations
 financial position
 and cash flows of Kraft Heinz (as parent guarantor)
 KHFC (as subsidiary issuer of the notes)
 and the non-guarantor subsidiaries on a combined basis and eliminations necessary to arrive at the total reported information on a consolidated basis. This condensed consolidating financial information has been prepared and presented pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Rule 3-10
 &#8220;Financial Statements of Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities Registered or being Registered.&#8221; This information is not intended to present the financial position
 results of operations
 and cash flows of the individual companies or groups of companies in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Eliminations represent adjustments to eliminate investments in subsidiaries and intercompany balances and transactions between or among the parent guarantor

Our management
 with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 29
 2018. Based on that evaluation
 our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December&#160;29
 2018
 due to the existence of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below
 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized
 and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms
pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
Under the supervision and with the participation of management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December&#160;29
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation
 our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 29
A material weakness is a deficiency
 or combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
We identified a material weakness in the risk assessment component of internal control as we did not appropriately design controls in response to the risk of misstatement due to changes in our business environment. This material weakness in risk assessment gave rise to the specific control deficiencies described below
: We did not design and maintain effective controls over the accounting for supplier contracts and related arrangements. Specifically
 certain employees in our procurement organization engaged in misconduct and circumvented controls that included withholding information or directing others to withhold information related to supplier contracts that affected the accounting for certain supplier rebates
 incentives
 and pricing arrangements
 in an attempt to influence the achievement of internal financial targets that became or were perceived to have become increasingly difficult to attain due to changes in our business environment. Additionally
 in certain instances
: We did not design and maintain effective controls to reassess the level of precision used to review the impairment assessments related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as changes in our business environment occurred. Specifically
 we did not design and maintain effective controls to reassess the level of precision used in the review of the allocation of cash flow projections to certain brands used as a basis for performing our fourth quarter 2018 interim impairment assessments in response to the significant reduction in
 and in certain instances elimination of
Additionally
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
 an independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December&#160;29
 2018
 as stated in their report which appears herein under Item 8
We are evaluating the material weaknesses and developing a plan of remediation to strengthen our internal controls related to our risk assessment component of internal control over financial reporting
 supplier contracts and related arrangements
 and the level of precision applied to the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing process. The remediation efforts summarized below
 which are in the process of being implemented
Personnel Actions&#8212;A comprehensive disciplinary plan is in the process of being implemented for all employees found to have engaged in misconduct
 including termination
 written warnings
Performance Targets&#8212;We have identified and will be implementing several performance-based target enhancements as follows: (i) implementing checkpoints to evaluate significant changes in the environment that could adversely impact the attainability of management goals and targets; (ii) reassessing and adjusting the overall balance of performance measures provided to employees to help drive challenging but attainable targets; and (iii) enhancing our training and overall communication specific to the Management by Objective (&#8220;MBO&#8221;) process
 including a focus on the process to request relief from previously established MBOs
 to help ensure all eligible employees are aware of and understand the overall MBO waiver and relief process; (iv) reinforcing the importance of adherence to established internal controls and company policies and procedures through other formal communications
 town hall meetings
Organizational Enhancements&#8212;We have identified and are in the process of implementing organizational enhancements as follows: (i) augmenting our procurement finance teams with additional professionals with the appropriate levels of accounting and controls knowledge
 experience
Procurement Practices&#8212;We have evaluated our procurement practices and are in the process of implementing improvements to those practices
 including: (i) developing more comprehensive contract approval policies and processes; (ii) enhancing required communication protocols among all functions involved in the procurement process (e.g.
 procurement
 legal
 accounting
Training Practices&#8212;We are in the process of developing a comprehensive global procurement training program that will cover supplier contracts and related arrangements
 including potential accounting implications. As part of this effort
 we have held mandatory training for our global procurement function
 which focused on our policies and procedures related to procurement
Procurement Management Software&#8212;We have started to evaluate potential solutions to implement or upgrade the existing procurement management software to enhance the identification
 tracking
Level of Precision Applied to Impairment Testing&#8212;We are in the process of implementing a plan to enhance the level of precision at which our internal controls over financial reporting relating to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessments are performed. Specifically
We believe the measures described above will remediate the material weaknesses we have identified and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. We are committed to continuing to improve our internal control processes and have begun to implement some of the steps described above. We will also continue to review
 optimize
 and enhance our financial reporting controls and procedures. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting
 we may take additional measures to address control deficiencies or we may modify certain of the remediation measures described above. These material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded
 through testing
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 with other members of management
 evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the&#160;three months&#160;ended&#160;December&#160;29
 2018.&#160;We determined that there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the&#160;three months&#160;ended&#160;December&#160;29
 2018&#160;that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors
 and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock (collectively
 the &#8220;Reporting Persons&#8221;)
 to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Based solely upon a review of Forms 3
 4 and 5 and amendments thereto filed electronically with the SEC by the Reporting Persons with respect to the fiscal year ended December 29
 2018
 we believe that all filing requirements were complied with in a timely manner
 except in two instances where Form 4s were inadvertently filed late on behalf of two directors to report certain transactions as follows: (i) in April 2018
 to report three purchases of shares that were executed by the broker of one of our former directors
 Mackey McDonald
 on Mr. McDonald&#8217;s behalf without his knowledge or direction; and (ii) in June 2019
The Board established the Audit Committee in accordance with Section&#160;3(a)(58)(A) and Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. The Audit Committee consists entirely of independent directors
 and each director meets the independence requirements set forth in the listing standards of Nasdaq
 Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and the Audit Committee charter. The Board has determined that each Audit Committee member is able to read and understand fundamental financial statements. In addition
Effective June 5
 2019
 the Board established the Operations and Strategy Committee to assist it in overseeing and facilitating the development and implementation of our ongoing operations and corporate strategy. The Operations and Strategy Committee is led by John Cahill
 Vice Chairman of the Board
 and meets with management regularly to discuss
 review and evaluate the development and implementation of our operational objectives and corporate strategy. The Operations and Strategy Committee is comprised of five directors appointed by the Board
 based on nominations recommended to the Board by our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Based on its review
 the committee shares with management the Board&#8217;s expectations for the operations of the company and strategic planning process
 makes recommendations to management on areas of improvement
 and provides other feedback and guidance to management on behalf of the Board. The Operations and Strategy Committee&#8217;s responsibilities also include
 among others
our corporate strategy
 performance
 and annual capital plan
the impact of external developments and factors
 such as any changes in economic and market conditions
 competition in the industry
 environmental and safety regulations
 federal
 state and local regulations and technology
identification of prospects and opportunities for corporate developments and growth initiatives
 including acquisitions
 divestitures
implementation of our corporate strategy through corporate developments and growth initiatives
 including acquisitions
 divestitures
The Board has determined that all of the directors who served on the Compensation Committee during fiscal year 2018 are independent within the meaning of the Nasdaq listing standards. No member of the Compensation Committee is a current
 or during fiscal year 2018 was
 a former
 officer
 or employee of Heinz
 Kraft
 Kraft Heinz
 or any of their subsidiaries. During fiscal year 2018
 no member of the Compensation Committee had a relationship that must be described under the SEC rules relating to disclosure of &#8220;related person transactions&#8221; (for a description of our policy on &#8220;related person transactions
in Item 13
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
). During fiscal year 2018
Annually
 the Compensation Committee evaluates the risk profile of our executive and broad-based employee compensation programs. In its evaluation for fiscal year 2018
 the Compensation Committee reviewed our executive compensation structure as well as our overarching compensation systems to determine whether our compensation policies and practices encourage our executive officers or other employees to take unnecessary or excessive risks and whether these policies and practices properly mitigate risk. In addition
As described under &#8220;Compensation Discussion and Analysis
&#8221; our compensation structure is designed to incentivize executives and employees to achieve Kraft Heinz financial and strategic goals as well as individual performance goals that promote long-term stockholder returns. However
 certain employees within our procurement organization engaged in misconduct and circumvented controls that included withholding information or directing others to withhold information related to supplier contracts that affected the accounting for certain supplier rebates
 incentives
 and pricing arrangements
 in an attempt to influence the achievement of internal financial targets that became or were perceived to have become increasingly difficult to attain due to changes in our business environment. We are undertaking various remedial efforts outlined in Item 9A
 
 and expect to revise the Performance Bonus Plan for 2019 to explicitly state applicable penalties such as score and/or percentage reductions and losses
 up to and including ineligibility for and forfeiture of payments under the Performance Bonus Plan for misconduct. We also expect to revise the Performance Bonus Plan for 2019 to require that if the aforementioned misconduct is discovered after the payout under the Performance Bonus Plan
 we would be entitled to seek equitable relief to recoup the amounts paid
 including without limitation disgorgement
The Compensation Committee oversees our compensation programs on behalf of the Board. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities
 the Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In reliance on that review and discussion

Non-employee directors are awarded Kraft Heinz deferred shares. Although the deferred shares are vested as of the award date
 the shares are not distributed until six months following the date the non-employee director ceases to serve on our Board. When dividends are paid on our common stock
Our stock ownership guidelines require non-employee directors who elect to receive compensation for service as directors to hold shares of our common stock in an amount equal to five times the annual Board retainer (equivalent to $550
000) within five years. As all of our current directors have served following the 2015 Merger for less than five years

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis
 which we refer to as the &#8220;CD&amp;A&#8221;
 outlines the compensation philosophy and objectives of Kraft Heinz and describes our executive pay programs for fiscal year 2018 and
 specifically
Senior Vice President
Enabling us to attract
 retain
Consistent with these goals and as described in further detail below
As noted above
 our compensation program is based on a pay-for-performance philosophy. This section of the CD&amp;A provides an overview of each element of our compensation program and describes both the process for determining such compensation and how such compensation relates to Kraft Heinz&#8217;s pay-for-performance philosophy and meritocratic principles. The following table summarizes the primary elements and objectives of our 2018 compensation program for executive officers
Ongoing cash compensation based on the executive officer&#8217;s role and responsibilities
 individual job performance
Annual incentive with target award amounts for each executive officer. Actual cash payouts are linked to achievement of annual Company goals and individual performance. For fiscal year 2018
Awards that are linked to achievement of multi-year profitability goals. The PSUs pay out in Kraft Heinz common stock after five years
Base salary is the principal &#8220;fixed&#8221; element of executive compensation at Kraft Heinz and for our NEOs. The Committee believes that it is important that each NEO receive a competitive marketplace base salary to provide an appropriate balance between fixed and variable compensation. The initial base salary of each NEO is established in connection with the hiring of such NEO. In establishing base salaries
 Kraft Heinz reviews market-based survey data published by the Hay Group and select country-specific surveys
 in each case
. On occasion
 Kraft Heinz may review and adjust an executive&#8217;s base salary during the course of the year to account for increased responsibilities
 roles
 and other factors. The Committee has sole responsibility for the review of Mr.&#160;Hees&#8217;s compensation. Mr.&#160;Hees has primary responsibility for the review of the compensation of his direct reports
 including the other NEOs

Mr. Oliveira&#8217;s base salary is paid in British pounds. The amount shown in the table above is based on the following 12-month average exchange rate of 0.7499 USD/GBP. Mr. Oliveira&#8217;s base salary was increased effective January 1
Ms. La Lande was hired on January 22
We believe that the base salary review process serves our pay-for-performance philosophy
 because base pay increases are generally merit-based and dependent on the NEO&#8217;s success and achievement in his or her role. In addition
 each NEO&#8217;s target annual incentive award opportunity
 as described below
 is based on a percentage of his or her base salary. Therefore
 as NEOs earn merit-based salary increases
The Performance Bonus Plan (the &#8220;PBP&#8221;) is designed to motivate and reward employees who contribute positively toward our business strategy and achieve their individual performance objectives. For 2018
Due to the difficult operating environment in 2018 and the Company&#8217;s financial performance
 Messrs. Hees
 Knopf
 and Basilio asked to forfeit their rights to the amounts payable pursuant to the PBP with respect to fiscal year 2018
For a description of our NEOs&#8217; base salaries
 please see &#8220;Base Salary&#8221; above. Because Ms. La Lande was hired on January 22
 2018
Each NEO is granted a target award opportunity prior to the beginning of each year
 which is set as a percentage of the NEO&#8217;s annual base salary: 300% for Mr. Hees
 175% for Mr. Knopf
 250% for Mr. Basilio
 175% for Mr. Oliveira
 and 150% for Ms. La Lande. Due to the nature of Mr. Hees&#8217;s role and responsibilities and the significant nature of Mr. Basilio&#8217;s role as President of our largest business
 their respective Target Award Opportunities were greater than the other NEOs
 although
 as noted above
 due to the difficult operating environment in 2018 and the Company&#8217;s financial performance
 Messrs. Hees
 Knopf
 and Basilio asked to forfeit their rights to the amounts payable pursuant to the PBP with respect to fiscal year 2018
Another component of a participant&#8217;s PBP calculation is the Company&#8217;s (or the relevant Zone&#8217;s or business unit&#8217;s) financial performance (&#8220;Financial Multiplier&#8221;). For 2018
 the Financial Multiplier was initially designed to be based on Adjusted EBITDA performance and could have ranged from 0% to 150%
 with performance between threshold and maximum levels resulting in a payout between 50% and 150%
 and with performance below threshold resulting in no payout. In June 2018
 our management team established a revised business plan for the second half of the 2018 fiscal year (the &#8220;2H Plan&#8221;). The 2H Plan was intended to drive net sales (&#8220;NSV&#8221;) growth by regaining distribution and building velocity to position the Company for long-term financial health and success. In June 2018
 in order to (i) capture overall commercial
 operational
 and financial performance of the Company and (ii) incentivize management to deliver the 2H Plan to position the Company for long-term financial health and success
 the Committee exercised its discretion under the PBP to include NSV and Adjusted Net Income as elements of the Financial Multiplier as described below. A participant&#8217;s final Financial Multiplier was calculated based on the metrics aligned to the 2H Plan. As described above
 Messrs. Hees
 Knopf
 and Basilio forfeited their respective rights to the amounts payable pursuant to the PBP for 2018. For Mr. Oliveira and Ms. La Lande
For 2018
 for participants evaluated based on global performance
 including Messrs. Hees and Knopf and Ms. La Lande
 the Financial Multiplier was calculated based on global change in Adjusted Net Income. If performance resulted between the threshold and maximum levels for Adjusted Net Income
 the component multiplier would have ranged from 60% to 100%. If the threshold had not been met
For participants evaluated based on Zone (operating segment) or business unit performance
 including Messrs. Basilio and Oliveira
 who were evaluated based on U.S. and EMEA Zone performance
 respectively
 the Financial Multiplier was calculated based 30% on global change in Adjusted Net Income and 70% based on their respective Zone or business unit financial performances. Zone and business unit financial performance was based 75% on change in NSV and 25% on change in Segment Adjusted EBITDA. If performance resulted between the threshold and target levels for NSV
 the component multiplier would have ranged from 60% to 100%
 depending on the Zone. If performance resulted between the threshold and maximum levels for Segment Adjusted EBITDA
 the component multiplier would have ranged from 60% to 130%. For all cases
 if the threshold had not been met
*Growth rates reflect budget foreign exchange rates and exclude the impacts of (i) our Venezuelan subsidiary
 due to the highly inflationary environment
 (ii) our 50.1% interest in our South African subsidiary
 which was sold in May 2018
 and (iii) with respect to NSV
 fluctuations for dairy commodities that impact pricing terms under related contracts. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income/(loss) excluding
 when they occur
 the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses
 deal costs
 unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges
 impairment losses
 losses/(gains) on the sale of a business
 other losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures (e.g.
 tax and hedging impacts)
 nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g.
 remeasurement gains and losses)
 and U.S. Tax Reform discrete income tax expense/(benefit)
 and including
 when they occur
 adjustments to reflect preferred stock dividend payments on an accrual basis. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense
 other expense/(income)
 net
 provision for/(benefit from) income taxes
 and depreciation and amortization (excluding integration and restructuring expenses); in addition to these adjustments
 we exclude
 when they occur
 the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses
 deal costs
 unrealized gains/(losses) on commodity hedges (the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized; once realized
 the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment&#8217;s operating results)
 impairment losses
 gains/(losses) on the sale of a business
 other gains/(losses) related to acquisitions and divestitures (e.g.
 tax and hedging impacts)
 nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g.
 remeasurement gains and losses)
When the Committee certified the achievement of performance with respect to Adjusted Net Income performance
 fiscal year 2018 consolidated financial statements were still being prepared. Given the immateriality of any anticipated adjustments
 the Committee certified and approved performance at a maximum level of 64%
When the Committee certified performance with respect to EMEA Segment Adjusted EBITDA performance
In 2018
 all NEOs exceeded threshold on their Individual Rating and Financial Multiplier components of the PBP calculation. The Committee granted certain members of management discretion to increase or decrease the final PBP payouts of the other NEOs with up to a 20% variance compared to the amounts as calculated based on the Base Salaries
 Target Awards
 Individual Ratings
 and Financial Multipliers described above. Had they not forfeited their rights to the payment
 Mr. Hees would have earned a PBP payout of $1

 and Mr. Oliveira and Ms. La Lande did receive
The foundation of each participant&#8217;s Individual Rating is our MBO process. At the beginning of each year
 the Committee establishes a series of performance goals
 or MBOs
 that are established based on the Company&#8217;s corporate strategy
 and performance goals are then &#8220;cascaded&#8221; throughout the organization. First
 the Committee establishes MBOs for Mr. Hees. Then
 in consultation with the Committee
 Mr. Hees establishes corresponding MBOs for each of his direct reports
 including the other NEOs. His direct reports
 in turn
Each NEO has an MBO comprised of multiple goals or objectives. For each goal
 there are one or more &#8220;Key Performance Indicators
Bernardo Hees: Mr. Hees had three MBO goals. These were: (i) &#8220;Deliver Kraft Heinz Financial Results&#8221;
 which was evaluated based on Kraft Heinz&#8217;s financial performance in NSV and Adjusted Net Income
 (ii) &#8220;Strengthen Innovation and Develop Digital Strategy/Go-to-Market&#8221;
 which was evaluated based on the innovation pipeline for 2019 and 2020 and E-commerce and digital innovation
 and (iii) &#8220;Deliver New Projects to Sustain the Business&#8221;
 which was evaluated based on the supply chain planning system and business expansion. Based on Mr. Hees&#8217;s performance
David Knopf: Mr. Knopf had three MBO goals. These were (i) &#8220;Deliver Kraft Heinz Financial Results&#8221;
 which was evaluated based on Kraft Heinz&#8217;s financial performance in Adjusted Net Income and operating free cash flow
 (ii) &#8220;Increase KHC Financial Efficiency&#8221;
 which was evaluated based on tax performance compared to budget and project-specific goals
 and (iii) &#8220;Deliver New Projects to Sustain the Business&#8221;
 which was evaluated based on business expansion and project-specific goals. Based on Mr. Knopf's performance
Paulo Basilio: Mr. Basilio had three MBO goals. These were (i) &#8220;Deliver Kraft Heinz Results&#8221;
 which was evaluated based on case fill rates and U.S. financial performance in contribution margin and NSV
 (ii) &#8220;Ensure Successful Marketing and Robust R&amp;D Pipeline
&#8221; which was evaluated based on market share and the innovation pipeline for 2019 in the U.S. Zone
 and (iii) &#8220;Deliver New Projects to Foster the Business&#8221;
 which was evaluated based on initiatives relating to Kraft Heinz&#8217;s Springboard platform. Based on Mr. Basilio&#8217;s performance
Rafael Oliveira: Mr. Oliveira had three MBO goals. These were (i) &#8220;Deliver Kraft Heinz EMEA Financial Results
&#8221; which was evaluated based on EMEA financial performance in contribution margin and NSV
 (ii) &#8220;Ensure Successful Marketing and Robust R&amp;D Pipeline
&#8221; which was evaluated based on market share and the innovation pipeline for 2019 in the EMEA Zone
 and (iii) &#8220;Deliver New Projects to Foster the Business
&#8221; which was evaluated based on foodservice growth in EMEA and NSV growth in MEA. Based on Mr. Oliveira&#8217;s performance
Rashida La Lande: Ms. La Lande had three MBO goals. These were (i) &#8220;Deliver Effective and Efficient Legal Services
&#8221; which was evaluated based on project-specific goals and legal victories
 financial and EBITDA partnerships with the business
 and legal victories from ongoing litigation
 (ii) &#8220;Protect and Promote our Innovations and Brands
&#8221; which was evaluated based on Board projects and crisis management design and preparation for the U.S. and Canada
 and (iii) &#8220;Ethics and Compliance&#8221; which was evaluated based on the Company&#8217;s ethics and compliance initiatives worldwide. Based on Ms. La Lande&#8217;s performance
As part of its commitment to fostering an ownership mentality
 Kraft Heinz permits certain employees to participate in an annual bonus swap program (the &#8220;Bonus Swap Program&#8221;). Under the Bonus Swap Program
 eligible employees can elect to invest a portion of their annual PBP payout in our common stock (we refer to these purchased shares as &#8220;Investment Shares&#8221;) and leverage that investment through the issuance of matching RSUs (we refer to these RSUs as &#8220;Matching RSUs&#8221;). The Matching RSUs cliff vest on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant subject to continued employment and the retention of the Investment Shares as described below. To participate in the Bonus Swap Program
 eligible employees can elect to use 0%
 25% or 50% of their calculated net bonus (after deducting an amount based on a normalized tax rate depending on country of residence) to purchase Investment Shares. The number of Investment Shares purchased is calculated as the product of the calculated net bonus and the swap election percentage
In 2018
 only Mr. Oliveira participated in the Bonus Swap Program
 as he was the only NEO to receive a PBP bonus payment related to 2017. The following table sets forth
 for Mr. Oliveira
 the portion of his fiscal 2017 bonus used to purchase Investment Shares (the &#8220;Conversion Amount&#8221;)

Under our Bonus Swap Program
 so long as the Matching RSUs remain unvested
 if an employee transfers any of the related Investment Shares
 he or she immediately forfeits a proportional amount of the corresponding Matching RSUs. The Committee believes that the Bonus Swap Program as a whole and the forfeitability of the Matching RSUs in particular
 strongly motivates eligible employees to hold Kraft Heinz common stock for the long-term
 further emphasizing a long-term view in creating stockholder value. Prior to 2016
From time to time
 we may make discretionary equity awards to employees. Historically
 these discretionary awards have been made in the form of stock options. These stock options are granted with an exercise price based on the fair market value of a Kraft Heinz share on the grant date and cliff vest after a five-year period. In 2018
 the Committee approved discretionary option awards of 44
850 stock options to Mr. Knopf and 52
325 stock options to Ms. La Lande in order to continue to align a portion of their long-term incentive compensation directly with stockholders&#8217; interests. The options have an exercise price of $66.89 and will cliff vest on March 1
 2023
In March 2018
 the Company issued additional PSUs to a limited number of employees deemed key to achievement of our long-term goals
 including all of our NEOs
 in order to place a significant portion of their compensation at risk if performance goals are not achieved. These PSUs could be earned over a three-year performance period based on Kraft Heinz&#8217;s achievement of financial performance metrics based on Adjusted EBITDA for the period beginning in January 2018 and ending at the end of December 2020. Once earned
 to promote retention of key talent
 the PSUs will remain subject to a continued service requirement through March 1
As of December 29
 2018
 due to the performance of our business
In March 2018
 in order to further retain and motivate top talent and align the interests of management with those of the Company&#8217;s stockholders
 the Company also issued RSUs
 separately from the Bonus Swap Program
 to a limited number of employees deemed key to achievement of our long-term goals
 including all of our NEOs. These RSUs will cliff vest on March 1
 2023
Additional information about the stock option
 PSU
In addition to base salary
 our PBP
 and long-term equity grants
 we provided and continue to provide certain executive benefit programs to our NEOs. Kraft Heinz maintains defined contribution retirement plans to allow employees to save for retirement in a tax-efficient manner. These plans are broadly available to eligible employees and do not discriminate in favor of the NEOs or other members of senior management. None of the NEOs participate in any defined benefit pension plans
 non-qualified deferred compensation plans
Kraft Heinz also provides health and welfare insurance benefits to employees
 including the NEOs. These benefits include life
 disability
From time to time
 Kraft Heinz provides limited perquisite benefits. For example
 we provide limited tax advisory services
 immigration benefits
 and reimbursement of certain relocation expenses for business reasons. Kraft Heinz provides other limited perquisite benefits
Our compensation programs promote a strong alignment of the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders. For example
 in order to participate in our Bonus Swap Program
 each participant must use a significant portion of his or her bonus to purchase our common stock. In 2016
 we adopted minimum stock ownership guidelines
 which require our NEOs to attain levels of beneficial stock ownership measured based on a multiple of his or her annual base salary
The stock ownership guidelines require NEOs to attain levels of beneficial stock ownership within five years from the later of December 8
 2016 and the date of the NEO&#8217;s appointment to a position subject to the guidelines. For more details on the stock ownership of our NEOs
Clawback
Our stock option
 PSU
 and RSU award agreements provide that
 in certain circumstances
 the award and any proceeds or other benefits a participant may receive may be subject to forfeiture and/or repayment to Kraft Heinz to the extent required to comply with any requirements imposed under applicable laws and/or the rules. Further
 if a participant receives any amount in excess of what he or she should have received under the terms of the award for any reason (including without limitation by reason of a financial restatement
 mistake in calculations
 or administrative error)
 all as determined by the Committee
 then he or she will be required to promptly repay any such excess amount to Kraft Heinz. Our insider trading policy also limits the timing and types of transactions in Kraft Heinz securities by executive officers
 including our NEOs. Among other restrictions
 the policy prohibits holding Kraft Heinz securities in a margin account or pledging Kraft Heinz securities as collateral for a loan without advance written notice to the Corporate Secretary. In addition
 the policy prohibits short-selling Kraft Heinz securities
 transacting in puts
 calls
 or other derivatives on Kraft Heinz securities
When determining total direct compensation packages
 the Committee considers all factors that may have an impact on our financial performance
 including tax and accounting rules and regulations under Section 162(m) of the Code. Section 162(m) of the Code generally limits our ability to deduct compensation paid to &#8220;covered employees&#8221; (as defined in the Code) to the extent such compensation exceeds $1 million to such employee in any fiscal year. For taxable years beginning prior to January 1
 2018
 there was a performance-based exception to this rule that permitted us to deduct compensation that met certain qualifying performance-based criteria. This performance-based exception no longer applies for taxable years beginning after December 31
 2017
 such that compensation paid to our &#8220;covered employees&#8221; in excess of $1 million will not be deductible unless it qualifies for limited transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2
Despite the Committee&#8217;s intentions to structure the Company&#8217;s incentive programs for taxable years commencing prior to January 1
 2018 in a manner intended to be exempt from the deduction limitations of Section 162(m)
 there can be no assurance that we will be able to take advantage of the limited transition relief and satisfy the requirements for such exemption. Further

To supplement the SEC-required disclosure in the other columns of the 2018 Summary Compensation Table
 we have included this additional column
 which shows &#8220;Total Compensation as Adjusted from SEC Rules&#8221; representing the portion of the &#8220;Total Compensation&#8221; available to each NEO in each of the years shown. We are presenting this supplemental column to show how the Committee views the NEOs&#8217; compensation for each of the years shown. The &#8220;Total Compensation&#8221; column as calculated under SEC rules includes several items that are not necessarily reflective of compensation available to the NEOs in a particular year. Amounts reported in the &#8220;Total Compensation as Adjusted from SEC Rules&#8221; column differ substantially from the amounts determined under SEC rules as reported in the &#8220;Total Compensation&#8221; column. &#8220;Total Compensation as Adjusted from SEC Rules&#8221; is not a substitute for &#8220;Total Compensation.&#8221; &#8220;Total Compensation as Adjusted from SEC Rules&#8221; represents: (1)&#160;&#8220;Total Compensation
&#8221; as calculated under applicable SEC rules
 minus (2)&#160;the aggregate grant date fair value of equity awards (as reflected in the &#8220;Stock Awards&#8221; and &#8220;Option Awards&#8221; columns)
 and plus (3)&#160;the value realized from any exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs or PSUs before payment of any applicable withholding taxes and brokerage commissions (as reflected in the Option Exercises and Stock Vested tables of the proxy statements for the respective years)
 including the value realized from the payment of any dividend equivalents. In addition
 &#8220;Total Compensation as Adjusted from SEC Rules&#8221; reflects any bonus paid in each of the years shown
The following table sets forth information regarding the grant of plan-based awards for each of the NEOs in 2018. As described in the CD&amp;A

Generally
 Kraft Heinz provides for severance benefits to U.S.-based salaried employees
 including our U.S.-based NEOs
 pursuant to the terms of the U.S. Severance Pay Plan. The severance benefits for non-U.S.-based salaried employees are made pursuant to the local laws and regulations governing the jurisdiction in which they work
 subject to adjustment at the discretion of Kraft Heinz for employees at certain organizational levels (such benefits
 together with the U.S. Severance Pay Plan
NEOs are eligible for severance benefits under the Severance Pay Plan upon an involuntary termination of employment
 such as job elimination
 location closing
Pursuant to the U.S. Severance Pay Plan
 Messrs. Hees
 Basilio
 and Knopf and Ms. La Lande would generally be eligible to receive a severance payment equal to 12 months of base salary upon the execution of a release of claims against Kraft Heinz. In addition
 the Committee may
 in its sole discretion
 authorize payment of additional severance in respect of a participant&#8217;s annual bonus opportunity. Although Mr. Oliveira is not based in the U.S. and not otherwise covered by the U.S. Severance Pay Plan
 the Company has determined that he is eligible to receive the same benefits as the other NEOs. Severance payments are generally made in a cash lump-sum
On April 22
 2019
 Kraft Heinz announced that Mr. Hees would leave Kraft Heinz in 2019.&#160;On June 5
 2019
 the Committee approved the following severance terms for Mr. Hees
 which will become payable following Mr. Hees&#8217;s termination of employment and subject to his execution of a release of claims against Kraft Heinz: (1) a severance payment equal to 12 months of base salary
 and (2) a pro-rata payment of his annual bonus under the PBP assuming performance at 85%

 the &#8220;Financial Multiplier&#8221;) and Mr. Hees&#8217;s MBOs (i.e.

 the stock options granted to the NEOs would vest as if 20% of the shares vested on each annual anniversary date of the specific grant
 and for all other terminations and for voluntary resignations
 the unvested stock options would be forfeited. In addition
 as of the last day of 2018
 beginning on the termination date
 the exercise period was 90 days for termination without cause and one year for retirement
 death
 and disability. In April 2019
 the Committee modified award agreements for outstanding equity awards (options
 PSUs
 Matching RSUs
 and RSUs) with respect to the treatment upon a termination due to death
 disability
 or retirement. Such terminations
 for option awards on or after the first anniversary of the specific grant date
 and for RSU and Matching RSU awards on or after the anniversary deadlines outlined in the award agreements
 would result in such awards being fully vested and exercisable
 in the case of PSUs
 to the extent the performance conditions had been satisfied. In addition
In accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K
 promulgated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act and Consumer Protection Act of 2010
For purposes of reporting annual total compensation and the ratio of annual total compensation of the CEO to the median employee
Pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto
 because there has been no significant change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we reasonably believe would result in a significant change to our pay ratio disclosure
To identify our median employee last year
 we determined the annual total compensation by examining the 2017 annualized base salaries plus target incentive bonus for all individuals
 excluding our Chief Executive Officer
 who were employed by us as of December 1
 2017. In accordance with Item 402(u) and instructions thereto
 we included all full-time
 part-time
 temporary
 and seasonal employees worldwide. We believe the use of base salaries plus target incentive bonus for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure
After applying the methodology described above
 our median employee compensation using the Summary Compensation Table requirements was $47
612. Our CEO&#8217;s compensation in the Summary Compensation Table was $29
047
768. Therefore
 our CEO to median employee pay ratio (&#8220;CEO pay ratio&#8221;)
 a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u)
 is 610:1. The CEO&#8217;s total compensation of $29
047
768 included $1
060
000 payable pursuant to the PBP for 2018
 as well as $17
838
582 related to the grant date fair value of PSUs. As noted above
 Mr. Hees has decided to forfeit the PBP for 2018
 and as of December 29
 2018
 the expected payout of those PSUs was determined to be zero based on the probability of future achievement of performance metrics. If we had excluded the PBP payout for 2018 and the March 2018 PSUs from total CEO compensation

Item 13.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
The Guidelines require that a majority of the directors meet Nasdaq listing standards&#8217; &#8220;independence&#8221; requirements. For a director to be considered independent
 the Board must affirmatively determine
 after reviewing all relevant information
 that a director has no direct or indirect material relationship with Kraft Heinz that would interfere with his or her exercise of independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities as a director. The Board determined that
 under the Nasdaq listing standards
 the following director nominees are independent: Mr. Abel
 Mr. Behring
 Ms. Cool
 Mr. Dewan
 Ms. Jackson
 Mr. Lemann
 Mr. Pope
 Mr. Castro-Neves
 and Mr. Van Damme. Warren Buffett and Mackey McDonald
 who retired from Board service in 2018
 and Marcel Herrmann Telles
 who decided to retire from the Board
 effective on June 12
 2019
 were also determined to be independent during the periods they served. Mr. Cahill
 the former Chief Executive Officer of Kraft and a current consultant to Kraft Heinz
 and George Zoghbi
 our former Chief Operating Officer of the U.S. Commercial business and Special Advisor at Kraft Heinz
In conducting its evaluations of Mr. Abel
 Mr. Buffett
 and Ms. Cool
 the Board considered each individual&#8217;s affiliation with Berkshire Hathaway
&#32;of our outstanding common stock as of June 5
 2019
 and its subsidiaries. Similarly
 in conducting its evaluations of Mr. Behring
 Mr. Lemann
 Mr. Castro-Neves
 and Mr. Telles
 the Board considered each individual&#8217;s affiliation with 3G Capital
&#32;of our outstanding common stock as of June 5
 2019
 and its subsidiaries. The Board also considered the service of Messrs. Behring
 Castro-Neves
 and Van Damme on the Board of Directors of RBI
 a company in which 3G Capital invests and the parent company of Burger King and Tim Hortons
 quick service restaurant companies that purchase certain of our products and conduct certain brand sponsorship and marketing activities for us
The Board has adopted a written policy regarding the review
 approval
 or ratification of &#8220;related person transactions.&#8221; A &#8220;related person transaction&#8221; is one in which Kraft Heinz is a participant
 the amount involved exceeds $120
000
 and any &#8220;related person&#8221; had
 has
 or will have a direct or indirect material interest. In general
 &#8220;related persons&#8221; include our directors
 executive officers
 and 5% stockholders and their immediate family members. In accordance with this policy
 the Governance Committee reviews transactions that might qualify as &#8220;related person transactions.&#8221; If the Governance Committee determines that a transaction qualifies as a &#8220;related person transaction
&#8221; then the Governance Committee reviews
 and approves
 disapproves
 or ratifies the &#8220;related person transaction.&#8221; The Governance Committee approves or ratifies only those &#8220;related person transactions&#8221; that are fair and reasonable to Kraft Heinz and in our and our stockholders&#8217; best interests. Any member of the Governance Committee who is a &#8220;related person&#8221; with respect to a transaction under review may not participate in the deliberations or decisions regarding the transaction. The chair of the Governance Committee (or the Chair of the Audit Committee if the chair of the Governance Committee is a &#8220;related person&#8221; with respect to the transaction under review) will review and approve or ratify potential &#8220;related person transactions&#8221; when it is not practicable or desirable to delay review of a transaction until a Governance Committee meeting
 and will report to the Governance Committee any transaction so approved or ratified. The Governance Committee
 in the course of its review and approval or ratification of a related person transaction under this policy
 considers
whether the transaction may involve an actual
 or the appearance of a
In connection with the 2015 Merger
 we entered into a registration rights agreement with 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway. Pursuant to the registration rights agreement
 we granted 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway registration rights with respect to the shares of Kraft Heinz common stock held by 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway as of the date of the closing of the 2015 Merger
 representing shares of Kraft Heinz common stock acquired from Heinz in connection with the 2015 Merger and/or immediately prior to the 2015 Merger pursuant to a warrant. The registration rights only apply to registrable shares and not shares of Kraft Heinz common stock subsequently acquired by either party. These rights include demand registration rights
 shelf registration rights
 and &#8220;piggyback&#8221; registration rights
 as well as customary indemnification. The rights are subject to certain holdback and suspension periods. We generally will bear all fees
 costs
 and expenses related to registrations
 other than underwriting discounts and commissions attributable to the sale of shares of Kraft Heinz common stock by 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway
The registration rights agreement grants each of 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway demand registration rights. We will be required
 upon the written request of 3G Global Food Holdings or Berkshire Hathaway
 to file a registration statement pursuant to its demand rights under the registration rights agreement
 as promptly as practicable and to use our reasonable best efforts to effect registration of shares of Kraft Heinz common stock requested to be registered by 3G Global Food Holdings or Berkshire Hathaway
The registration rights agreement also grants each of 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway shelf registration rights. Subject to our eligibility to use a Registration Statement on Form&#160;S-3
 each of 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway may request that we file a shelf registration statement with respect to some or all of its shares of Kraft Heinz common stock
 and
 upon such request
 we are required to file such registration statement promptly as practicable
The registration rights agreement grants each of 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway &#8220;piggyback&#8221; registration rights. If we register any of our shares of common stock
 either for our own account or for the account of other stockholders
 each of 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway will be entitled
 subject to certain exceptions
Notwithstanding the registration rights described above
 if there is an offering of shares of Kraft Heinz and the managing underwriters for the offering advise us that a public sale or distribution of shares outside the offering would adversely affect the offering
 then
 if requested
 each of 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway will not dispose of
 or request the registration of
 any registrable shares for a certain period
 which we refer to as a holdback period. The holdback period will begin on the 10th day before the pricing date of the offering and extend for either (i)&#160;120 days or (ii)&#160;an earlier date
In addition
 we may delay or suspend the filing
 effectiveness
 or use of a registration statement for a certain period
 which we refer to as a suspension period
 if we determine that (i)&#160;proceeding with the use or effectiveness of the registration statement would require us to disclose material non-public information and the disclosure of that information at that time would not be in our best interests or (ii)&#160;the registration or offering to be delayed or suspended would
 if not delayed or suspended
 materially adversely affect us or delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the success of any pending or proposed material transaction
 including any debt or equity financing
 any acquisition or disposition
 any recapitalization or reorganization or any other material transaction
 whether due to commercial reasons
 a desire to avoid premature disclosure of information
 or any other reason. During any calendar year
In connection with the 2015 Merger
 3G Global Food Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway entered into a shareholders&#8217; agreement that governs how each party and their affiliates will vote the shares of Kraft Heinz common stock held by them as of the date of closing of the 2015 Merger
 with respect to supporting certain directors who are designated by either 3G Global Food Holdings or Berkshire Hathaway. Pursuant to the shareholders&#8217; agreement
 3G Global Food Holdings agrees that for so long as Berkshire Hathaway and its affiliates control shares representing at least 66% of the voting power in election of directors of shares owned by Berkshire Hathaway as of the consummation of the 2015 Merger
 3G Global Food Holdings and its affiliates will vote their shares of Kraft Heinz common stock in favor of the three Kraft Heinz Board nominees designated by Berkshire Hathaway and not take any action to remove such designees without Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s consent. Similarly
 Berkshire Hathaway agrees that for so long as 3G Global Food Holdings and its affiliates control shares representing at least 66% of the voting power in elections of directors of shares owned by 3G Global Food Holdings as of the consummation of the 2015 Merger

On November 2
 2017
 we entered into a consulting agreement with Mr.&#160;Cahill pursuant to which he provides advisory and consulting services to us related to current and historical finances
 relationships with licensors
 customers and vendors
 employee matters
 product development
 marketing and distribution
 government affairs and strategic opportunities. Mr. Cahill is paid $500
000 annually under this new consulting agreement
 which was approved by the disinterested members of the Board. Mr.&#160;Cahill&#8217;s services under the consulting agreement are distinct from his duties as a director. Previously
 Mr. Cahill had provided similar services under a consulting agreement entered into following the 2015 Merger
Effective January 1
 2017
 the Company entered into an offer letter (the &#8220;Offer Letter&#8221;) with Mr. Zoghbi in order to incent Mr. Zoghbi to extend his service with the Company past January 1
 2017
 after a retention bonus pursuant to a prior offer letter entered into upon the closing of the 2015 Merger had been earned. Under the Offer Letter
 Mr. Zoghbi: (i) continued his current base salary of $850
000; (ii) agreed to a 2017 target annual incentive award opportunity of 200% (with a maximum bonus multiplier of 130%); and (iii) was granted a long-term equity incentive award. The long-term equity incentive award was composed of (i) RSUs
 which cliff vest after three years
 and (ii) PSUs

The following description is a summary that is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Kraft Heinz&#8217;s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
Kraft Heinz is authorized to issue five billion (5
000
000
000) shares of common stock
 par value $0.01 per share
 and nine hundred twenty thousand (920
000) shares of preferred stock
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the Certificate of Incorporation
 Kraft Heinz may issue preferred stock in one or more series
 with preferences
 limitations and rights as authorized by Kraft Heinz&#8217;s board of directors
 to the extent permitted by Delaware law. The powers (including voting
 if any)
 preferences and relative
 participating
 optional and other special rights of each series of preferred stock
 and the qualifications
 limitations or restrictions thereof
 if any
 may differ from those of any and all other classes and series of preferred stock at any time outstanding. The issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect the rights of Kraft Heinz&#8217;s common shareholders by
As a result of these or other factors
 the issuance of preferred stock could have an adverse impact on the market price of Kraft Heinz&#8217;s common stock.  Kraft Heinz&#8217;s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and trades under the ticker symbol &#8220;KHC.&#8221; All outstanding shares of common stock are validly issued
Subject to the preferences applicable to any shares of preferred stock outstanding at any time
 holders of Kraft Heinz&#8217;s common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by its board of directors from assets or funds legally available therefore. The timing
 declaration
 amount and payment of future dividends will depend on Kraft Heinz&#8217;s financial condition
 earnings
 capital requirements and debt service obligations
 as well as legal requirements
 regulatory constraints
 industry practice and other factors that Kraft Heinz&#8217;s board of directors deems relevant. Kraft Heinz&#8217;s board of directors will make all decisions regarding the payment of dividends from time to time in accordance with applicable law. Subject to any preferential liquidation rights of holders of preferred stock that may be outstanding
 upon Kraft Heinz&#8217;s dissolution
Each share of common stock outstanding is entitled to one vote on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote. However
 except as required by law
holders of such affected class or series are entitled
 either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such class or series
The By-Laws provide that
 except as required by law
 the Certificate of Incorporation or the rules of any stock exchange upon which Kraft Heinz&#8217;s capital stock is listed
 all corporate actions to be taken by vote of the shareholders shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders entitled to vote thereon who are present in person or represented by proxy
 and where a separate vote by class or series is required
&#160;The Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws contain provisions that are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of the board of directors and that could make it more difficult to acquire control of the company by means of a tender offer
 open market purchases
&#160;Under Delaware law
&#160;We believe that the availability of the preferred stock under the Certificate of Incorporation provides the company with flexibility in addressing corporate issues that may arise. Having these authorized shares available for issuance will allow the company to issue shares of preferred stock without the expense and delay of a special shareholders&#8217; meeting. The authorized shares of preferred stock
 as well as shares of common stock
 will be available for issuance without further action by the company&#8217;s shareholders
 with the exception of any actions required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange on which Kraft Heinz&#8217;s securities may be listed. The board of directors will have the power
 subject to applicable law
 to issue classes or series of preferred stock that could
 depending on the terms of the class or series
 impede the completion of a merger
&#160;The Certificate of Incorporation provides that any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders of Kraft Heinz may be taken without a meeting
 without prior notice and without a vote if a consent or consents in writing
 setting forth the action so taken
 are signed by the holders of outstanding capital stock of Kraft Heinz having not less than the minimum number of votes necessary to authorize such action at a meeting at which all shares of capital stock entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]





On July 2
 2015
 through a series of transactions
 we consummated the merger of Kraft Foods Group
 Inc. (&#8220;Kraft&#8221;) with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (&#8220;Heinz&#8221;) (the &#8220;2015 Merger&#8221;). At the closing of the 2015 Merger
 (&#8220;Kraft Heinz&#8221;). Before the consummation of the 2015 Merger
 Heinz was controlled by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and 3G Global Food Holdings
 LP (&#8220;3G Global Food Holdings&#8221; and together with its affiliates
 &#8220;3G Capital&#8221;)
 following their acquisition of H. J. Heinz Company on June 7
The consolidated financial statements include Kraft Heinz
 reportable segments defined by geographic region: United States
 Canada
Europe
 Middle East
Our segments reflect a change
 effective in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018
Asia Pacific
 Middle East
operating segment into the historical Europe reportable segment
 See Note 22
 
In the fourth quarter of 2018
 we announced our plans to divest certain assets and operations
December&#160;29
 2018
 we have classified the assets and liabilities related to these disposal groups as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets. These assets and liabilities are included in assets held for sale within current assets and liabilities held for sale within current liabilities. See Note 5
 
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;)
 which requires us to make accounting policy elections
 estimates
 and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets
 liabilities
 reserves
 and expenses. These policy elections
 estimates
 and assumptions are based on our best estimates and judgments. We evaluate our policy elections
 estimates
 and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors
 including the current economic environment. We believe these estimates to be reasonable given the current facts available. We adjust our policy elections
 estimates
 and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Market volatility
 including foreign currency exchange rates
 increases the uncertainty inherent in our estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision
 actual results could differ significantly from estimates. If actual amounts differ from estimates
 we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known. Historically
 the aggregate differences
 if any
 between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.







The entire disclosure for the basis of accounting
 or basis of presentation
 used to prepare the financial statements (for example
 US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
 Other Comprehensive Basis of Accounting
 IFRS).

We have restated herein our audited consolidated financial statements at December 30
 2017 and for the years ended December 30
 2017 and December 31
As previously disclosed on February 21
 2019
related to our procurement area
 specifically the accounting policies
 procedures
 and internal controls related to our procurement function
 including
 but not limited to
 agreements
 side agreements
 and changes or modifications to agreements with our suppliers. Following the receipt of this subpoena
 we
 together with external counsel and forensic accountants
 and subsequently
 under the oversight of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (the &#8220;Audit Committee&#8221;)
 conducted an internal investigation into the procurement area and related matters. As a result of the findings from this internal investigation
 which is now complete and which identified that multiple employees in the procurement area engaged in misconduct
In connection with the internal investigation
 we also conducted a comprehensive review of supplier contracts and related arrangements to identify other potential misstatements in the timing of the recognition of supplier rebates
 incentive payments
 and pricing arrangements. The review identified further misstatements
 which we also investigated and have been unable to conclude if they resulted from the misconduct described above. 
 relating to the periods up through September 29
 for fiscal year 2018
 for fiscal year 2017
 for fiscal year 2016
We do not believe that the misstatements are quantitatively material to any period presented in our prior financial statements. However
 due to the qualitative nature of the matters identified in our internal investigation
 including the number of years over which the misconduct occurred and the number of transactions
 suppliers
 and procurement employees involved
Accordingly
 we have restated herein our consolidated financial statements at December 30
 2017 and for the fiscal years ended December 30
 2017 and December 31
 2016
 in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 250
In addition to the misstatements related to the supplier contracts and related arrangements
 including the misstatements related to lease classification
 we corrected additional identified out-of-period and uncorrected misstatements that were not material
 individually or in the aggregate
These misstatements were related to customer incentive program expense misclassifications
 balance sheet misclassifications
 income taxes
 impairments
 and other misstatements

 is included in Note 23
In connection with the internal investigation
 we also conducted a comprehensive review of supplier contracts and related arrangements to identify other potential misstatements in the timing of the recognition of supplier rebates
 incentive payments
 and pricing arrangements. The review identified further misstatements
 The impacts of the supplier rebate misstatements on each period are discussed in restatement reference (a) throughout this note and in Note 23
As part of our review of supplier contracts and related arrangements in connection with the internal investigation
 we evaluated additional elements of such arrangements
 including the classification of embedded lease provisions as capital or operating. We had initially classified certain embedded lease provisions as capital leases and allocated their fixed consideration to the lease components. As a result of our analysis
 and also taking into consideration
 among other elements
 the total value of supplier contracts and related arrangements
we determined that the classification of the embedded lease element for certain contracts should have been classified as an operating lease instead of a capital lease. In addition
The impacts of the capital lease misstatements on each period are discussed in restatement reference (b) throughout this note and in Note 23
As previously disclosed in March 2018
 we retrospectively corrected immaterial misclassifications in our statements of income principally related to customer incentive program expense misclassifications. The impacts of the customer incentive program expense misclassifications on each period are discussed in restatement reference (c) throughout this note and in Note 23
We recorded adjustments to recognize certain balance sheet misclassifications in the correct period. These adjustments primarily related to the classification of state income taxes
 capital expenditures
 and the classification of products held at co-packer locations. The impacts of the balance sheet misclassifications on each period are discussed in restatement reference (d) throughout this note and in Note 23
We recorded adjustments to recognize certain income tax items in the correct period
 primarily deferred tax adjustments related to a Brazilian subsidiary
 as well as return-to-provision adjustments and various other misclassifications. The income tax impacts of all misstatements outside of this category are included in their respective misstatement categories. The impacts of income tax misstatements on each period are discussed in restatement reference (e) throughout this note and in Note 23
We recorded an adjustment to recognize certain non-cash impairment losses in the correct period. In 2018
 we had determined that a definite-lived intangible asset had been impaired in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to a license termination in that period and recorded an out-of-period correction to recognize the non-cash impairment loss. In addition
 we recorded an adjustment to correct goodwill impairment losses related to our Australia and New Zealand reporting unit
 which had been overstated. The impacts of the impairment misstatements on each period are discussed in restatement reference (f) throughout this note and in Note 23
We recorded adjustments to correct other identified out-of-period and uncorrected misstatements that were not material
 individually or in the aggregate
 to our consolidated financial statements. These other misstatements were primarily related to structured payable and product financing arrangements
 postemployment benefit plans
 inventory write-offs
 certain accrued liabilities
 and other misstatements within net sales and certain income tax and balance sheet accounts. The impacts of the other misstatements on each period are discussed in restatement reference (g) throughout this note and in Note 23
The following tables represent our restated consolidated statements of income
 statements of comprehensive income
 statements of equity
 and statements of cash flows for the years ended December 30
 2017 and December 31
 2016
 as well as our restated consolidated balance sheet at December 30
Following the restated consolidated financial statement tables
 we have presented a reconciliation from our prior periods as previously reported to the restated values. The values as previously reported for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 were derived from our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30

Our revenues are primarily derived from customer orders for the purchase of our products. We recognize revenues as performance obligations are fulfilled when control passes to our customers. We record revenues net of variable consideration
 including consumer incentives and performance obligations related to trade promotions
 excluding taxes
Advertising
 Consumer Incentives
We promote our products with advertising
 consumer incentives
 and performance obligations related to trade promotions. Consumer incentives and trade promotions include
 but are not limited to
 discounts
 coupons
 rebates
 performance-based in-store display activities
 and volume-based incentives. Variable consideration related to consumer incentive and trade promotion activities is recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization

We recognize compensation costs related to equity awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award
 years. These costs are primarily recognized within SG&amp;A. We estimate expected forfeitures rather than recognizing forfeitures as they occur in determining our equity award compensation costs. We classify equity award compensation costs primarily within general corporate expenses. See Note 12
 
We maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. These include pension benefits
 postretirement health care benefits
 and defined contribution benefits. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over an appropriate term based on
 among other things
 the cost component and whether the plan is active or inactive. Changes in the fair value of our plan assets result in net actuarial gains or losses. These net actuarial gains and losses are deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) and amortized within other expense/(income)
 See Note 13
 
We recognize income taxes based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and record deferred tax assets or liabilities for any difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We also recognize deferred tax assets for temporary differences
 operating loss carryforwards
 and tax credit carryforwards. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans
 planning opportunities
 and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets
 primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards
We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly
We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances
 we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years
 we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs
 along with a corresponding adjustment to our provision for/(benefit from) income taxes. The resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period
Dividends are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. When we have an accumulated deficit

 plant and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software

 current-period operating or cash flow losses
 significant declines in forecasted operations
 or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for impairment of assets held for use
 we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist
 the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of
 if any
 are based on the estimated proceeds to be received
 reporting units
We test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter
 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount. Such events and circumstances could include a sustained decrease in our market capitalization
 increased competition or unexpected loss of market share
 increased input costs beyond projections (for example due to regulatory or industry changes)
 disposals of significant brands or components of our business
 unexpected business disruptions (for example due to a natural disaster or loss of a customer
 supplier
 or other significant business relationship)
 unexpected significant declines in operating results
 or significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate. We test reporting units for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. We test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value
 we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount
 in the case of reporting units
Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated periods benefited. We review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse changes in the business climate
 current-period operating or cash flow losses
 significant declines in forecasted operations
 or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for impairment of definite-lived intangible assets held for use

 the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on definite-lived intangible assets to be disposed of
 if any
 are based on the estimated proceeds to be received
See Note 10
 
As we source our commodities on global markets and periodically enter into financing or other arrangements abroad
 we use a variety of risk management strategies and financial instruments to manage commodity price
 foreign currency exchange rate
 and interest rate risks. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. One way we do this is through actively hedging our risks through the use of derivative instruments. As a matter of policy
 we do not use highly leveraged derivative instruments
Derivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value
Certain derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment
 while others are not designated as hedging instruments and are marked to market through net income/(loss). The gains and losses on cash flow hedges are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) and are recognized in net income/(loss) at the time the hedged item affects net income/(loss)
 in the same line item as the underlying hedged item. The excluded component on cash flow hedges is recognized in net income/(loss) over the life of the hedging relationship in the same income statement line item as the underlying hedged item. We also designate certain derivatives and non-derivatives as net investment hedges to hedge the net assets of certain foreign subsidiaries which are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in the value of these derivatives and remeasurements of our non-derivatives designated as net investment hedges are calculated each period using the spot method
 with changes reported in foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses). Such amounts will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of our investment in the underlying foreign operations. The excluded component on derivatives designated as net investment hedges is recognized in net income/(loss) within interest expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses related to derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments is determined based on the underlying intent of the contracts. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item
To qualify for hedge accounting
 a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged must be achieved at inception and maintained throughout the hedged period. When a hedging instrument no longer meets the specified level of hedging effectiveness
 we reclassify the related hedge gains or losses previously deferred into other comprehensive income/(losses) to net income within other expense/(income)
 net. We formally document our risk management objectives
 our strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions
 the nature of and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items
 and the method for assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally
 for qualified hedges of forecasted transactions
 we specifically identify the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transactions. If it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur
Unrealized gains and losses on our commodity derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in cost of products sold and are included within general corporate expenses until realized. Once realized
 the gains and losses are included within the applicable segment operating results. See Note 14
&#160;
We have numerous investments in our foreign subsidiaries
 the net assets of which are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage this risk by utilizing derivative and non-derivative instruments
 including cross-currency swap contracts
 foreign exchange contracts
We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany actual and forecasted transactions. Our principal foreign currency exposures that are hedged include the British pound sterling
 euro
&#160;From time to time
 we have used derivative instruments
 including interest rate swaps
 We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily&#160;use as raw materials.&#160;We enter into commodity purchase contracts primarily for dairy products
 meat products
 coffee beans
 sugar
 vegetable&#160;oils
 wheat products
 corn products
&#160;and cocoa products. These commodity purchase contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative&#160;instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases and normal sales exception. We also use commodity futures
 options
 and swaps to&#160;economically hedge the price of certain commodity costs
 including the commodities noted above
 as well as packaging products
 diesel fuel
For all significant foreign operations
We apply highly inflationary accounting if the cumulative inflation rate in an economy for a three-year period meets or exceeds 100%. Under highly inflationary accounting
 the financial statements of a subsidiary are remeasured into our reporting currency (U.S. dollars) based on the legally available exchange rate at which we expect to settle the underlying transactions. Exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in net income/(loss)
 rather than accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) on the balance sheet

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]





In March 2017
 This ASU became effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018. Under the new guidance
 the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost must be presented in the same statement of income line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period. Other components of net periodic benefit cost must be disaggregated from the service cost component in the statements of income and must be presented outside the operating income/(loss) subtotal. Additionally

In May 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09
 Under this ASU
 companies must apply a five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU may be applied using a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective transition method
The ASU also provides for certain practical expedients
 including the option to expense as incurred the incremental costs of obtaining a contract
We adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2018 using the full retrospective method and the practical expedient described above. Upon adoption
 we made the following policy elections: (i) we account for shipping and handling costs as contract fulfillment costs
 and (ii) we exclude taxes imposed on and collected from customers in revenue producing transactions (e.g.
 sales
 use
In October 2016
 the FASB issued 
 such as intellectual property and property
Under the new accounting guidance
 current and deferred income taxes should be recognized upon transfer of the assets. Previously
In January 2017
 If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets

In January 2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 related to goodwill impairment testing. This ASU eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under the new guidance
 if a reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount exceeds its fair value
 Previously
 if the fair value of a reporting unit was lower than its carrying amount (Step 1)
 an entity was required to calculate any impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount (Step 2). Additionally
 under the new standard
 companies that have reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts will no longer be required to perform the qualitative assessment to determine whether to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. As a result
 reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts will generally be expected to pass the simplified impairment test; however
We early adopted this guidance on a prospective basis as of April 1
 2018 (our annual impairment testing date in the second quarter of 2018). As a result of adopting this ASU
 we no longer perform Step 2 while completing our goodwill impairment testing
In August 2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-12 related to accounting for hedging activities. This guidance impacted the accounting for financial (e.g.
 foreign exchange and interest rate) and non-financial (e.g.
 commodity) hedging activities. We early adopted this guidance on a modified retrospective basis in the third quarter of 2018. Upon adoption
Defer changes in the spot rate of the hedging instrument into other comprehensive income/(loss)
 while the excluded component (i.e.
 forward points or option premiums or discounts) is amortized into net income/(loss) over the life of the hedging relationship. When the excluded component is released or the forecasted transaction occurs
Additionally
 ASU 2017-12 eliminated the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness; therefore
 See our consolidated statements of other comprehensive income

 Note 14
 
 and Note 15
 
In February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 to establish the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the amount
 timing
The ASU also provides for certain practical expedients. Among the practical expedients is an optional transition method that allows companies to apply the guidance at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings/(deficit) on the adoption date. We plan to elect this practical expedient upon adoption. We also plan to elect the package of practical expedients that will allow us to carry forward our determination of whether a lease exists
 the classification of a lease
 and whether initial direct lease costs exist for purposes of transition to the new standard. We do not expect to use the hindsight practical expedient. We do plan to elect the land easement option
We have completed our scoping reviews
 identified our significant leases by geography and by asset type
 and developed our accounting policies and expected policy elections
 which will take effect upon adoption of the standard. We have executed our lease data extraction strategy and completed data extraction efforts. Our identified accounting system
 which will support the future state leasing process
 is also ready for implementation. We have completed our future state process design as part of the overall system implementation. Upon adoption
 we expect that our financial statement disclosures will be expanded to present additional details of our leasing arrangements. We expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements. We currently estimate that
 upon adoption
In June 2016
This ASU applies to financial assets measured at amortized cost
 including loans
 held-to-maturity debt securities
 net investments in leases
 and trade accounts receivable as well as certain off-balance sheet credit exposures
In February 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-02 related to reclassifying tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (&#8220;U.S. Tax Reform&#8221;) enacted on December 22
U.S. Tax Reform reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%. ASC Topic 740
 
 requires the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of such changes in tax laws or rates to be presented in net income/(loss) from continuing operations. However
This ASU allows companies to reclassify such stranded tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) to retained earnings/(deficit). This reclassification adjustment is optional
 and if elected
Additionally
In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-13 related to fair value measurement disclosures. This ASU removes the requirement to disclose the amount of and reasons for transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy
 the policy for determining that a transfer has occurred
 and valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. Additionally
 this ASU modifies the disclosures related to the measurement uncertainty for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements (by removing the requirement to disclose sensitivity to future changes) and the timing of liquidation of investee assets (by removing the timing requirement in certain instances). The guidance also requires new disclosures for Level 3 financial assets and liabilities
 including the amount and location of unrealized gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) and additional information related to significant unobservable inputs used in determining Level 3 fair value measurements. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020. Early adoption of the guidance in whole is permitted. Alternatively
 companies may early adopt removed or modified disclosures and delay adoption of the additional disclosures until their effective date. Certain of the amendments in this ASU must be applied prospectively upon adoption
 while other amendments must be applied retrospectively upon adoption. We elected to early adopt the provisions related to removing disclosures in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2018 on a retrospective basis. Accordingly
 we have removed information related to our valuation process for Level 3 fair value measurements for pension plan investments within Note 13
. We also removed information about the amount of and reasons for transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy from Note 14
In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-14 related to the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The guidance requires sponsors of these plans to provide additional disclosures
 including weighted-average interest rates used in the company&#8217;s cash balance plans and a narrative description of reasons for any significant gains or losses impacting the benefit obligation for the period. Additionally
In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-15 related to accounting for implementation costs incurred in hosted cloud computing service arrangements. Under the new guidance
 implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract should be expensed or capitalized based on the nature of the costs and the project stage during which such costs are incurred. If the implementation costs qualify for capitalization
 they must be amortized over the term of the hosting arrangement and assessed for impairment. Companies must disclose the nature of any hosted cloud computing service arrangements. This ASU also provides guidance for balance sheet and income statement presentation of capitalized implementation costs and statement of cash flows presentation for the related payments. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020. Early adoption is permitted
 including in an interim period. This guidance may be adopted either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on our financial statements and related disclosures as well as the timing of adoption and the application method.

As part of our restructuring activities
 we incur expenses that qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP. These include severance and employee benefit costs and other exit costs. Severance and employee benefit costs primarily relate to cash severance
 non-cash severance
 including accelerated equity award compensation expense
 and pension and other termination benefits. Other exit costs primarily relate to lease and contract terminations. We also incur expenses that are an integral component of
 and directly attributable to
 our restructuring activities
 which do not qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP. These include asset-related costs and other implementation costs. Asset-related costs primarily relate to accelerated depreciation and asset impairment charges. Other implementation costs primarily relate to start-up costs of new facilities
 professional fees
 asset relocation costs
 costs to exit facilities
Employee severance and other termination benefit packages are primarily determined based on established benefit arrangements
 local statutory requirements
 or historical benefit practices. We recognize the contractual component of these benefits when payment is probable and estimable; additional elements of severance and termination benefits associated with non-recurring benefits are recognized ratably over each employee&#8217;s required future service period. Charges for accelerated depreciation are recognized on long-lived assets that will be taken out of service before the end of their normal service
 in which case depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life. Asset impairments establish a new fair value basis for assets held for disposal or sale
At the end of 2017
 we had substantially completed our multi-year program announced following the 2015 Merger (the &#8220;Integration Program&#8221;)

 We test our reporting units for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter
 as of April 1
 2018. We utilized the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. As a result of our 2018 annual impairment test
For the fourth quarter of 2018
 in connection with the preparation of our year-end financial statements
 we assessed the changes in circumstances that occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair values of any reporting units were below their carrying amounts. Although our annual impairment test is performed during the second quarter
While there was no single determinative event or factor
 reporting units
 including U.S. Grocery
 U.S. Refrigerated
 Canada Retail
 Australia and New Zealand
 Northeast Asia
 Southeast Asia
 and Other Latin America
These factors included: (i) a sustained decrease in our share price in November and December of 2018
 which reduced our market capitalization below the book value of net assets; (ii) the completion of our fourth quarter results
 which were below management&#8217;s expectations due to several factors such as higher than expected supply chain costs and increased competition; (iii) the development and approval of our 2019 annual operating plan in December 2018
 which provided additional insights into expectations and priorities for the coming years
 such as lower growth and margin expectations; (iv) the announcement in November 2018 to sell certain assets in our natural cheese portfolio in Canada
 which changed the composition and use of the remaining assets and brands in the associated reporting unit; (v) fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in certain countries; (vi) increased interest rates in certain locations
 reporting units were below their carrying amounts
 we performed an interim impairment test on these reporting units as of December 29
 2018. After assessing the totality of circumstances
As a result of our interim test
 reporting units
 including U.S. Refrigerated
 Canada Retail
 Southeast Asia
 Northeast Asia
 reporting units we tested were determined to not be impaired. We utilized the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. Drivers of these impairment losses
 by reporting unit
 impairment loss in our U.S. Refrigerated reporting unit within our United States segment due to revised 2019 base and future year margin expectations
 primarily in the natural cheese and meats categories
 and
 to a lesser extent
 expectations for lower long-term net sales growth in the natural and processed cheese categories. Changes in future year margin expectations were primarily driven by sustained increases in supply chain costs
 expectations for lower pricing to maintain competitive positioning
 and expectations for increased marketing investments
 primarily in response to private label competition
 as well as customer-driven packaging investments. Changes in expectations for lower long-term net sales growth were primarily due to sustained private label competition and anticipated trends in consumer preferences. Our revised expectations were based on the completion of our fourth quarter results
 which were below management&#8217;s expectations
 and the development of our 2019 annual operating plan in December 2018. Additionally
 our revised expectations were based on the development of our global five-year operating plan
 impairment loss in our Canada Retail reporting unit within our Canada segment due to lower positive net sales growth expectations and revised 2019 base and future year margin expectations
 as well as the reassessment of our Canadian operations following the announcement in November to sell certain assets in our natural cheese portfolio in Canada. We revised our net sales growth expectations primarily due to our expected exit of the natural cheese category and expected declines in the coffee category (exclusive of our coffee business acquisition in Canada in 2018). Our revised expectations were based on the completion of our fourth quarter results
 which were below management&#8217;s expectations
 impairment loss in our Southeast Asia reporting unit within our Rest of World segment due to margin and net sales declines in the seafood and seasonal cordials categories and foreign exchange rate declines in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Our revised expectations were based on the completion of our fourth quarter results
 which were below management&#8217;s expectations
 impairment loss in our Northeast Asia reporting unit within our Rest of World segment due to margin and net sales declines as well as foreign exchange rate declines in Japan and Korea. Our revised expectations were based on the completion of our fourth quarter results
 which were below management&#8217;s expectations
 impairment loss in our Other Latin America reporting unit within our Rest of World segment due to net sales and margin declines in the region. Our revised expectations were based on the completion of our fourth quarter results

On December 22
 2017
 U.S. Tax Reform legislation was enacted by the federal government. The legislation significantly changed U.S. tax laws by
 among other things
 lowering the federal corporate tax rate from 
 effective January 1
 2018 and imposing a one-time toll charge on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 30
 2017. In addition
 there were many new provisions
 including changes to bonus depreciation
 revised deductions for executive compensation and interest expense
 a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (&#8220;GILTI&#8221;)
 the base erosion anti-abuse tax (&#8220;BEAT&#8221;)
 and a deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (&#8220;FDII&#8221;). While the corporate tax rate reduction was effective January 1
 2018
 we accounted for this anticipated rate change in 2017
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 issued by the SEC in December 2017 provided us with up to one year to finalize accounting for the impacts of U.S. Tax Reform and allowed for provisional estimates when actual amounts could not be determined. As of December 30
 2017
 we had made estimates of our deferred income tax benefit related to the corporate rate change
 the toll charge
 certain components of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities
 including depreciation and executive compensation
 and a change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion. In connection with U.S. Tax Reform
 we reassessed our international investment assertion and no longer consider the historic earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 30
 2017 to be indefinitely reinvested. We made an estimate of local country withholding taxes that would be owed when our historic earnings are distributed. Additionally
Our initial accounting for U.S. Tax Reform as of December 30
 2017 resulted in a net tax benefit of approximately&#160;
&#160;related to the corporate rate change
&#160;for other tax expenses
 including a change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion. Related to our indefinite reinvestment assertion change
&#160;of historic earnings as of December 30
In the first quarter of 2018

As of December 29
 2018
 we had finalized our accounting for U.S. Tax Reform. The final impact (the majority of which was recorded in 2017

 for other tax expenses
Related to our indefinite reinvestment assertion change
 of historic earnings as of December 30
Additionally
 as of December 29
 2018 to reflect our investment in an Indian subsidiary that is no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested. At the same time
 As of December 29
 2018
We consider the unremitted current year earnings of certain international subsidiaries that impose local country taxes on dividends to be indefinitely reinvested. For those undistributed earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested
 our intent is to reinvest these funds in our international operations

U.S. state and local income taxes
The provision for income taxes consists of provisions for federal
 state
 and foreign income taxes. We operate in an international environment; accordingly
 the consolidated effective tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the earnings in various locations and the applicable tax rates. Additionally
 the calculation of the percentage point impact of U.S. Tax Reform
 tax exempt income
 and other items on the effective tax rate shown in the table above are affected by income/(loss) before income taxes. Fluctuations in the amount of income generated across locations around the world could impact comparability of reconciling items between periods. Additionally
The 2018 effective tax rate was lower
 primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. federal statutory rate
 non-deductible items (including goodwill impairments
 nonmonetary currency devaluation losses
 and the wind-up of non-U.S. pension plans)
 the impact of the federal tax on GILTI
 and the revaluation of our deferred tax balances due to changes in state tax laws following U.S. Tax Reform
 See Note 10
 
The tax provision for the 2017 tax year benefited from U.S. Tax Reform enacted on December 22
 in 2017 primarily reflects adjustments to our deferred tax positions for the lower federal income tax rate
The tax provision for the 2016 tax year included a benefit related to the tax effect of statutory tax rate changes

Disclosure of Compensation Related Costs
 Share-based Payments [Abstract]





We grant equity awards
 including stock options
 restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;)
 and performance share units (&#8220;PSUs&#8221;)

Prior to approval of the 2016 Omnibus Plan
 we issued non-qualified stock options to select employees under the 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (&#8220;2013 Omnibus Plan&#8221;). As a result of the 2015 Merger

Prior to the 2015 Merger
 Kraft issued equity-based awards
 including stock options and RSUs
 under its 2012 Performance Incentive Plan. As a result of the 2015 Merger
 each outstanding Kraft stock option was converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of our common stock based upon an option adjustment ratio
 annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the original grant date
 years. RSUs generally cliff vest on the third anniversary of the original grant date. In accordance with the terms of the 2012 Performance Incentive Plan
In addition
 prior to the 2015 Merger
 Kraft issued performance-based
 long-term incentive awards (&#8220;Performance Shares&#8221;)
 which vested based on varying performance

The risk-free interest rate represented the constant maturity U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the grant date
 with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options. The expected life is the period over which our employees are expected to hold their options. Due to the lack of historical data
 we calculated expected life using the Safe Harbor method
 which uses the weighted average vesting period and the contractual term of the options. In 2018
 we estimated volatility using a blended volatility approach of term-matched historical volatility from our daily stock prices and weighted average implied volatility. In 2017 and 2016
 we estimated volatility using a blended approach of implied volatility and peer volatility. We calculated peer volatility as the average of the term-matched
 leverage-adjusted historical volatilities of Colgate-Palmolive Co.

As noted above
 as a result of the failure to remain current in our reporting requirements with the SEC
 we are not currently eligible to use Form S-8 registration statements. As a result
 on April 23
 2019
 the administrator of the Kraft Heinz Savings Plan and the Kraft Heinz Union Savings Plan (collectively
 the &#8220;Plan&#8221;) issued a notice to Plan participants advising participants of a blackout period during which participants are prohibited from acquiring beneficial ownership of additional interests in The Kraft Heinz Company Stock Fund. If we are not able to become and remain current in our reporting requirements with the SEC
We maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. Current defined benefit pension plans are provided primarily for certain domestic union and foreign employees. Local statutory requirements govern many of these plans. The pension benefits of our unionized workers are in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreement covering their employment. Defined contribution plans are provided for certain domestic unionized

The underlying basis of the investment strategy of our defined benefit plans is to ensure that pension funds are available to meet the plans&#8217; benefit obligations when they are due. Our investment objectives include: investing plan assets in a high-quality
 diversified manner in order to maintain the security of the funds; achieving an optimal return on plan assets within specified risk tolerances; and investing according to local regulations and requirements specific to each country in which a defined benefit plan operates. The investment strategy expects equity investments to yield a higher return over the long term than fixed-income securities

We have a subsidiary in Venezuela that manufactures and sells a variety of products
We apply highly inflationary accounting to the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary and include these results in our consolidated financial statements. Under highly inflationary accounting
 the functional currency of our Venezuelan subsidiary is the U.S. dollar (the reporting currency of Kraft Heinz)
 although the majority of its transactions are in Venezuelan bolivars. As a result
 we must revalue the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary to U.S. dollars. We revalue the income statement using daily weighted average DICOM (as defined below) rates
 and we revalue the bolivar denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the period-end DICOM spot rate. The resulting revaluation gains and losses are recorded in current net income/(loss)
 rather than accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses). These gains and losses are classified within other expense/(income)
In February 2018
 the Venezuelan government eliminated the official exchange rate
 which was available through the Sistema de Divisa Protegida (&#8220;DIPRO&#8221;) for purchases and sales of certain essential items

. In addition to DICOM
Our Venezuelan subsidiary obtains U.S. dollars through exports and royalty payments. These U.S. dollars are primarily used for purchases of tomato paste and spare parts for manufacturing
December&#160;29

our Venezuelan subsidiary has sufficient U.S. dollars to fund these operational needs in the foreseeable future. However
 further deterioration of the economic environment or regulation changes could jeopardize our export business. Our Venezuelan subsidiary has increasingly sourced production inputs locally
 including tomato paste and sugar
 in order to reduce reliance on U.S. dollars
Our results of operations in Venezuela reflect a controlled subsidiary. We continue to have sufficient currency liquidity and pricing flexibility to control our operations. However
 the continuing economic uncertainty
 strict labor laws
 and evolving government controls over imports
 prices
 currency exchange
 and payments present a challenging operating environment. Increased restrictions imposed by the Venezuelan government or further deterioration of the economic environment could impact our ability to control our Venezuelan operations and could lead us to deconsolidate our Venezuelan subsidiary in the future. We currently do not expect to make any new investments or contributions into Venezuela.

 due to the delays in the preparation of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 29
 2018 and the fiscal quarter ended March 30
 2019
However
 as previously disclosed
 on March 22
 2019
 we entered into a Waiver and Consent No. 1 (the &#8220;Original Waiver&#8221;) with respect to the Senior Credit Facility
 pursuant to which the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank
 N.A.
 as administrative agent
 granted a temporary waiver of compliance by us with respect to the requirement to furnish the lenders a copy of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December&#160;29
 2018. Pursuant to the Original Waiver
 we were required to provide consolidated financial statements no later than May 14
 2019. Due to additional delays in our financial reporting
 on May 10
 2019
 we entered into a Waiver and Consent No. 2 (the &#8220;Second Waiver&#8221;) with respect to the Senior Credit Facility
 pursuant to which the lenders
 as party to the Senior Credit Facility
 and JPMorgan Chase Bank
 N.A.
 as administrative agent
 granted a temporary waiver of compliance by us with respect to the requirements to furnish the lenders copies of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December&#160;29
 2018 and for the fiscal quarter ended March 30
 2019. Pursuant to the Second Waiver and in order to remedy our noncompliance
 we are required to provide consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29
 2018 no later than June 28

 due to the delays in the preparation of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 29
 2018 and the fiscal quarter ended March 30

 we were not in compliance with certain reporting covenants under certain indentures. The filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K will constitute compliance with the requirement to furnish the lenders a copy of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 29
 2018 no later than June 28

Under our existing indentures
 if we do not file required reports within specified time periods
 in the case of any other series of notes may deliver a notice of default for such series of notes which would commence the applicable cure period under such indenture.&#160;As of June 5
 2019
 none of the cure periods under our existing indentures have been triggered in connection with our failure to comply with the respective reporting covenants set forth in such indentures. However

Management evaluates segment performance based on several factors
Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense
 other expense/(income)
 net
 provision for/(benefit from) income taxes
 and depreciation and amortization (excluding integration and restructuring expenses); in addition to these adjustments
 we exclude
 when they occur
 the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses
 deal costs
 unrealized gains/(losses) on commodity hedges (the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized; once realized
 the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment&#8217;s operating results)
 impairment losses
 gains/(losses) on the sale of a business
 other gains/(losses) related to acquisitions and divestitures (e.g.
 tax and hedging impacts)

 remeasurement gains and losses)

The following tables represent our restated unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for each quarter-to-date and year-to-date interim period within the nine months ended September 29
 2018 and the fiscal year ended December 30
The values as previously reported for the fiscal quarters ended September 29

 and March 31
 2018 were derived from our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed on November 2

 and May 3
 2018
 respectively. The values as previously reported for the fiscal quarter ended December 30
 2017 were derived from our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30

 2018. The values as previously reported for the fiscal quarters ended September 30

In addition
 the condensed consolidated statements of income for the interim periods within the year ended December 30
 2017
 as previously reported
 did not originally reflect the adoption of ASU 2017-07 related to the presentation of net periodic benefit cost (pension and postretirement cost). This ASU was adopted in the first quarter of 2018 and was applied retrospectively for statement of income presentation of service cost components and other net periodic benefit cost components. Our condensed consolidated statements of income for the interim periods within fiscal year 2017 have been recast accordingly. See Note 4

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]





We have restated herein our previously issued condensed consolidating financial statements for fiscal years 2017 and 2016. Following the restated condensed consolidating financial statement tables
 we have presented our condensed consolidating financial statements as previously reported for fiscal years 2017 and 2016
 which were derived from our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30
 2017 filed on February 16
 2018. See Note 2
 
 for additional information
In addition
 the statements of income for fiscal years 2017 and 2016
 as previously reported
 did not originally reflect the adoption of ASU 2017-07 related to the presentation of net periodic benefit cost (pension and postretirement cost). This ASU was adopted in the first quarter of 2018 and was applied retrospectively for statement of income presentation of service cost components and other net periodic benefit cost components. The condensed consolidating statements of income for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 have been recast accordingly. See Note 4
 
Kraft Heinz fully and unconditionally guarantees the notes issued by our 100% owned operating subsidiary
 KHFC
 including the New Notes. See Note 19
 
Set forth below are the condensed consolidating financial statements presenting the results of operations
 financial position
 and cash flows of Kraft Heinz (as parent guarantor)
 KHFC (as subsidiary issuer of the notes)
 and the non-guarantor subsidiaries on a combined basis and eliminations necessary to arrive at the total reported information on a consolidated basis. This condensed consolidating financial information has been prepared and presented pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Rule 3-10
 &#8220;Financial Statements of Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities Registered or being Registered.&#8221; This information is not intended to present the financial position
 results of operations
 and cash flows of the individual companies or groups of companies in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Eliminations represent adjustments to eliminate investments in subsidiaries and intercompany balances and transactions between or among the parent guarantor
 subsidiary issuer

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]




Principles of Consolidation
 Policy
The consolidated financial statements include Kraft Heinz
 as well as our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions are eliminated.



Reportable Segments
 Policy
 reportable segments defined by geographic region: United States
 Canada
Europe
 Middle East
Our segments reflect a change
 effective in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018
Asia Pacific
 Middle East
operating segment into the historical Europe reportable segment
 See Note 22
 
 for our financial information by segment.



Use of Estimates
 Policy
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;)
 which requires us to make accounting policy elections
 estimates
 and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets
 liabilities
 reserves
 and expenses. These policy elections
 estimates
 and assumptions are based on our best estimates and judgments. We evaluate our policy elections
 estimates
 and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors
 including the current economic environment. We believe these estimates to be reasonable given the current facts available. We adjust our policy elections
 estimates
 and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Market volatility
 including foreign currency exchange rates
 increases the uncertainty inherent in our estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision
 actual results could differ significantly from estimates. If actual amounts differ from estimates
 we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known. Historically
 the aggregate differences
 if any
 between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.



Reclassifications
 Policy








Disclosure of accounting policy regarding (1) the principles it follows in consolidating or combining the separate financial statements
 including the principles followed in determining the inclusion or exclusion of subsidiaries or other entities in the consolidated or combined financial statements and (2) its treatment of interests (for example
 common stock
 a partnership interest or other means of exerting influence) in other entities
 for example consolidation or use of the equity or cost methods of accounting.  The accounting policy may also address the accounting treatment for intercompany accounts and transactions
 noncontrolling interest
 and the income statement treatment in consolidation for issuances of stock by a subsidiary.

 2018






Revenue Recognition
 Policy
Our revenues are primarily derived from customer orders for the purchase of our products. We recognize revenues as performance obligations are fulfilled when control passes to our customers. We record revenues net of variable consideration
 including consumer incentives and performance obligations related to trade promotions
 excluding taxes
 and including all shipping and handling charges billed to customers (accounting for shipping and handling charges that occur after the transfer of control as fulfillment costs). We also record a refund liability for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized. We base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors. We recognize costs paid to third party brokers to obtain contracts as expenses as our contracts are generally less than one year.



Advertising
 Consumer Incentives
 and Trade Promotions
 Policy
Advertising
 Consumer Incentives
We promote our products with advertising
 consumer incentives
 and performance obligations related to trade promotions. Consumer incentives and trade promotions include
 but are not limited to
 discounts
 coupons
 rebates
 performance-based in-store display activities
 and volume-based incentives. Variable consideration related to consumer incentive and trade promotion activities is recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization
 redemption rates
 and/or current period experience factors. We review and adjust these estimates at least quarterly based on actual experience and other information.



Research and Development Expense
 Policy




Stock-Based Compensation
 Policy
We recognize compensation costs related to equity awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award
 which is generally 



Postemployment Benefit Plans
 Policy
We maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees. These include pension benefits
 postretirement health care benefits
 and defined contribution benefits. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over an appropriate term based on
 among other things
 the cost component and whether the plan is active or inactive. Changes in the fair value of our plan assets result in net actuarial gains or losses. These net actuarial gains and losses are deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) and amortized within other expense/(income)
 net in future periods using the corridor approach. The corridor is 



Income Taxes
 Policy
We recognize income taxes based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and record deferred tax assets or liabilities for any difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We also recognize deferred tax assets for temporary differences
 operating loss carryforwards
 and tax credit carryforwards. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans
 planning opportunities
 and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets
 primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards
We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly
We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances
 we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years
 we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs
 along with a corresponding adjustment to our provision for/(benefit from) income taxes. The resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period
 but is not expected to be material to our financial position.



Common Stock and Preferred Stock Dividends
 Policy
Dividends are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. When we have an accumulated deficit
 dividends are recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.



Cash and Cash Equivalents
 Policy
Cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents that are legally restricted as to withdrawal or usage is classified in other current assets or other non-current assets
 as applicable
 on the consolidated balance sheets.



Inventories

 years. Capitalized software costs are included in property
 plant and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software
 years. We review long-lived assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse changes in the business climate
 current-period operating or cash flow losses
 significant declines in forecasted operations
 or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for impairment of assets held for use
 we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist
 the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of
 if any
 are based on the estimated proceeds to be received
 less costs of disposal.



Goodwill and Intangible Assets
 Policy
 reporting units
We test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter
 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount. Such events and circumstances could include a sustained decrease in our market capitalization
 increased competition or unexpected loss of market share
 increased input costs beyond projections (for example due to regulatory or industry changes)
 disposals of significant brands or components of our business
 unexpected business disruptions (for example due to a natural disaster or loss of a customer
 supplier
 or other significant business relationship)
 unexpected significant declines in operating results
 or significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate. We test reporting units for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. We test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value
 we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount
 in the case of reporting units
Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated periods benefited. We review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse changes in the business climate
 current-period operating or cash flow losses
 significant declines in forecasted operations
 or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for impairment of definite-lived intangible assets held for use
 we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist
 the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on definite-lived intangible assets to be disposed of
 if any
 are based on the estimated proceeds to be received
 less costs of disposal.



Financial Instruments
 Policy
As we source our commodities on global markets and periodically enter into financing or other arrangements abroad
 we use a variety of risk management strategies and financial instruments to manage commodity price
 foreign currency exchange rate
 and interest rate risks. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. One way we do this is through actively hedging our risks through the use of derivative instruments. As a matter of policy
 we do not use highly leveraged derivative instruments
Derivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value
Certain derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment
 while others are not designated as hedging instruments and are marked to market through net income/(loss). The gains and losses on cash flow hedges are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) and are recognized in net income/(loss) at the time the hedged item affects net income/(loss)
 in the same line item as the underlying hedged item. The excluded component on cash flow hedges is recognized in net income/(loss) over the life of the hedging relationship in the same income statement line item as the underlying hedged item. We also designate certain derivatives and non-derivatives as net investment hedges to hedge the net assets of certain foreign subsidiaries which are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in the value of these derivatives and remeasurements of our non-derivatives designated as net investment hedges are calculated each period using the spot method
 with changes reported in foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses). Such amounts will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of our investment in the underlying foreign operations. The excluded component on derivatives designated as net investment hedges is recognized in net income/(loss) within interest expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses related to derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments is determined based on the underlying intent of the contracts. Cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities. All other cash flows related to derivative instruments are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item
To qualify for hedge accounting
 a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged must be achieved at inception and maintained throughout the hedged period. When a hedging instrument no longer meets the specified level of hedging effectiveness
 we reclassify the related hedge gains or losses previously deferred into other comprehensive income/(losses) to net income within other expense/(income)
 net. We formally document our risk management objectives
 our strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions
 the nature of and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items
 and the method for assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally
 for qualified hedges of forecasted transactions
 we specifically identify the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transactions. If it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur
Unrealized gains and losses on our commodity derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in cost of products sold and are included within general corporate expenses until realized. Once realized
 the gains and losses are included within the applicable segment operating results. See Note 14
&#160;
We have numerous investments in our foreign subsidiaries
 the net assets of which are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage this risk by utilizing derivative and non-derivative instruments
 including cross-currency swap contracts
 foreign exchange contracts
We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany actual and forecasted transactions. Our principal foreign currency exposures that are hedged include the British pound sterling
 euro
&#160;From time to time
 we have used derivative instruments
 including interest rate swaps
 We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily&#160;use as raw materials.&#160;We enter into commodity purchase contracts primarily for dairy products
 meat products
 coffee beans
 sugar
 vegetable&#160;oils
 wheat products
 corn products
&#160;and cocoa products. These commodity purchase contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative&#160;instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases and normal sales exception. We also use commodity futures
 options
 and swaps to&#160;economically hedge the price of certain commodity costs
 including the commodities noted above
 as well as packaging products
 diesel fuel
 and natural gas. We do not designate these commodity contracts as hedging instruments.&#160;We also&#160;occasionally use futures to economically cross hedge&#160;a commodity exposure.



Translation of Foreign Currencies
 Policy
For all significant foreign operations
 the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each period end. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) on the balance sheet. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net income/(loss) for the period.



Highly Inflationary Accounting
 Policy
We apply highly inflationary accounting if the cumulative inflation rate in an economy for a three-year period meets or exceeds 100%. Under highly inflationary accounting
 the financial statements of a subsidiary are remeasured into our reporting currency (U.S. dollars) based on the legally available exchange rate at which we expect to settle the underlying transactions. Exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in net income/(loss)
 rather than accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) on the balance sheet
 until such time as the economy is no longer considered highly inflationary. Certain non-monetary assets and liabilities are recorded at the applicable historical exchange rates. We apply highly inflationary accounting to the results of our subsidiaries in Venezuela and Argentina.

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]




New Accounting Standards
 Policy [Policy Text Block]
In March 2017
 This ASU became effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018. Under the new guidance
 the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost must be presented in the same statement of income line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period. Other components of net periodic benefit cost must be disaggregated from the service cost component in the statements of income and must be presented outside the operating income/(loss) subtotal. Additionally

In May 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09
 Under this ASU
 companies must apply a five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU may be applied using a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective transition method
The ASU also provides for certain practical expedients
 including the option to expense as incurred the incremental costs of obtaining a contract
We adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2018 using the full retrospective method and the practical expedient described above. Upon adoption
 we made the following policy elections: (i) we account for shipping and handling costs as contract fulfillment costs
 and (ii) we exclude taxes imposed on and collected from customers in revenue producing transactions (e.g.
 sales
 use
In October 2016
 the FASB issued 
 such as intellectual property and property
Under the new accounting guidance
 current and deferred income taxes should be recognized upon transfer of the assets. Previously
In January 2017
 If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets
 the set is not a business. If this screen is not met
 the entity then determines if the set meets the minimum requirement of a business. For a set to be a business
In January 2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 related to goodwill impairment testing. This ASU eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under the new guidance
 if a reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount exceeds its fair value
 Previously
 if the fair value of a reporting unit was lower than its carrying amount (Step 1)
 an entity was required to calculate any impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount (Step 2). Additionally
 under the new standard
 companies that have reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts will no longer be required to perform the qualitative assessment to determine whether to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. As a result
 reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts will generally be expected to pass the simplified impairment test; however
We early adopted this guidance on a prospective basis as of April 1
 2018 (our annual impairment testing date in the second quarter of 2018). As a result of adopting this ASU
 we no longer perform Step 2 while completing our goodwill impairment testing
In August 2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-12 related to accounting for hedging activities. This guidance impacted the accounting for financial (e.g.
 foreign exchange and interest rate) and non-financial (e.g.
 commodity) hedging activities. We early adopted this guidance on a modified retrospective basis in the third quarter of 2018. Upon adoption
Defer changes in the spot rate of the hedging instrument into other comprehensive income/(loss)
 while the excluded component (i.e.
 forward points or option premiums or discounts) is amortized into net income/(loss) over the life of the hedging relationship. When the excluded component is released or the forecasted transaction occurs
Additionally
 ASU 2017-12 eliminated the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness; therefore
 See our consolidated statements of other comprehensive income
 Note 3
 
 Note 14
 
 and Note 15
 
In February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 to establish the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the amount
 timing
The ASU also provides for certain practical expedients. Among the practical expedients is an optional transition method that allows companies to apply the guidance at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings/(deficit) on the adoption date. We plan to elect this practical expedient upon adoption. We also plan to elect the package of practical expedients that will allow us to carry forward our determination of whether a lease exists
 the classification of a lease
 and whether initial direct lease costs exist for purposes of transition to the new standard. We do not expect to use the hindsight practical expedient. We do plan to elect the land easement option
We have completed our scoping reviews
 identified our significant leases by geography and by asset type
 and developed our accounting policies and expected policy elections
 which will take effect upon adoption of the standard. We have executed our lease data extraction strategy and completed data extraction efforts. Our identified accounting system
 which will support the future state leasing process
 is also ready for implementation. We have completed our future state process design as part of the overall system implementation. Upon adoption
 we expect that our financial statement disclosures will be expanded to present additional details of our leasing arrangements. We expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements. We currently estimate that
 upon adoption
In June 2016
This ASU applies to financial assets measured at amortized cost
 including loans
 held-to-maturity debt securities
 net investments in leases
 and trade accounts receivable as well as certain off-balance sheet credit exposures
In February 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-02 related to reclassifying tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (&#8220;U.S. Tax Reform&#8221;) enacted on December 22
U.S. Tax Reform reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%. ASC Topic 740
 
 requires the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of such changes in tax laws or rates to be presented in net income/(loss) from continuing operations. However
This ASU allows companies to reclassify such stranded tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) to retained earnings/(deficit). This reclassification adjustment is optional
 and if elected
Additionally
In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-13 related to fair value measurement disclosures. This ASU removes the requirement to disclose the amount of and reasons for transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy
 the policy for determining that a transfer has occurred
 and valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. Additionally
 this ASU modifies the disclosures related to the measurement uncertainty for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements (by removing the requirement to disclose sensitivity to future changes) and the timing of liquidation of investee assets (by removing the timing requirement in certain instances). The guidance also requires new disclosures for Level 3 financial assets and liabilities
 including the amount and location of unrealized gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) and additional information related to significant unobservable inputs used in determining Level 3 fair value measurements. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020. Early adoption of the guidance in whole is permitted. Alternatively
 companies may early adopt removed or modified disclosures and delay adoption of the additional disclosures until their effective date. Certain of the amendments in this ASU must be applied prospectively upon adoption
 while other amendments must be applied retrospectively upon adoption. We elected to early adopt the provisions related to removing disclosures in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2018 on a retrospective basis. Accordingly
 we have removed information related to our valuation process for Level 3 fair value measurements for pension plan investments within Note 13
. We also removed information about the amount of and reasons for transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy from Note 14
In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-14 related to the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The guidance requires sponsors of these plans to provide additional disclosures
 including weighted-average interest rates used in the company&#8217;s cash balance plans and a narrative description of reasons for any significant gains or losses impacting the benefit obligation for the period. Additionally
In August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-15 related to accounting for implementation costs incurred in hosted cloud computing service arrangements. Under the new guidance
 implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract should be expensed or capitalized based on the nature of the costs and the project stage during which such costs are incurred. If the implementation costs qualify for capitalization
 they must be amortized over the term of the hosting arrangement and assessed for impairment. Companies must disclose the nature of any hosted cloud computing service arrangements. This ASU also provides guidance for balance sheet and income statement presentation of capitalized implementation costs and statement of cash flows presentation for the related payments. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020. Early adoption is permitted
 including in an interim period. This guidance may be adopted either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on our financial statements and related disclosures as well as the timing of adoption and the application method.







Disclosure of accounting policy pertaining to new accounting pronouncements that may impact the entity's financial reporting. Includes
 but is not limited to
 quantification of the expected or actual impact.

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]




















































Number of operating segments. An operating segment is a component of an enterprise: (a) that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the same enterprise)
 (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the enterprise's chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance
 and (c) for which discrete financial information is available. An operating segment may engage in business activities for which it has yet to earn revenues
 for example
 start-up operations may be operating segments before earning revenues.

The estimated measure of the percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.
