In this Annual Report
 unless otherwise specified
 all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to common stock refer to the shares of our common stock.


As used in this Annual Report
 the terms we, us, our, Lollipop, and &#8220;Issuer&#8221; mean Lollipop Corporation unless the context clearly requires otherwise.





















Lollipop Corporation (&#8220;LPC&#8221;) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on November 17
 2011
 and established a fiscal year end of December 31. The objective of this corporation is to distribute sports nutritional supplements
 especially in ring form capable of being worn during exercise
 being distributed initially in Israel.



Our Company believes that the search for a healthier life is linked directly to an active lifestyle and to improvements in our eating habits and how we choose to supplement our diet. This seems to be a concern in the minds of many individuals who are also trying to live an active healthy life style
 including those participating in sporting events such as triathlons and marathons. LPC believes that the concept behind our sports nutritional supplements is aligned with healthy lifestyle concerns as we assist athletes whilst in the midst of their exercise or competition.

The market for sports nutritional supplements has been growing year over year
 and is a flourishing market. For example
 in the United States
 research released in 2008 revealed that consumers are increasingly incorporating sports nutritional supplements into their lifestyles. We intend to create a fully functional website (www.lollipopsports.com) with updates as to health events to occur in Israel and in other territories as a way to attract individuals who also will choose to purchase our sports nutritional supplements. We have secured the web domain and the current website is a template of what we expect to further develop. The website is still under construction.













through health stores
 candy sports
 kiosks; athletic equipment stores
 shoe stores;











We do not plan to manufacture out sports nutritional supplements directly
 but rather to have as yet unidentified third party suppliers from the Far-East and local partners at the point of distribution to deliver directly to our customers. We plan on establishing a commission based policy for each supplier/partner. We expect that our suppliers will be able to deliver the sports nutritional products to our clients using their existing structure. If one or all of our suppliers can&#8217;t provide delivery service
 we would have to hire a third party delivery company and
 in this case
 we would charge a delivery fee to our clients. In order to keep the delivery cost down
 we intend to seek for several clients who live in the same area
 so
 more deliveries would be made at each time.

Initially we intend to hire a freelance athlete and a known sports internet site to hand out free samples of our sports nutritional supplements at sporting events held in public locations.&#160;Initially
 we intended to pay the athlete mostly through the free use of our product
 uniform and payment when he or she appears at tournaments or other events at which we have a sales booth or promotional activities. We intend to do this at&#160;major soccer
 basketball and other sporting events
 running events and other public sports events
 including&#160;in the large metropolitan areas of Tel-Aviv and Haifa. We expect to also achieve some free &#8220;editorial&#8221; media coverage as these matches and the crowd is often covered by the evening news. We do not anticipate targeting high profile athletes.


















We plan to hire a yet undetermined distribution company to be responsible for distributing this product to retail chains. Our President will make the introduction into the retail chains by calling on the buyers of these establishments. All distribution and collection of monies will be done by the distributors we plan to hire in the future. Our product will have an additional 15% fee added on to it in order to cover the costs of the&#160;distributor. We intend to establish a direct sales channel with Eden Teva Markets which is a chain of health food stores in addition to the major food chain stores such as Supersol
 Blue Square
 and others. At the time of this Registration Statement
 however
 we have conducted no discussions or negotiations present with any potential retail distributor. We intend to offer them to sell our sports nutritional supplements and place the product on their shelves. Here too we intend to have students handing out tasters to passing customers
 thereby explaining the benefits of what we are selling.



It is our belief that the sports nutrition industry has reached a stage where the focus needs to be on acquiring new consumers while retaining existing ones. With new sports nutritional products and variants being launched frequently
 brands are fighting for both shelf space and consumer attention. The wide range of choices in terms of flavor
 form
 size
 and price is encouraging consumers to shift from product to product
 trying out tastes and other benefits. As a result
 most participants in the sports/fitness nutrition industry - with the exception of the top ten companies
 which have strong product profiles - find themselves struggling to retain customer loyalty. Developing stronger brands with distinct identities and clear-cut positioning holds the key to overcome this challenge.



In the last three years, the single most important factor driving the growth of the sports nutrition industry has been taste, says analyst of sports nutrition market. With an increasing number of mainstream consumers adopting sports nutritional products as a means of healthy living
 the taste factor will remain important for some more time to come.

Our management understands that functional benefits alone are not enough - the reason most sports nutrition products fail to attract mainstream consumers is their weak taste profile. Focused R&amp;D efforts on this area
 has resulted in an explosion of flavors - each product category from top manufacturers has at least three to four flavor variants. As the market tries to draw more mainstream consumers
 the importance of taste and texture profiles is expected to increase further. We believe that a sports nutrition supplement in the form of a lollipop or other easily ingestible &#8220;candy&#8221;&#160;form (collectively referred to as a &#8220;sports nutritional supplement&#8221;) while taking part in an athletic activity will add flavor to such participation.



One of the key factors influencing the demand for sports nutrition products is the awareness level of the potential consumer
 which is usually bolstered by books
 magazines
 and other media. Increasing health consciousness and focus on issues such as obesity-related deaths and the adverse effects of eating wrong foods is steering people toward healthy lifestyles. The average consumer now feels that regular diets do not provide them with all the essential nutrients they need - something sports nutrition products can do. Accordingly
 manufacturers are also promoting sports nutrition products as health foods
 which have an effect on physical appearance as well as performance.

Management feels that there is a large potential growth in the development of online sales of sports nutritional supplements
 particularly those which can be consumed during activity manufactured with key vitamins. Lollipop Corporation intends to penetrate this market using a strategy of attracting customers to buy its sports nutritional supplements by explaining the health and athletic benefits of an sports nutritional supplement. We have no arrangements in place with any of the companies identified as sports nutritional supplement suppliers.


















Our business will be based on the development of the website www.lollipopsports.com
 from which we expect to attract customers who are interested in purchasing sports nutritional supplements which will be available in ring and sucking candy form for consumption
 during or after their training or participation in sporting events.



Currently
 we are not offering any services or selling any product in our website as we are still in the development stage of our company. Our main competitor is a local Israeli based company
 On Target Sports founded in 2005 that has focused on importing and marketing specialty equipment/gear and nutrition for endurance athletes
 in order to help them reach their goal. Their wholesale chain covers the entire country with over 100 stores: Bike
 professional running
 triathlon
 fitness clubs
 health and nutrition. In addition to traditional stores
 their distribution network includes kiosks and booths at major sports events year round
 in order to showcase its sports nutritional products and to meet its customers' needs. We intend to sell our sports nutritional products in these markets and believe that our main advantage will be our ability to cooperate with other food distributors and work within their networks as an additional source of endurance products. We expect to have a significant distinction from our competition due to our business model
 where we plan to offer different sports nutritional products from those available on our competitors&#8217; websites such as:





























Since we are initially targeting the market segment&#160;to ages&#160;18 to 50
 we believe that in addition to advertising at triathlon
 running and other sports events
 the internet will play an important marketing vehicle to get Lollipop Corporation known. Bearing this in mind
 our plan consists of:

Facebook (www.facebook.com): by creating a profile for Lollipop Corporation
 we expect to join a community interested in sports nutritional supplements and products. In this way
 we can make our business known and attract more potential users to our services.

Twitter (www.twitter.com): by posting information about sports nutritional supplements and products and our product benefits while exercising or training
 we intend to promote our business and attract more users to our website. Also
 by encouraging our users to post opinions and suggestions about our sports nutritional supplement we expect to raise interest to our business.




















We intend
 in due course
 subject to legal advice
 to apply for trademark protection and/or copyright protection in Israel and other jurisdictions. We intend to aggressively assert our rights trademark and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property
 including product design
 product research and concepts and recognized trademarks. These rights are protected through the acquisition of trademark registrations
 the maintenance of copyrights
 and
 where appropriate
 litigation against those who are
 in our opinion
 infringing these rights.

While there can be no assurance that registered trademarks and copyrights will protect our proprietary information
 we intend to assert our intellectual property rights against any infringer. Although any assertion of our rights can result in a substantial cost to
 and diversion of effort by
 our Company
 management believes that the protection of our intellectual property rights is a key component of our operating strategy.




We are unaware of and do not anticipate having to expend significant resources to comply with any governmental regulations. However
 we still need to verify certifications and possible government approvals needed to execute our business. We are subject to the laws and regulations of those jurisdictions in which we plan to sell our product
 which are generally applicable to business operations
 such as business licensing requirements
 income taxes and payroll taxes. In general
 the development and operation of our business is not subject to special regulatory and/or supervisory requirements.



As the date of this prospectus
 LPC has no paid staff. Mr. Fromer is the President
 CEO and Chairman of the Company. Mr. Fromer is employed elsewhere and has the flexibility to work on LPC up to 15 hours per week. He is prepared to devote more time to our operations as may be required. He is not being paid at present.





There are no employment agreements in existence. The Company presently does not have pension
 health
 annuity
 insurance
 stock options
 profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however
 the Company may adopt plans in the future. Management does not plan to hire additional employees at this time. Our Officers and Directors will be responsible for the initial servicing. When the Company raises enough funds and resumes the work on its current Internet website template (www.lollipopsports.com)
 it will hire an independent consultant for the further development and finalization of the site. The Company also intends to hire sales representatives initially on a commission only basis to keep administrative overhead to a minimum.






















In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the risk factors set forth in our Registration Statement that went effective on April 10
 2013
 stockholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors:

IF A MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK DOES NOT DEVELOP
 SHAREHOLDERS MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL THEIR SHARES

A market for our common stock may never develop. We intend to contact an authorized OTC Bulletin Board market-maker for sponsorship of our securities on the OTC Bulletin Board however
 our shares may never be traded on the bulletin board
 or
 if traded
 a public market may not materialize. If our common stock is not traded on the bulletin board or if a public market for our common stock does not develop
 investors may not be able to re-sell the shares of our common stock that they have purchased and may lose all of their investment.

BECAUSE OUR AUDITORS HAVE ISSUED A GOING CONCERN OPINION REGARDING OUR COMPANY
 THERE IS A RISK ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTING IN OUR BUSINESS

Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion regarding our Company
 as we do not have material assets
 nor do we have operations or a source of revenue sufficient to cover our operation costs. The Company has a net operating loss accumulated since inception (November 17
 2011) through December 31
 2013. The Company will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital through placement of our common stock in order to implement its business operations
 or merge with an operating company.



The ability of the Company to continue is dependent on raising capital to fund its business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly
 these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts
 or amount and classification of liabilities that might cause results from this uncertainty.

We reserve the right to seek additional funds through private placements of our common stock and/or through debt financing. Our ability to raise additional financing is unknown. We do not have any formal commitments or arrangements for the advancement or loan of funds. For these reasons
 our auditors stated in their report that they have substantial doubt we will be able to continue as a going concern. As a result
 there is an increased risk that you could lose the entire amount of your investment in our company.

THE COMPANY&#8217;S MANAGEMENT COULD ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES
 SINCE THE COMPANY HAS 180
000
000 AUTHORIZED SHARES
 DILLUTING THE CURRENT SHARE HOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY

The company has 180
000
000 authorized shares
 of which only 1
032
428 are currently issued and outstanding. The company&#8217;s management could
 without the consent of the existing shareholders
 issue substantially more shares
 causing a large dilution in the equity position of the company&#8217;s current shareholders. Additionally
 large share issuances would generally have a negative impact on the company&#8217;s share price. It is possible that
 due to additional share issuance
 you could lose a substantial amount
 or all
 of your investment.
















IN THE EVENT THAT OUR SHARES ARE TRADED
 THEY MAY TRADE UNDER $5.00 PER SHARE AND THUS WILL BE A PENNY STOCK. TRADING IN PENNY STOCKS HAS MANY RESTRICTIONS AND THESE RESTRICTIONS COULD SEVERLY AFFECT THE PRICE AND LIQUIDITY OF OUR SHARES

In the event that our shares are traded
 and our stock trades below $5.00 per share
 our stock would be known as a &#8220;penny stock&#8221;
 which is subject to various regulations involving disclosures to be given to you prior to the purchase of any penny stock. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) has adopted regulations which generally define a &#8220;penny stock&#8221; to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share
 subject to certain exceptions. Depending on market fluctuations
 our common stock could be considered to be a &#8220;penny stock&#8221;. A penny stock is subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by these rules
 the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of these securities. In addition
 he must receive the purchaser&#8217;s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. He must also provide certain written disclosures to the purchaser. Consequently
 the &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities
 and may negatively affect the ability of holders of shares of our common stock to resell them. These disclosures require you to acknowledge that you understand the risks associated with buying penny stocks and that you can absorb the loss of your entire investment. Penny stocks are low priced securities that do not have a very high trading volume. Consequently
 the price of the stock is often volatile and you may not be able to buy or sell the stock when you want to.

SINCE OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CURRENTLY OWN 84% OF THE OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK
 INVESTORS MAY FIND THAT THEIR DECISIONS ARE CONTRARY TO THEIR INTERESTS

Our Officers and Directors
 own 84% of the outstanding shares. Accordingly
 they will have full control in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters
 including mergers
 consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets
 and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control. While we have no current plans with regard to any merger
 consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets
 the interests of our officers and directors may still differ from the interests of the other stockholders.

Accordingly
 no person should purchase our shares unless willing to entrust all aspects of management to the Officers and Directors
 or their successors. Potential purchasers of our shares must carefully evaluate the personal experience and business abilities of our management.

SINCE WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY
 WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING DIVIDENDS IN THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE AND AS SUCH OUR STOCKHOLDERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECEIVE A RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT UNLESS THEY SELL THEIR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

We do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the near future
 but plan rather to retain earnings
 if any
 for growth and expansion of our business. Unless we pay dividends
 our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them. There is no assurance that stockholders will be able to sell shares when desired.

SINCE WE ARE A NEW COMPANY AND LACK AN OPERATING HISTORY
 WE FACE A HIGH RISK OF BUSINESS FAILURE WHICH WOULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF YOUR INVESTMENT

We are a development stage company formed recently to carry out the activities described in this prospectus and thus has only a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of its prospects can be made. We were incorporated on November 17
 2011 and to date we have been involved primarily in the creation of our business plan and we have transacted no business operations. Thus
 there is no internal or industry-based historical financial data upon which to estimate the company&#8217;s planned operating expenses.

The company expects that its results of operations may also fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of market factors
 including
 among others
 the dominance of other companies offering similar sports nutritional products
 the entry of new competitors into the sports nutritional supplements
 our ability to attract
 retain and motivate qualified personnel
 the initiation
 renewal or expiration of our customer base
 pricing changes by the company or its competitors
 specific economic conditions in the nutritional sports market and general economic conditions. Accordingly
 our future sales and operating results are difficult to forecast.
















BECAUSE WE ARE SMALL AND DO NOT HAVE MUCH CAPITAL
 OUR MARKETING CAMPAIGN AND SALES STRATEGY MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO ATTRACT SUFFICIENT CLIENTS AND PARTNERS TO OPERATE PROFITABLY. IF WE DO NOT MAKE A PROFIT
 WE MAY HAVE TO SUSPEND OR CEASE OPERATIONS

Due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital
 we must limit our marketing and sales activities and may not be able to make our portfolio of sports nutritional products known to potential customers and partners. Because we will be limiting our marketing and sales activities
 we may not be able to attract enough customers and partners to operate profitably. If we cannot operate profitably
 we may have to suspend or cease operations.

AS THE COMPANY&#8217;S OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS HAVE OTHER OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
 THEY MAY NOT BE IN A POSITION TO DEVOTE A MAJORITY OF THEIR TIME TO THE COMPANY
 WHICH MAY RESULT IN PERIODIC INTERRUPTIONS OR BUSINESS FAILURE

Mr. Yisrael Meir Fromer is our President and is a director. Ms. Malka Dahan-Asulin is our Secretary and is a Director. Both Mr. Fromer and Ms. Dahan-Asulin have other business interests and each currently devotes approximately 10-15 hours per week to our operations. Our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are not convenient to either Mr. Fromer or Ms. Dahan-Asulin
 which may result in periodic interruptions or suspensions of our business plan. If the demands of the Company&#8217;s business require the full business time of our&#160;Officers and Directors
 they are prepared to adjust their timetables to devote more time to the Company&#8217;s business. However
 they may not be able to devote sufficient time to the management of the Company&#8217;s business
 which may result in periodic interruptions in implementing the Company&#8217;s plans in a timely manner. Such delays could have a significant negative effect on the success of the business.



The Company is entirely dependent on the efforts of its Officers and Directors. The departure of one or both or&#160;the loss of any other key personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on the business. There is no guarantee that replacement personnel
 if any
 will help the Company to operate profitably. The Company does not maintain key person life insurance on its Officers and Directors.

IT MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO HIRE ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCED PROFESSIONALS
 IF NECESSARY
 AND WE MAY HAVE TO SUSPEND OR CEASE OPERATIONS

Since our management does not have prior experience in the selling of sports nutritional products&#160;for the sports nutritional market
 we may need to hire additional experienced personnel to assist us with the operations. If we need the additional experienced personnel and we cannot hire them
 we could fail in our plan of operations and have to suspend operations or cease them entirely.

Moreover
 as planned
 we anticipate the need of contracting nutritionists to help us in the development of sports nutritional supplements and information concerning the distribution of such sports nutritional products
 as our Officers and Directors have limited experience in this field. If we do not succeed in finding
 contracting or retaining skilled nutritionists and sports enthusiasts
 an important part of our business will be affected
 which may lead to the suspension of our operation or the cession of it completely.

SINCE OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS RESIDE IN ISRAEL
 THE COMPANY MAY FACE SOME DIFFICULTIES DEVELOPING ITS IMPORTING BUSINESS

Since our management&#8217;s residence is in the city of Jerusalem
 in Israel
 their ability to develop relationships with foreign manufactures of sports nutritional products is limited. Due to this fact
 all the contact with our possible suppliers and partners will not be in person and that can negatively affect the results of a partnership or business negotiation. If we cannot establish the proper relationship with our possible suppliers and partners
 our business will fail
 resulting in the total loss of our shareholders investments.


















An important part of our business concept and of revenue generation will rely on our ability to select and retain sports nutritional supplement suppliers. If we are unable to find suitable suppliers and we do not have the ability to have profitable partnerships with them
 our operation would be affected. Therefore
 our operation
 revenue and financial success could be severely affected
 resulting in the suspension of our operation or the cession of it completely.

BECAUSE OUR MANAGEMENT IS INEXPERIENCED IN OPERATING A SPORTS NUTRITION DISTRIBUTION NETWORK
 OUR BUSINESS PLAN MAY FAIL

Our management does not have any specific training in running a business for distributing and&#160;for selling sports nutritional products. With no direct training or experience in this area
 our management may not be fully aware of many of the specific requirements related to working within this industry. As a result
 our management may lack certain skills that are advantageous in managing our company. Consequently
 our operations
 earnings
 and ultimate financial success could suffer irreparable harm due to management&#8217;s lack of experience in this industry.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS NO SPORTS NUTRITIONAL PRODUCTS. WHEN WE DO HAVE SPORTS NUTRITIONAL PRODUCTS OUR NAME WILL HAVE LITTLE
 IF ANY
 NAME RECOGNITION. AS A RESULT
 WE MAY BE UNABLE TO GENERATE REVENUES
 WHICH WILL REDUCE THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT

Because we are a new company with no sports nutritional products and we have not conducted advertising
 there is little or no recognition of our name. As a result
 consumers may search for sports nutritional products other than ours that have brand recognition in the market and we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to meet our expenses or meet our business plan objectives
 which will reduce the value of your investment.

OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS
 ARE LOCATED IN ISRAEL. ANY ATTEMPT TO ENFORCE LIABILITIES UPON THEM UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES AND BANKRUPTCY LAWS MAY BE DIFFICULT.

Since our Officers and Directors
 are located in Israel
 any attempt to enforce liabilities upon such individual under the U.S. securities and bankruptcy laws may be difficult.

In accordance with the Israeli Law on Enforcement of Foreign Judgments
 5718-1958
 and subject to certain time limitations (the application to enforce the judgment must be made within five years of the date of judgment or such other period as might be agreed between Israel and the United States)
 an Israeli court may declare a foreign civil judgment enforceable if it finds that:








the judgment was rendered by a court which was
 according to the laws of the State in which the court is located
 competent to render the judgment;


































































the time the action was instituted in the foreign court
 a suit in the same matter and between the same parties was pending before a court or tribunal in Israel.



















In general
 an obligation imposed by the judgment of a United States court is enforceable according to the rules relating to the enforceability of judgments in Israel
 and a United States court is considered competent to render judgments according to the laws of private international law in Israel.

Furthermore
 Israeli courts may not adjudicate a claim based on a violation of U.S. securities laws if the court determines that Israel is not the most appropriate forum in which to bring such a claim. Even if an Israeli court agrees to hear such a claim
 it may determine that Israeli law
 not U.S. law
 is applicable to the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable
 the content of applicable U.S. law must be proven as a fact
 which can be a time-consuming and costly process.

Since our Directors and Officers do not reside in the United States it may be difficult for courts in the United States to obtain jurisdiction over our foreign assets or persons
 and
 as a result
 it may be difficult or impossible for you to enforce judgments rendered against us or our Directors or Officers in United States courts. Thus
 investing in us may pose a greater risk because should any situation arise in the future in which you have a cause of action against these persons or us
 you may face potential difficulties in bringing lawsuits or
 if successful
 in collecting judgments against these persons or us.



WE ARE AN &#8216;EMERGING GROWTH CONMPANY&#8221; AND WE INTENED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF REDUCED DISCLOSURE AND GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES
 WHICH COULD RESULT IN OUR STOCK BEING LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS.

We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012
 which we refer to as the JOBS Act
 and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including
 but not limited to
 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements
 and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result
 there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We expect to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company
 which in certain circumstances could be for up to five years.



Pursuant to the JOBS Act of 2012
 as an emerging growth company the Company can elect to take advantage of the extended transition period for any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the PCAOB or the SEC.

 can adopt the standard for the private company. This may make comparison of the Company's financial statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as possible different or revised standards may be used.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT&#8217;S COMMON EQUITY
 RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES





There is no established public trading market for our common equity; however
 we are currently engaging a market maker to file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;) to have our common stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board.





As of February 19
 2014
 there were 42 registered stockholders holding 1
032
428 common shares issued and outstanding.





Since our inception
 we have not declared nor paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our current policy is to retain any earnings in order to finance our operations. Our Board of Directors will determine future declarations and payments of dividends
 if any
 in light of the then-current conditions it deems relevant and in accordance with applicable corporate law.











During the fiscal year ended December 31
 2013
 we sold 157
428 shares pursuant to our Registration statement.




During each month within the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31
 2013
 neither we nor any &#8220;affiliated purchaser
&#8221; as that term is defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act
 repurchased any of our common stock or other securities.

























We are a development-stage company
 incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 17
 2011
 as a for-profit company
 and an established fiscal year of December 31. We have not yet generated or realized any revenues from business operations. Our auditor has issued a going concerned opinion. This means there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve (12) months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. Accordingly
 we must raise cash from sources other than our operations and our share sale pursuant to the registration statement in order to implement our marketing plan. In our management&#8217;s opinion
 there is a market for a reasonably-priced sports nutritional supplements.

Our registration went live on April 19
 2013.

From inception through December 31
 2013
 our business operations have primarily been focused on developing our business and researching the market. Through December 31
 2013
 we have spent $26
431 related to corporate operations
 registration of our shares and ordinary business expenses. We have not generated any revenue from business operations. All cash currently held by us is the result of the sale of common stock to our directors and officers and sales pursuant to our public offering.

On December 7
 2011
 the Corporation issued 875
000 shares of common stock to the two directors of the Corporation at a price of $0.016 per share
 for $14
000
 for initial capital (stock subscription receivable). The proceeds from this stock issuance were received on November 14
 2012.


On September 3
 2013
 the Corporation issued 157
428 registered shares of our common stock according to our effective registration statement at a price of $0.25 per share
 for $39
357.&#160;

As of the date of this periodic report
 we have not yet fully implemented our business plan. We expect to continue to conduct required legal and regulatory research and create a detailed market plan in the&#160;1st quarter of 2014. We also expect to finalize our web-site by the 2

We expect to generate revenue from the sale of our sports nutritional supplements. To be successful
 our company needs to accomplish the steps described above
 in order to have a better understanding of the Market and then establish our Marketing strategies. Our company believes that the success of our business relies on the proper execution of the above described plan of operation.

We do not plan to manufacture our product but rather to have as yet unidentified third party suppliers/partners provide us with the sports nutritional supplements under our trade name (or corporate name) and according to our business model. We expected that our product shall be sourced from multiple suppliers/ partners
 which would allow us to possibly always have a supplier nearby our clients
 resulting in faster delivery and fresher ingredients. We plan on establishing a commissioning policy for each supplier/partner. We expect that our suppliers will be able to deliver the products to our clients using their existing structure. If one or all of our suppliers can&#8217;t provide delivery service
 we would have to hire a third party delivery company and
 in this case
 we would charge a delivery fee to our clients. In order to keep the delivery cost down
 we intend to seek for several clients who live in the same area
 so
 more deliveries would be made at each time.




For the twelve month period ended December 31
 2013
 we had no revenue. Expenses for the period totaled $26
431 resulting in a net loss of $26
431 for the period. For the twelve months period ending December 31
 2012 we had no revenue and operating expenses of $42. Since inception (November 17
 2011) through December 31
 2013 we have had no revenue and total expenses of $26
473.

The expenses for the twelve month period ending December 31
 2013 are mostly associated with professional fees
 start-up costs and filing fees.



















As of December 31
 2013 we had&#160;total assets in the form of cash and&#160;cash equivalents&#160;in the amount of&#160;$29
113 and current liabilities in the amount of $2
229.

Our auditors have issued an explanatory note on our ability to continue as a going concern
 meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from our intended offering and implemented our plan of operations. Our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in our effective registration statement. We must raise additional cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. In the event of the failure to complete our financing we would need to seek capital from other resources such as debt financing
 which may not even be available to us.

Management believes that if subsequent private placements are successful
 we will generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof. However
 additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all
 and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements.



The&#160;sports nutritional supplements&#160;to be sold shall be provided by our suppliers and partners. Our company believes that
 due to the fact that we have not implemented our business plan and have not generated any revenues yet
 it is important to keep the focus on our business plan before starting researching for new products and services
 depending on the results of our plan of operation We also do not expect any significant additions to the number of employees
 as the company intends to hire third party consultants when necessary.

The Company&#8217;s Officers and Directors
 Yisrael Meir Fromer and our Secretary Malka Dahan-Asulin have indicated at this time that they may be willing to provide funds required to maintain the reporting status in the form of a non-secured loan for the next twelve months as the expenses are incurred if no other proceeds are obtained by the Company. However
 there is no contract in place or written agreement securing this agreement. Management believes if the Company cannot maintain its reporting status with the SEC it will have to cease all efforts directed towards the Company. As such
 any investment previously made would be lost in its entirety.



The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect or change on the Company&#8217;s financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term &#8220;off-balance sheet arrangement&#8221; generally means any transaction
 agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the Company is a party
 under which the Company has (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract
 derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit
 liquidity or market risk support for such assets.



Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
 liabilities
 revenues and expenses
 and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and during the applicable periods. We base these estimates on historical experience and on other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could have a material impact on our financial statements.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Lollipop Corporation (&#8220;the Company&#8221;) as of December 31
 2013 and 2012
 and the related statements of operations
 changes in stockholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for the years then ended and for the period from inception (November 17
 2011) through December 31
 2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion
 the financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of Lollipop Corporation as of December 31
 2013 and 2012
 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the periods described above in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements
 the Company is in the development stage
 and has not established any source of revenue to cover its operating costs. As of December 31
 2013
 the Company does not have sufficient working capital and cash resources to meet its planned business objectives. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. Management&#8217;s plan regarding these matters is also described in Note 1 to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Lollipop Corporation is a Delaware corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;)
 incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 17
 2011. The Corporation is in the development stage as defined by Accounting Standards Codification 915 (ASC 915)
 &#8220;Accounting and Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises&#8221;
 the Company is devoting substantially all of its efforts to development of business plans. The business plan of the Corporation is; the distribution of sports nutritional supplements.














The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not established a source of revenue sufficient to cover operating costs. As of December 31
 2013
 the Company has a loss from operations of $26
431 an accumulated deficit of $26
473 and has earned no revenues since inception. The Company intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements
 which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures
 working capital and other cash requirements for the year ending December 31
 2014.


The ability of the Company to emerge from the development stage is dependent upon
 among other things
 obtaining additional financing to continue operations
 and development of its business plan. In response to these problems
 management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings.


These factors
 among others
 raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.








The principal accounting policies are set out below
 these policies have been consistently applied to the period presented
 unless otherwise stated:



Cash and equivalents include investments with initial maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its cash balances at credit-worthy financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250
000.

















Property
 Plant and Equipment
The Company does not own any property
 plant and equipment.



The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC 350-50
 Website Development Costs. All costs incurred during the planning phase of a website are expensed as research and development.


Costs incurred in the development stage
 including the purchase of a domain name
 are capitalized and reviewed annually for impairment.





Once the website is available for use
 the asset will be amortized over its useful life on a straight line basis
 estimated to be 3 years
 and is tested for impairment annually.






The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260
 Earnings Per Share ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the effects of all potential dilutive common shares
 which comprise options granted to employees. As at December 31
 2013
 the Company had no potentially dilutive shares.



Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 740
 &#8220;Income Taxes.&#8221; Under the asset and liability method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (temporary differences). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

 the Company had approximately $26

The federal income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by the IRS
 generally for three years after they are filed.























In September 2006
 the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 &#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221;. The objective of SFAS 157 (ASC 820) is to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and to expand disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 (ASC 820) defines fair value
 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 (ASC 820) applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements.

From time to time
 the director and stockholder of the Company provides advances to the Company for its working capital purposes. These advances bear no interest and are due on demand.



In July 2013
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2013-11: Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward
 a Similar Tax Loss
 or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists. The new guidance requires that unrecognized tax benefits be presented on a net basis with the deferred tax assets for such carryforwards. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15
 2013. We do not expect the adoption of the new provisions to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.




In accordance with ASC 855-10
 Company management reviewed all material events through the date of this report and determined that there are no additional material subsequent events to report.

























Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer&#8217;s management
 including the principal executive and principal financial officer
 or persons performing similar functions
 as appropriate
 to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Any controls and procedures
 no matter how well designed and operated
 can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.

We have carried out an evaluation
 under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report.


Based on that evaluation
 our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.




Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
 as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This annual report does not include a report of management's assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting due to a transition period established by rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission for newly public companies.





There were no significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our fourth fiscal quarter
 that could materially affect
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.
























ITEM 10. DIRECTORS
 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE


Our Directors hold office until the next annual general meeting of the stockholders or until their successors are elected and qualified. Our officers are appointed by our Board of Directors and hold office until the earlier of their death
 retirement
 resignation
 or removal.









































President
 Treasurer
 Chief Financial Officer


































The person named above has held his or her offices/positions since December 5
 2011 and is expected to hold his or her offices/positions at least until the next annual meeting of our stockholders.



Since 2010 to present Mr. Fromer has been employed at Access Credit Ltd.
&#160;a foreign exchange company. His responsibilities include financial management
 purchasing and selling of foreign currencies
 and daily management of the facility. From 2001-2009 Mr. Fromer managed a youth organization for underprivileged children. His responsibilities included managing several facilities where underprivileged youth would arrive after school to do homework
 sports
 receive support and eat hot meals. While there he managed budget
 logistics
 oversight of mentors and planning for the daily/weekly activities.




Mrs. Dahan has worked as a teacher since 2007. Since 2010 to present she has focused on her hobby
 music
 and has headed up the schools music department. As part of her teaching career Mrs. Dahan has been responsible for educating classes six through eighth grade
 although early in her teaching career he pupils were four to six year old children. Mrs. Dahan has completed studies with Dr. Miriam Ahdhan and she completed her studies at the Old Seminar of Bet-Jacob.




We do not presently have a separately constituted audit committee
 compensation committee
 nominating committee
 executive committee or any other committees of our Board of Directors. As such
 our entire Board of Directors acts as our audit committee.





Our Board of Directors does not currently have any member who qualifies as an audit committee financial expert. We believe that the cost related to retaining such a financial expert at this time is prohibitive. Further
 because we are in the start-up stage of our business operations
 we believe the services of an audit committee financial expert are not warranted at this time.



















None of our Directors
 nominee for Directors
 or officers has appeared as a party during the past ten years in any legal proceedings that may bear on his ability or integrity to serve as a Director or officer of the Company.





The Company has chosen to combine the principal executive officer and Board chairman positions. The Company believes that this Board leadership structure is the most appropriate for the Company for the following reasons. First
 the Company is a development stage company and at this early stage it is more efficient to have the leadership of the Board in the same hands as the principal executive officer of the Company. The challenges faced by the Company at this stage &#8211; obtaining financing and performing research and development activities &#8211; are most efficiently dealt with by having one person intimately familiar with both the operational aspects as well as the strategic aspects of the Company&#8217;s business. Second
 Mr. Shalom is uniquely suited to fulfill both positions of responsibility because he possesses management experience
 technical experience
 and financial experience.




Since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent Directors
 the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our Board of Directors. Thus
 there is a potential conflict of interest in that our Directors have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation
 in essence their own
 and audit issues that may affect management decisions. We are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executives or Directors.



The Board assesses on an ongoing basis the risks faced by the Company. These risks include financial
 technological
 competitive
 and operational risks. The Board dedicates time at each of its meetings to review and consider the relevant risks faced by the Company at that time. In addition
 since the Company does not have an Audit Committee
 the Board is also responsible for the assessment and oversight of the Company&#8217;s financial risk exposures.





We have not paid
 nor do we owe
 any compensation to our executive officers for the year ending December 31
 2013. From inception through December 31
 2013
 we have not paid any compensation to our officers.


As of December 31
 2013
 we had no employment agreements with any of our executive officers or employees.





We do not currently have a stock option plan. No individual grants of stock options
 whether or not in tandem with stock appreciation rights known as SARs or freestanding SARs have been made to any executive officer or any Director since our inception; accordingly
 no stock options have been granted or exercised by any of the officers or Directors since we were founded.




















We do not have any long-term incentive plans that provide compensation intended to serve as incentive for performance. No individual grants or agreements regarding future payouts under non-stock price-based plans have been made to any executive officer or any Director or any employee or consultant since our inception; accordingly
 no future payouts under non-stock price-based plans or agreements have been granted or entered into or exercised by any of the officers or Directors or employees or consultants since we were founded.








Employment Contracts
 Termination of Employment
 Change-in-Control Arrangements


As of December 31
 2013
 there were no employment or other contracts or arrangements with officers or Directors. There are no compensation plans or arrangements
 including payments to be made by us
 with respect to our officers
 Directors or consultants that would result from the resignation
 retirement or any other termination of such Directors

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
 AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.


Except as disclosed below
 since the beginning of the fiscal year preceding the last fiscal year none of the following persons has had any direct or indirect material interest in any transaction to which our Company was or is a party
 or in any proposed transaction to which our Company proposes to be a party:































any person who beneficially owns
 directly or indirectly
 shares carrying more than 5 percent of the voting rights attached to our common stock; or










any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons (including a spouse
 parents
 children
 siblings
 and in-laws).





On December 7
 2011
 we issued a total of 875
000 shares of common stock to Mr. Yisrael Meir Fromer and Ms. Malka Dahan-Auslin
 our Officers and Directors
 for total cash consideration of $14
000. The Company believes that this issuance was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933
 as amended
 as a transaction by an issuer not involving any public offering. We believe this issuance was deemed to be exempt under Regulation S of the Securities Act. No advertising or general solicitation was employed in offering the securities. The offering and sale was made only to Mr. Yisrael Meir Fromer and Ms. Malka Dahan-Auslin
 who are non-U.S. citizens
 and transfer was restricted by us in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.






















We are not subject to listing requirements of any national securities exchange or national securities association and
 as a result
 we are not at this time required to have our board comprised of a majority of &#8220;independent Directors.&#8221; We do not believe that either of our directors currently meets the definition of &#8220;independent&#8221; as promulgated by the rules and regulations of NASDAQ.

 there were no fees billed for assurance and related services by the principal accountant that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under Item 9(e)(1) of Schedule 14A

 tax advice
 and tax planning
 for products and services provided by the principal accountant
 other than the services reported in Item 9(e)(1) through 9(d)(3) of Schedule 14A.



Given the small size of our Board as well as the limited activities of our Company
 our Board of Directors acts as our Audit Committee. Our Board pre-approves all audit and permissible non-audit services. These services may include audit services
 audit-related services
 tax services
 and other services. Our Board approves these services on a case-by-case basis.

The
principal accounting policies are set out below
 these policies have been consistently applied to the period presented
 unless
otherwise stated:

Cash
and cash equivalents
Cash
and equivalents include investments with initial maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its cash balances at
credit-worthy financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#34;FDIC&#34;) up to $250
000.

Property
Plant and Equipment
The
Company does not own any property
 plant and equipment.

Intellectual
Properties
The
Company has adopted the provisions of ASC 350-50
 Website Development Costs. All costs incurred during the planning phase of a
website are expensed as research and development.

Costs
incurred in the development stage
 including the purchase of a domain name
 are capitalized and reviewed annually for impairment.

Expenses
subsequent to the launch will be expensed as research and development expenses. The Company will expense upgrades and revisions
to its website as incurred.

Once
the website is available for use
 the asset will be amortized over its useful life on a straight line basis
 estimated to be 3
years
 and is tested for impairment annually.

Accounts
payable and accrued expenses
Accounts
payable and accrued expenses are carried at amortized cost and represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company
prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid and arise when the Company becomes obliged to make future payments in respect
of the purchase of these goods and services.

Earnings
per share
The
Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260
 &#34;Earnings Per Share&#34; ASC 260 requires presentation of
both basic and diluted earnings per share (&#147;EPS&#148;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is calculated by
dividing the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders and
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the effects of all potential dilutive common shares
 which comprise
options granted to employees. As at December 31
 2013
 the Company had no potentially dilutive shares.

Income
taxes
Income
taxes are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 740
 &#147;Income Taxes.&#148; Under the asset and liability method
 deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (temporary differences). Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered
or settled. Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that some portion or
all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Lollipop
Corporation is a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Corporation&#148;)
 incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on
November 17
 2011. The Corporation is in the development stage as defined by Accounting Standards Codification 915 (ASC 915)
&#147;Accounting and Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises&#148;
 the Company is devoting substantially all of its efforts
to development of business plans. The business plan of the Corporation is; the distribution of sports nutritional supplements.

Basis
of Presentation
The
Company maintains its accounting records on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;).

These
financial statements are presented in US dollars.

Fiscal
Year End
The
Corporation has adopted a fiscal year end of December 31.

Going
concern
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates
the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not established
a source of revenue sufficient to cover operating costs. As of December 31
 2013
 the Company has a loss from operations of $26
431
an accumulated deficit of $26
473 and has earned no revenues since inception. The Company intends to fund operations through equity
financing arrangements
 which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures
 working capital and other cash requirements
for the year ending December 31
 2014.

The
ability of the Company to emerge from the development stage is dependent upon
 among other things
 obtaining additional financing
to continue operations
 and development of its business plan. In response to these problems
 management intends to raise additional
funds through public or private placement offerings.

These
factors
 among others
 raise substantial doubt about the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts or revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

In
September 2006
 the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 &#147;Fair Value Measurements&#148;. The objective of SFAS 157 (ASC 820) is to
increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and to expand disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS
157 (ASC 820) defines fair value
 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 (ASC 820) applies under other accounting pronouncements that require
or permit fair value measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements.

The
Company has various financial instruments that must be measured under the new fair value standard including: cash in bank. The
Company currently does not have non-financial assets or non-financial liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value
on a recurring basis. The Company&#146;s financial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from the three levels of
the fair value hierarchy. The three levels are as follows:

-
Level 1:&#160;&#160;Quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments;
-
Level 2:&#160; Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments);
-
Level 3:&#160; Significant unobservable inputs (including assumptions in determining the fair value of certain investments).

Financial
assets and liabilities carried at fair value and measured on a recurring basis are classified in the hierarchy as follows:

The Company provided a valuation allowance
    equal to the deferred income tax assets for period ended December 31
 2013 because it is not presently known whether future
    taxable income will be sufficient to utilize the loss carryforwards.

    

As of December 31
 2013
 the Company
    had approximately $26
473 in tax loss carryforwards that can be utilized future periods to reduce taxable income
 and expire
    by the year 2033.

    

The Company did not identify any material
    uncertain tax positions. The Company did not recognize any interest or penalties for unrecognized tax benefits.

    

The federal income tax returns of the
    Company are subject to examination by the IRS
 generally for three years after they are filed.

In
July 2013
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;)
No. 2013-11: Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward
 a Similar Tax Loss
 or a Tax
Credit Carryforward Exists. The new guidance requires that unrecognized tax benefits be presented on a net basis with the deferred
tax assets for such carryforwards. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning
after December 15
 2013. We do not expect the adoption of the new provisions to have a material impact on our financial condition
or results of operations.





        
          

        
          
            

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    








        
          

        
          
            
                
              
                
              

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    





















    
  
      

          

        

      






        
        


        
The
Company maintains its accounting records on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;).

These
financial statements are presented in US dollars.



        
The
Corporation has adopted a fiscal year end of December 31.



        
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates
the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not established
a source of revenue sufficient to cover operating costs. As of December 31
 2013
 the Company has a loss from operations of $26
431
an accumulated deficit of $26
473 and has earned no revenues since inception. The Company intends to fund operations through equity
financing arrangements
 which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures
 working capital and other cash requirements
for the year ending December 31
 2014.

The
ability of the Company to emerge from the development stage is dependent upon
 among other things
 obtaining additional financing
to continue operations
 and development of its business plan. In response to these problems
 management intends to raise additional
funds through public or private placement offerings.

These
factors
 among others
 raise substantial doubt about the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.



        
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts or revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.



        
Cash
and equivalents include investments with initial maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its cash balances at
credit-worthy financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#34;FDIC&#34;) up to $250
000.


Property
 plant and equipment
The
Company does not own any property
 plant and equipment.


        
The
Company has adopted the provisions of ASC 350-50
 Website Development Costs. All costs incurred during the planning phase of a
website are expensed as research and development.

Costs
incurred in the development stage
 including the purchase of a domain name
 are capitalized and reviewed annually for impairment.

Expenses
subsequent to the launch will be expensed as research and development expenses. The Company will expense upgrades and revisions
to its website as incurred.

Once
the website is available for use
 the asset will be amortized over its useful life on a straight line basis
 estimated to be 3
years
 and is tested for impairment annually.



        
Accounts
payable and accrued expenses are carried at amortized cost and represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company
prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid and arise when the Company becomes obliged to make future payments in respect
of the purchase of these goods and services.



        
The
Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260
 &#34;Earnings Per Share&#34; ASC 260 requires presentation of
both basic and diluted earnings per share (&#147;EPS&#148;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is calculated by
dividing the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders and
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the effects of all potential dilutive common shares
 which comprise
options granted to employees. As at December 31
 2013
 the Company had no potentially dilutive shares.


        
Income
taxes are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 740
 &#147;Income Taxes.&#148; Under the asset and liability method
 deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (temporary differences). Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered
or settled. Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that some portion or
all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
