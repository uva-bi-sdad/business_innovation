 references to key markets where we operate and the market for our securities. These forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses we make in light of our experience and our interpretation of current conditions
 historical trends and expected future developments
Whether actual results and developments will agree with our expectations and predictions is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly
 there are or will be important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations and predictions. We believe these factors include
 but are not limited to
we could face intense competition
we have a limited operating history and if we are not successful in growing our business
if our intellectual property is not adequately protected
if we are the subject of an intellectual property infringement claim
we could lose our competitive advantages if we are not able to protect any of our food and nutritional products and intellectual property rights against infringement
if we do not introduce new products or make enhancements to adequately meet the changing needs of our customers
 some of our products could fail in the marketplace
 which could negatively impact our revenues
we are affected by laws and governmental regulations with potential penalties or claims
since we rely on independent third parties for the manufacture and supply of certain of our products
 if these third parties fail to reliably supply products to us at required levels of quality and which are manufactured in compliance with applicable laws
we may incur material product liability claims
unless we can generate sufficient cash from operations or additional raise funds
if we do not manage our supply chain effectively
our stock price may be volatile
our common shares are thinly traded and our shareholders may be unable to sell at or near ask prices
the market price for our common stock is particularly volatile given our status as a relatively small and developing company
 which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. Our shareholders may be unable to sell their common stock at or above their purchase price if at all
the elimination of monetary liability against our directors
 officers and employees under Nevada law and the existence of indemnification rights of our directors
 officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by our company and may discourage lawsuits against our directors
Consequently all forward-looking statements made herein are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that our actual results or the developments we anticipate will be realized. The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this report. For a more detailed discussion of the principal factors that could cause actual results to be materially different

 supply chain and products are subject to a wide range of governmental regulations and policies in various regions where we operate
 including the U.S. and Canada. These laws
 regulations and policies are implemented
 as applicable in each jurisdiction

Human Resources
 Contract Service Providers
We operate our business via resources that provide services to the Company on a contractual basis. We feel this is most prudent as we can cost effectively meet our needs and leverage capabilities of talented individuals without employing on a full time basis. As the business grows we expect to add a number of full-time employees. We presently do not have pension
 health
 annuity
 insurance
 profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however
 we may adopt such plans in the future. Except for our stock option plan
We provide an annual report that includes audited financial information to our shareholders. We will make our financial information equally available to any interested parties or investors through compliance with the disclosure rules of Regulation S-K for a small business issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We are subject to disclosure filing requirements
 including filing Form 10K annually and Form 10Q quarterly. In addition
 we will file Form 8K and other proxy and information statements from time to time as required. We do not intend to voluntarily file the above reports in the event that our obligation to file such reports is suspended under the Exchange Act. The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission
 (&#8220;SEC&#8221;)
 at the SEC&#8217;s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street NE
 Washington
 DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports
 proxy and information statements
You should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this report before making an investment decision with regard to our securities. The statements contained in or incorporated into this current report on Form 10-K that are not historic facts are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually occur
 our business
 financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. In that case
 the trading price of our common stock could decline
We have yet to establish a history of profitable operations and
 as at November 30
 2019
 have an accumulated deficit of $34
225
630
 realized since our inception on November 5
We could face intense competition
Unless we keep pace with changing market demands
 we could lose existing customers and more importantly fail to win new and retain any future customers. In order to compete effectively in the food and nutritional products industry
 we must continually design
 develop implement and market new and/or enhanced products and strategies. Our future success will depend
 in part
Further
Success depends on the acquisition of key personnel. We will have to compete with other companies both within and outside the food and nutritional products industry to recruit and retain competent employees and contract resources. If we cannot maintain qualified resources to meet the needs of our anticipated growth
Our business may experience periods of rapid change and/or growth that could place significant demands on our personnel
 operating and financial resources. To manage possible growth and change
 our business
There can be no assurance that we will ever operate profitably. We have a limited operating history. Our success is significantly dependent on the successful marketing and sales of our food and nutritional products
 which cannot be guaranteed. Our operations will be subject to all the risks inherent in the uncertainties arising from the absence of a significant operating history. We may be unable profitably sell our food and nutritional products and thus operate on a profitable basis. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by enterprises in the development stage. If our business plan is not successful
 and we are not able to operate profitably
If our intellectual property is not adequately protected
Our commercial success may depend
 in part
 on obtaining and maintaining patent protection
 trade secret protection and regulatory protection of our technologies and products as well as successfully defending third-party challenges to such technologies and products. We will be able to protect our technologies and product from use by third parties only to the extent that valid and enforceable patents
 trade secrets or regulatory protection cover them and we have exclusive rights to use them. The ability of our licensors
 collaborators and suppliers to maintain their patent rights against third-party challenges to their validity
The patent positions of technology related companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions that include unresolved principles and issues. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed regarding such companies&#8217; patents has emerged to date in the United States
 and the patent situation outside the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States or other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly
We may also rely on trade secrets to protect our technologies
 especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However
 trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we seek to protect confidential information
 in part
 through confidentiality agreements with our employees
 consultants and scientific and other advisors
 they may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim against a third party related to the illegal acquisition and use of trade secrets can be expensive and time consuming
 and the outcome is often unpredictable. If we are not able to maintain patent or trade secret protection on our technologies and products
 then we may not be able to exclude competitors from developing or marketing competing products
If we are the subject of an intellectual property infringement claim
There has been
 and we believe that there will continue to be
 significant litigation and demands for licenses in our industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Although we anticipate having a valid defense to any allegation that our current products
 production methods and other activities infringe the valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of any third parties
 we cannot be certain that a third party will not challenge our position in the future. Other parties may own patent rights that we might infringe with our products or other activities
 and our competitors or other patent holders may assert that our products and the methods we employ are covered by their patents. These parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial litigation expenses and
 if successful
 may require us to pay substantial damages. Some of our potential competitors may be better able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation
 and depending on the circumstances
 we could be forced to stop or delay our research
 development
our food and nutritional products and intellectual property rights against infringement
Our success and ability to compete depends to a significant degree on our licenses and the ability to use our food and nutritional products. If any of our competitor&#8217;s copies or otherwise gains access to any of our competitive advantages or develops similar products independently
We also consider our assigned trademarks invaluable to our ability to continue to develop and maintain the goodwill and recognition associated with our brands. These and any other measures that we may take to protect our intellectual property rights
 which presently are based upon a combination of copyright
 trade secret and trademark laws
Further
 the laws of foreign countries may provide inadequate protection of such intellectual property rights. We may need to bring legal claims to enforce or protect such intellectual property rights. Any litigation
 whether successful or unsuccessful
 could result in substantial costs and diversions of resources. In addition
 notwithstanding any rights we have secured in our intellectual property
 other persons may bring claims against us that we have infringed on their intellectual property rights
 including claims based upon the content we license from third parties or claims that our intellectual property right interests are not valid. Any claims against us
 with or without merit
 could be time consuming and costly to defend or litigate
 divert our attention and resources
As we proceed with the commercialization of our portfolio
 we expect to experience significant and rapid growth in the scope and complexity of our business. We will need to add resources to market our services
 manage operations
 handle sales and marketing efforts and perform finance and accounting functions. We will be required to hire a broad range of additional personnel in order to successfully advance our operations. This growth is likely to place a strain on our management and operational resources. The failure to develop and implement effective systems
 or to hire and retain sufficient personnel for the performance of all of the functions necessary to effectively service and manage our potential business
 or the failure to manage growth effectively
Our industry is characterized by rapid changes in market demands. As a result
 our products may quickly become obsolete and unmarketable. Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to and anticipate market demands
 develop new products and enhance our current products on a timely and cost-effective basis. Further
 our products must remain competitive with those of other companies with substantially greater resources. We may experience technical or other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development
 introduction or marketing of new products or enhanced versions of existing products. Also
Our business is subject to changing consumer trends and preferences. Our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes
If we do not introduce new products or make enhancements to adequately meet the changing needs of our customers
 some of our products could fail in the marketplace
 which could negatively impact our revenues
The business of marketing of food and nutritional products is highly competitive and sensitive to the introduction of new products
 including various prescription drugs
 which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market. These market segments include numerous manufacturers
 distributors
 marketers
We are affected by laws and governmental regulations with potential penalties or claims
The formulation
 manufacturing
 packaging
 labeling
 distribution
 advertising
 licensing
New regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may negatively impact the marketing of our products
 resulting in loss of revenues. We are subject to FDA rules for current good manufacturing practices
 or GMPs
 for the manufacture
 packing
If these supply partners fail to comply with the GMPs and regulations
Since we rely on independent third parties for the manufacture and supply of certain of our products
 if these third parties fail to reliably supply products to us at required levels of quality and which are manufactured in compliance with applicable laws
We cannot be assured that our outside contract manufacturers will continuously
 reliably supply products to us at the levels of quality
 or the quantities
 we require
 and in compliance with applicable laws
 including under the FDA&#8217;s GMP regulations. Additionally
 while we are not presently aware of any current liquidity issues with our suppliers
We may incur material product liability claims
We rely upon published and unpublished safety information including clinical studies on ingredients used in our products. Previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of these ingredients could occur. As a marketer of dietary and nutritional supplements and other products that are ingested by consumers or applied to their bodies
 we may be subjected to various product liability claims
 including that the products contain contaminants
 the products include inadequate instructions as to their uses
 or the products include inadequate warnings concerning side effects and interactions with other substances. It is possible that widespread product liability claims could increase our costs
 and adversely affect our revenues and operating income. Moreover
 liability claims arising from a serious adverse event may increase our costs through higher insurance premiums and deductibles
Many of our customers buy from us under purchase orders
 and we generally do not have long-term agreements with or commitments from these customers for the purchase of products. We cannot provide assurance that our customers will maintain or increase their sales volumes or orders for the products supplied by us or that we will be able to maintain or add to our existing customer base. Decreases in our customers&#8217; sales volumes or orders for products supplied by us may have a material adverse effect on our business
If we do not manage our supply chain effectively
Our supply chain is complex. We rely on suppliers for our raw materials and for the manufacturing
 processing
 packaging and distribution of many of our products. The inability of any of these suppliers to deliver or perform for us in a timely or cost-effective manner could cause our operating costs to rise and our margins to fall. We must continuously monitor our inventory and product mix against forecasted demand or risk having inadequate supplies to meet consumer demand as well as having too much inventory that may reach its expiration date. If we are unable to manage our supply chain efficiently and ensure that our products are available to meet consumer demand
Our stock price may be volatile
The stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations
 and the market prices of companies listed on the OTCQB quotation system in which shares of our common stock are listed
 have been volatile in the past and have experienced sharp share price and trading volume changes. The trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to many factors
 including the following
changes in expectations of our future financial performance
Domestic and international stock markets often experience significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations
 as well as general economic and political conditions unrelated to our performance
Our common shares are thinly traded and our shareholders may be unable to sell at or near ask prices
This situation is attributable to a number of factors
 including the fact that we are a small company in its development phase which is relatively unknown to stock analysts
 stock brokers
 institutional investors and others in the investment community who generate or influence sales volume. Even if we came to the attention of such persons
 those persons may be reluctant to follow
 purchase
 or recommend the purchase of shares of an unproven company such as ours until such time as we become more seasoned and viable. As a consequence
 there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent
 as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous trades without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot be assured that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained
The market price for our common stock is particularly volatile given our status as a relatively small and developing company
 which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. Our shareholders may be unable to sell your common stock at or above your purchase price if at all
Shareholders should be aware that
 according to SEC Release No. 34-29093
 the market for penny stock/over the counter stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (1) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (2) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (3) boiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (4) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (5) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level
We presently do not anticipate that we will pay dividends on any of our common stock in the foreseeable future. If payment of dividends does occur at some point in the future
 it would be contingent upon our revenues and earnings
 if any
 capital requirements
 and general financial condition. The payment of any common stock dividends will be within the discretion of our Board of Directors. We presently intend to retain all earnings to implement our business plan; accordingly
Our common stock is currently quoted on the OTCQB. We must comply with numerous NASDAQ MarketPlace rules in order to maintain the listing of our common stock on the OTCQB. There can be no assurance that we can continue to meet the requirements to maintain the quotation on the OTCQB listing of our common stock. If we are unable to maintain our listing on the OTCQB
The market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility as compared to seasoned issuers
 and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past
 plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may
 in the future
The elimination of monetary liability against our directors
 officers and employees under Nevada law and the existence of indemnification rights of our directors
 officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by our company and may discourage lawsuits against our directors
Our Articles of Incorporation contains a specific provision that eliminates the liability of our directors and officers for monetary damages to our company and shareholders. Further
 we are prepared to give such indemnification to our directors and officers to the extent provided for by Nevada law. We may also have contractual indemnification obligations under our employment agreements with our officers. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in our company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers
 which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage our company from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties
 and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our shareholders against our directors and officers even though such actions
 if successful
Because our common stock is publicly traded
 we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal
 state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities
 including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
 the SEC and FINRA
 have issued requirements and regulations and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate scandals and laws enacted by Congress
 most notably the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in
 and are likely to continue resulting in
 increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Because new and modified laws
 regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity
We do not currently own any property and we currently have no investment policies as they pertain to real estate

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. For the foreseeable future
 we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business

The Company&#8217;s shares are covered by Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended that imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally institutions with assets in excess of $5
000
000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1
000
000 or annual income exceeding $200
000 or $300
000 jointly with their spouses). For transactions covered by the Rule
 the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase and have received the purchaser&#8217;s written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently
Section 15(g) also imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell penny securities. These rules require a one page summary of certain essential items. The items include the risk of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary marketing; terms important to in understanding of the function of the penny stock market
 such as &#8220;bid&#8221; and &#8220;offer&#8221; quotes

 or other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. To the extent any forward-looking statements contain future-oriented financial information or financial outlooks
 such information is being provided to enable a reader to assess our financial condition
 material changes in our financial condition
 our results of operations
 and our liquidity and capital resources. Readers are cautioned that this information may not be appropriate for any other purpose
Forward-looking statements contained in this MD&amp;A are based on certain factors and assumptions regarding expected growth
 results of operations
 performance
 and business prospects and opportunities. While we consider these assumptions to be reasonable
 based on information currently available
 they may prove to be incorrect. Forward-looking statements are also subject to certain factors
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
 related revenues and expenses
Inventory is our largest current asset other than cash and consists primarily of raw materials and finished goods held for sale. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
 measured on a first-in
 first out basis
 or estimated net realizable value. In order to determine the value of inventory at the balance sheet date
 we evaluate a number of factors to determine the adequacy of provisions for inventory. These factors include the age of inventory
 the amount of inventory held by type
 future demand for products
 and the expected future selling price we expect to realize by selling the inventory. Our estimates are judgmental in nature and are made at a point in time
 using available information
 expected business plans
 and expected market conditions. As a result
We review our long-lived assets
 to include intangible assets subject to amortization
 for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets (collectively referred to as &#8220;the asset&#8221;) may not be recoverable. Such circumstances include
a current expectation that
 more likely than not
We continually evaluate whether such events and circumstances have occurred. When such events or circumstances exist
 the recoverability of the asset&#8217;s carrying value shall be determined by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows (cash inflows less associated cash outflows) that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset. To date
 no such impairment has occurred. To the extent such events or circumstances occur that could affect the recoverability of our long-lived assets
We recognize revenue at the time of delivery of the product and when all of the following have occurred: a sales agreement is in place; the performance obligations of the agreement has been identified; the transaction price has been determined; the transaction price has been allocated to the performance obligations; and when each performance obligation is satisfied. Agreed trading terms with customers such as value incentives
 rebates
We maintain a stock incentive plan under which stock options and other stock-based awards may be granted to selected officer
 directors and service providers. For grants of stock options
 we are required to estimate a number of inputs at each grant date
 such as the estimated life of the option
 future stock price volatility
 and the forfeiture rate used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine a fair value for the options granted to employees or non-employee directors. Once determined at the grant date
We are liable for income taxes in jurisdictions where we operate. Our effective tax rate may differ from the statutory tax rate and will vary from year to year primarily as a result of any permanent differences
 investment and other tax credits
 as well as the provision for income taxes at different rates in various jurisdictions. In making an estimate of our income tax liability
 we first assess which items of income and expense are taxable in a particular jurisdiction. This process involves a determination of the amount of taxes currently payable as well as the assessment of the effect of temporary timing differences resulting from different treatment of items for accounting and tax purposes. These differences in the timing of the recognition of income or the deductibility of expenses may result in deferred income tax balances that are recorded as assets or liabilities as the case may be on our balance sheet. We also estimate the amount of valuation allowance to maintain relating to loss carry forwards and other balances that can be used to reduce future taxes payable. We assess the likelihood of the ultimate realization of these tax assets by looking at the relative size of the tax assets in relation to the profitability of the businesses and the jurisdiction to which they can be applied

The decrease was the result of the Company&#8217;s implementation of a strategic shift away from established commodity-based private label product sales to developing high-margin premium branded product sales in the period. This transition resulted in a 24% increase in gross profit to $429

 2019 and interest rate was increased from 6% per annum to 8% per annum. The convertible debentures are convertible into shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock at an initial conversion price of $0.71 per share for an aggregate of up to 3

On September 26
 2016
 we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with a non-US institutional investor pursuant to which
 in consideration for proceeds of $4
100

 we issued a secured convertible promissory note in the amount of $4
100
000. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement
 the investor has agreed
 from time to time after January 1

 to make additional investments at our request of up to $5

000 in the aggregate) in one or more tranches of not less than one tranche during any 60 day period. The funding of any tranche under the agreement (other than the first $4
100
000 which has been funded) is subject to the mutual agreement of the parties as to the use of funds. The parties have agreed to negotiate in good faith to pre-approve use of funds within 120 days following September 26
 2016. On May 9

 settlement of accounts payable and repayment of mature loans. In consideration of each advance made by the investor pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement
 we will issue to the investor a convertible promissory note of equal value
 maturing three years after issuance
 and bearing interest at the rate of 8% per annum. Each note will be secured in first priority against the present and after acquired assets of the Company
 and will be convertible in whole or in part at the option of the holder into common shares of the Company at a conversion price per share of $.60
On November 30

 subject to certain terms and conditions. Each portion of the principal amount advanced pursuant to the 2018 Convertible Note will bear interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum and will be payable monthly in arrears to Fengate. Outstanding principal and interest will continue to be secured by the general security agreement dated September 26
 2016
 which forms a part of the Agreement. The holder of the note may also elect from time to time to convert all or a portion of the outstanding principal and interest into common shares of the Company at a 25% discount to the average closing price of the common shares during the 10 trading days immediately prior to the applicable conversion date. The 2018 Convertible Notes were extended and will mature on December 1

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our principal executive officer and the principal financial officer
 we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934
 as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation
 our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting&#8221;. However
 the material information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our principal executive and financial officer
 recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms relating to our company
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
 as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act
 for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control
 and accordingly
 even effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect material misstatements. In addition
A material weakness is a significant deficiency
 or combination of significant deficiencies
Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
 as of November 30
 2019
 based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on its evaluation under this framework
 management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of November 30
We do not have a financial expert on our audit committee or a fully independent Board of Directors
Management is committed to improving its internal controls and will (1) continue to use third party specialists to address shortfalls in staffing and to assist the Company with accounting and finance responsibilities
Management has discussed the material weakness noted above with our independent registered public accounting firm. Due to the nature of this material weakness
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter for our fiscal year ended November 30
 2019 that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
The following includes a summary of transactions since the beginning of the November 30

We were acting with three directors
 consisting of Mark Holcombe
 Anthony Pallante and Scott Chapman. On February 29
 2020 Mark Holcombe resigned as a director of the company. He will continue to provide business advisory services to the Company. On March 1
 2020 the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors appointed Richard Russell to serve on the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors
 to serve in such capacity until the next annual meeting of stockholders of the Company. In connection with his appointment
 the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors determined that Mr. Russell would meet the requirements of an &#8220;independent director&#8221; under the Nasdaq Stock Market&#8217;s corporate governance rules. Accordingly
 the Board of Directors has designated Mr. Russell an &#8220;independent director&#8221; for corporate governance purposes. The Company intends to expand its Board of Directors and appoint additional &#8220;independent directors
We have an Audit Committee
However
 all of the members of the committees are not independent. We believe that our board of directors is capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. The board of directors of our company does not believe that it is necessary to have a completely independent audit
 compensation or corporate governance committee at this time because we believe that the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by the existing board of directors. Additionally
The total fees charged to the company for audit services were $61
300 and for other services were $Nil during the year ended November 30
The total fees charged to the company for audit services were $58
500 and for other services were $Nil during the year ended November 30
In accordance with Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
 the registrant caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned
March 16
(CEO
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Trident Brands Incorporated and its subsidiaries (collectively
 the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of November 30
 2019 and 2018
 and the related consolidated statements of operations
 changes in stockholders&#8217; deficit
 and cash flows for the years then ended
 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion
 the financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of November 30
 2019 and 2018
 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management

The Company is now focused on the development of high growth branded and private label consumer products and ingredients within the nutritional supplement

The Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements as of November 30

 Sports Nutrition Products Inc.
 Brain Armor Inc.
The Company follows the guidance in ASC No. 260
 &#8220;Earnings Per Share&#8221;
 which specifies the computation
Basic net earnings (loss) per share amounts are computed by dividing the net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Due to net losses during the years ended November 30
 2019 and 2018
November 30
Accounts receivable are recorded at their original invoice amounts. We regularly review collectability and establish an allowance for uncollectible amounts as necessary. As of November 30
 2019 and 2018
 the Company&#8217;s accounts receivable was netted against an allowance of $55
979 and $32
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is principally determined using the first-in

Our cost method investment consists of an investment in a private company in which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over its operating and financial activities. The investment is tested for impairment
 at least annually
The Company recognized an impairment on its cost method investment of $440

We review our long-lived assets
 including intangible assets subject to amortization
 for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets (collectively referred to as &#8220;the asset&#8221;) may not be recoverable. Such circumstances include
a current expectation that
 more likely than not
We continually evaluate whether such events and circumstances have occurred. When such events or circumstances exist
November 30
Intangible assets have either an identifiable or indefinite useful life. Intangible assets with identifiable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic or legal life
The intrinsic value of a beneficial conversion feature inherent to a convertible note payable
 which is not bifurcated and accounted for separately from the convertible note payable and may not be settled in cash upon conversion
 is treated as a discount to the convertible note payable. This discount is amortized over the period from the date of issuance to the date the note is due using the effective interest method. If the note payable is retired prior to the end of its contractual term
 the unamortized discount is expensed in the period of retirement to interest expense. In general
 the beneficial conversion feature is measured by comparing the effective conversion price
 after considering the relative fair value of detachable instruments included in the financing transaction
 if any
The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the requirements of FASB ASC 820
 &#8220;Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures&#8221;. ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value
 prescribes methods for measuring fair value
Level 1 &#8211; Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives
Level 2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date and includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions
 including quoted forward prices for commodities
 time value
 volatility factors
 and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments
Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument
 can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity swaps
 interest rate swaps
November 30
The carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. These financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable and note payable. The fair value of the Company&#8217;s long-term debt is estimated based on current rates that would be available for debt of similar terms which is not significantly different from its stated value. As of November 30
 2019 the Company did not have any financial assets or liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis
 except for a derivative liability
 related to the embedded conversion option on the 2018 convertible note
 with a fair value of $5

Fair value accounting requires bifurcation of embedded derivative instruments such as conversion features in convertible debt or equity instruments and measurement of their fair value for accounting purposes. In assessing the convertible debt instruments
 management determines if the convertible debt host instrument is conventional convertible debt and further if there is a beneficial conversion feature requiring measurement. If the instrument is not considered conventional convertible debt under ASC 470

In May 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-12
 Revenue from Contracts from Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. The amendments in this update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09. The core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in ASU 2016-12 do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606
 but instead affect only the narrow aspects noted in Topic 606. Topic 606 became effective for the Company on December 1
In May 2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-09
 Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718)
 Scope of Modification Accounting. The amendments in this Update provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for annual periods
 and interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December 15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in any interim period
 for (1) public business entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued and (2) all other entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been made available for issuance. This became effective December 1
In July 2017
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2017-11
 Earnings Per Share (Topic 260)
 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480)
 Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). The amendments in Part I of this Update change the classification analysis of certain equity-linked financial instruments (or embedded features) with down round features. When determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments
 a down round feature no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity&#8217;s own stock. The amendments also clarify existing disclosure requirements for equity-classified instruments. As a result
 a freestanding equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded conversion option) no longer would be accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value as a result of the existence of a down round feature. For freestanding equity classified financial instruments
 the amendments require entities that present earnings per share (EPS) in accordance with Topic 260 to recognize the effect of the down round feature when it is triggered. That effect is treated as a dividend and as a reduction of income available to common shareholders in basic EPS. Convertible instruments with embedded conversion options that have down round features are now subject to the specialized guidance for contingent beneficial conversion features (in Subtopic 470-20
 Debt&#8212;Debt with Conversion and Other Options)
 including related EPS guidance (in Topic 260). The amendments in Part II of this Update recharacterize the indefinite deferral of certain provisions of Topic 480 that now are presented as pending content in the Codification
 to a scope exception. Those amendments do not have an accounting effect. For public business entities
 the amendments in Part I of this Update are effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December 15
 2018. For all other entities
 the amendments in Part I of this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2020. Early adoption is permitted for all entities
 including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period

In December 2018
 the FASB issued ASC 842 and as ASU 2016-02
 is the new lease accounting standard published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). It replaced the previous US GAAP leasing standard
 ASC 840. The purpose of the new standard is to close a major accounting loophole in ASC 840: off-balance sheet operating leases. Public companies began to implement the standard starting after December 15
 2018. Private companies will follow a year later on December 15
 2020. ASC 842 represents a significant overhaul of the accounting treatment for leases
 with the most significant change being that most leases
 including most operating leases
 are now capitalized on the balance sheet. Under ASC 840
 FASB permitted operating leases to be reported only in the footnotes of corporate financial statements. Under ASC 842
 the only leases that are exempt from the capitalization requirement are short-term leases less than or equal to 12 months in length. This became effective December 1

 a wholly owned subsidiary of Trident International
 to Packaging Lab in consideration of 1

The Company elected to measure the nonmonetary transaction based on the recorded amount of StreamPak using the guidance of ASC No. 845 &#8220;Non Monetary Transactions&#8221; since it was determined that the transaction lacked commercial substance. The investment balance of $440

 the parties have executed applicable trademark assignment and purchase agreements necessary to transfer all global intellectual property rights in the Brain Armor brand to Trident. In lieu of a $400
000 cash payment to DSM for the value of the Brain Armor&#174; brand as initially intended
 the Company agreed to meet certain conditions
 that when satisfied will have an equivalent value of $400
000. The costs incurred to meet these conditions are being charged to intangible assets. As of November 30

The agreement was terminated on December 31
 2017. On January 17
 2019
 Everlast World&#8217;s Boxing Headquarters Corp. (&#8220;Everlast&#8221;) filed a counter civil lawsuit against the Company and other defendants. In that lawsuit
 Everlast seeks payment from the defendants under a License Agreement dated June 4
 2013
 for $425
555 in unpaid royalties allegedly due and owing under the License Agreement and interest on the allegedly unpaid royalties of $96
265
 which interest allegedly continues to accrue. Everlast has also sought all costs
 expenses
 and legal fees incurred by Everlast in collecting monies that it claims are due under the License Agreement. On February 26
 2020
 the court in the Everlast matter issued an Opinion and Order granting a motion to dismiss all of Trident&#8217;s claims against Everlast and granting a motion for judgment on the pleadings as to liability against Trident. The Court left open the question of damages to be awarded to Everlast. Trident has requested that the parties participate in settlement discussions before a magistrate judge or
 in the alternative
 that Everlast engage in limited discovery on these matters. The Company has accrued the unpaid royalties as of November 30
 2019 and 2018 of $425
The Company may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. If any legal matter
 that may arise
 were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management&#8217;s expectations

 the FASB issued ASU 2016-12
 Revenue from Contracts from Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. The amendments in this update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09. The core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in ASU 2016-12 do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606
 but instead affect only the narrow aspects noted in Topic 606. Topic 606 became effective for the Company on December 1

 the FASB issued ASU 2017-09
 Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718)
 Scope of Modification Accounting. The amendments in this Update provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for annual periods
 and interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December 15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in any interim period
 for (1) public business entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued and (2) all other entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been made available for issuance. This became effective December 1

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&amp;#8220;ASU&amp;#8221;) No. 2017-11
 Earnings Per Share (Topic 260)
 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480)
 Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). The amendments in Part I of this Update change the classification analysis of certain equity-linked financial instruments (or embedded features) with down round features. When determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments
 a down round feature no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity&amp;#8217;s own stock. The amendments also clarify existing disclosure requirements for equity-classified instruments. As a result
 a freestanding equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded conversion option) no longer would be accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value as a result of the existence of a down round feature. For freestanding equity classified financial instruments
 the amendments require entities that present earnings per share (EPS) in accordance with Topic 260 to recognize the effect of the down round feature when it is triggered. That effect is treated as a dividend and as a reduction of income available to common shareholders in basic EPS. Convertible instruments with embedded conversion options that have down round features are now subject to the specialized guidance for contingent beneficial conversion features (in Subtopic 470-20
 Debt&amp;#8212;Debt with Conversion and Other Options)
 including related EPS guidance (in Topic 260). The amendments in Part II of this Update recharacterize the indefinite deferral of certain provisions of Topic 480 that now are presented as pending content in the Codification
 to a scope exception. Those amendments do not have an accounting effect. For public business entities
 the amendments in Part I of this Update are effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December 15
 2018. For all other entities
 the amendments in Part I of this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2020. Early adoption is permitted for all entities
 including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period

 the FASB issued ASC 842 and as ASU 2016-02
 is the new lease accounting standard published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). It replaced the previous US GAAP leasing standard
 ASC 840. The purpose of the new standard is to close a major accounting loophole in ASC 840: off-balance sheet operating leases. Public companies began to implement the standard starting after December 15
 2018. Private companies will follow a year later on December 15
 2020. ASC 842 represents a significant overhaul of the accounting treatment for leases
 with the most significant change being that most leases
 including most operating leases
 are now capitalized on the balance sheet. Under ASC 840
 FASB permitted operating leases to be reported only in the footnotes of corporate financial statements. Under ASC 842
 the only leases that are exempt from the capitalization requirement are short-term leases less than or equal to 12 months in length. This became effective December 1


 which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business within one year after the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board

 2017 we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement dated September 6
 2017 among our wholly owned subsidiary
 Trident Brands International Ltd. (&amp;#8220;Trident International&amp;#8221;)
 a Bahamas corporation
 StreamPak Ltd. (&amp;#8220;StreamPak&amp;#8221;)

000 of our common shares valued at $360
000 based on our stock price on September 6
 2017
 Trident International purchased 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares of StreamPak. As a result of the share purchase StreamPak became a wholly owned subsidiary of Trident International. The acquisition was not deemed an acquisition of a business but rather an acquisition of a finite-lived intangible asset. The total consideration of $485
000 was recognized as an intangible asset related to intellectual property with an estimated useful life of 10 years. As of July 31

 our wholly owned subsidiary
 Trident International
 entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Packaging Lab SAS (&amp;#8220;Packaging Lab&amp;#8221;)
 whereby Trident International sold all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of StreamPak
 a wholly owned subsidiary of Trident International
 to Packaging Lab in consideration of 1
000 common shares representing 10% of fully diluted shares in Packaging Innovation Lab. The investment in Packaging Lab was recorded using the cost method of accounting. The Company elected to measure the nonmonetary transaction based on the recorded amount of StreamPak using the guidance of ASC No. 845 &amp;#8220;Non Monetary Transactions&amp;#8221; since it was determined that the transaction lacked commercial substance. The investment balance of $440
542 was fully impaired as of November 30


 2017 the Company entered into a note purchase agreement with Fengate Trident LP (&amp;#8220;Fengate&amp;#8221;) pursuant to which
 in consideration for the issuance of 811

 we purchased outstanding secured convertible promissory notes of Mycell Technologies LLC having an aggregate balance due and payable of $511
141 in principal and $94

 which were originally issued to LPF (MCTECH) Investment Corp. on January 22
 2016
 February 5
 2016
 and May 19
 2016
 bear simple interest on unpaid principal at the rate of ten percent per annum. The outstanding principal and accrued interest is convertible at the option of the note holder into securities of Mycell. The accrued interest as at November 30
 2018 is $105

 Trident exercised its option under our Exclusive License Agreement (dated March 1
 2015) to purchase the Brain Armor&amp;#174; brand from DSM Nutrition Products LLC (&amp;#8220;DSM&amp;#8221;). Subsequently
 the parties have executed applicable trademark assignment and purchase agreements necessary to transfer all global intellectual property rights in the Brain Armor brand to Trident. In lieu of a $400
000 cash payment to DSM for the value of the Brain Armor&amp;#174; brand as initially intended
 the Company agreed to meet certain conditions
 that when satisfied will have an equivalent value of $400
000. The costs incurred to meet these conditions are being charged to intangible assets. As of November 30
 2019
 the Company has recorded $400
000 of costs to the asset account. Of this amount $200
000 will be paid over time as the Company purchases omega-3 oil from DSM pursuant to its exclusive supply agreement. During the 12 months ended November 30

 the FASB issued ASU 2016-12
 Revenue from Contracts from Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. The amendments in this update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09. The core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in ASU 2016-12 do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606

 Earnings Per Share (Topic 260)
 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480)
 Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). The amendments in Part I of this Update change the classification analysis of certain equity-linked financial instruments (or embedded features) with down round features. When determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments
 a down round feature no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity&amp;#8217;s own stock. The amendments also clarify existing disclosure requirements for equity-classified instruments. As a result
 a freestanding equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded conversion option) no longer would be accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value as a result of the existence of a down round feature. For freestanding equity classified financial instruments
 the amendments require entities that present earnings per share (EPS) in accordance with Topic 260 to recognize the effect of the down round feature when it is triggered. That effect is treated as a dividend and as a reduction of income available to common shareholders in basic EPS. Convertible instruments with embedded conversion options that have down round features are now subject to the specialized guidance for contingent beneficial conversion features (in Subtopic 470-20
 Debt&amp;#8212;Debt with Conversion and Other Options)
 including related EPS guidance (in Topic 260). The amendments in Part II of this Update recharacterize the indefinite deferral of certain provisions of Topic 480 that now are presented as pending content in the Codification
 to a scope exception. Those amendments do not have an accounting effect. For public business entities

 the amendments in Part I of this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15

 the FASB issued ASC 842 and as ASU 2016-02
 is the new lease accounting standard published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). It replaced the previous US GAAP leasing standard
 ASC 840. The purpose of the new standard is to close a major accounting loophole in ASC 840: off-balance sheet operating leases. Public companies began to implement the standard starting after December 15
 2018. Private companies will follow a year later on December 15
 2020. ASC 842 represents a significant overhaul of the accounting treatment for leases
 with the most significant change being that most leases
 including most operating leases
 are now capitalized on the balance sheet. Under ASC 840
 FASB permitted operating leases to be reported only in the footnotes of corporate financial statements. Under ASC 842
 the only leases that are exempt from the capitalization requirement are short-term leases less than or equal to 12 months in length. This became effective December 1

The Company&#8217;s financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting. The Company has elected a November 30
The Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements as of November 30
 2019 include the accounts of Trident Brands Incorporated and its subsidiaries: Trident Brands Canada Ltd
 Sports Nutrition Products Inc.
 Brain Armor Inc.
The Company follows the guidance in ASC No. 260
 &#8220;Earnings Per Share&#8221;
 which specifies the computation
Basic net earnings (loss) per share amounts are computed by dividing the net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Due to net losses during the years ended November 30
 2019 and 2018
Accounts receivable are recorded at their original invoice amounts. We regularly review collectability and establish an allowance for uncollectible amounts as necessary. As of November 30
 2019 and 2018
 the Company&#8217;s accounts receivable was netted against an allowance of $55
979 and $32
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is principally determined using the first-in
Inventory at November 30
 2019 consist of raw materials and finished goods of $1
088
949 and $993

 respectively. Inventory at November 30
 2018 consist of raw materials and finished goods of $891
080 and $1
163
983
Our cost method investment consists of an investment in a private company in which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over its operating and financial activities. The investment is tested for impairment
 at least annually
The Company recognized an impairment on its cost method investment of $440
542 during the year ended November 30
We review our long-lived assets
 including intangible assets subject to amortization
 for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets (collectively referred to as &#8220;the asset&#8221;) may not be recoverable. Such circumstances include
a current expectation that
 more likely than not
We continually evaluate whether such events and circumstances have occurred. When such events or circumstances exist
Intangible assets have either an identifiable or indefinite useful life. Intangible assets with identifiable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic or legal life
The intrinsic value of a beneficial conversion feature inherent to a convertible note payable
 which is not bifurcated and accounted for separately from the convertible note payable and may not be settled in cash upon conversion
 is treated as a discount to the convertible note payable. This discount is amortized over the period from the date of issuance to the date the note is due using the effective interest method. If the note payable is retired prior to the end of its contractual term
 the unamortized discount is expensed in the period of retirement to interest expense. In general
 the beneficial conversion feature is measured by comparing the effective conversion price
 after considering the relative fair value of detachable instruments included in the financing transaction
 if any
The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the requirements of FASB ASC 820
 &#8220;Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures&#8221;. ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value
 prescribes methods for measuring fair value
Level 1 &#8211; Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives
Level 2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date and includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions
 including quoted forward prices for commodities
 time value
 volatility factors
 and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments
Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument
 can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity swaps
 interest rate swaps
The carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. These financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable and note payable. The fair value of the Company&#8217;s long-term debt is estimated based on current rates that would be available for debt of similar terms which is not significantly different from its stated value. As of November 30
 2019 the Company did not have any financial assets or liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis
 except for a derivative liability
 related to the embedded conversion option on the 2018 convertible note
 with a fair value of $5
825
480 as of November 30
 2019 and $892

The following are the assumptions used for derivative instruments valued using the Black Scholes option pricing model as of November 30
 2019 and November 30
Fair value accounting requires bifurcation of embedded derivative instruments such as conversion features in convertible debt or equity instruments and measurement of their fair value for accounting purposes. In assessing the convertible debt instruments
 management determines if the convertible debt host instrument is conventional convertible debt and further if there is a beneficial conversion feature requiring measurement. If the instrument is not considered conventional convertible debt under ASC 470
Four customers accounted for 29.7%
 21.8%
 15.0% and 12.7% of total revenue
 compared to two customers for 90.5% and 5.2% in the prior year. Four customers accounted for 29.8%
 11.8%
 6.6% and 5.8% of total accounts receivable
The Company records revenue when all of the following criteria are met: 1) the contract with a customer is identified
 2) the performance obligations in the contract are identified
 3) the transaction price is determined
The Company purchased 98% of its products from three vendors for the year ended November 30
 2019 and one vendor provided 97% of the Company&#8217;s products for the year ended November 30
The Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC-718
 &#8220;Compensation-Stock Compensation&#8221;. ASC-718 requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
 including stock options
 based on the grant-date fair value of the award and to recognize it as compensation expense over the period the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award
The Company accounts for non-employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the provision of ASC 505-50
 &#8220;Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees&#8221; (&#8220;ASC 505-50&#8221;)
Income taxes are provided in accordance with ASC No. 740
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when
 in the opinion of management
 it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the statements of operation in the provision for income taxes. As of November 30
 2019 and 2018
A party is considered to be related to the Company if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries
 controls
 is controlled by
Related parties also include principal owners of the Company

In May 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-12
 Revenue from Contracts from Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. The amendments in this update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09. The core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in ASU 2016-12 do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606
 but instead affect only the narrow aspects noted in Topic 606. Topic 606 became effective for the Company on December 1
In May 2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-09
 Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718)
 Scope of Modification Accounting. The amendments in this Update provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for annual periods
 and interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December 15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in any interim period
 for (1) public business entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued and (2) all other entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been made available for issuance. This became effective December 1
In July 2017
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2017-11
 Earnings Per Share (Topic 260)
 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480)
 Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). The amendments in Part I of this Update change the classification analysis of certain equity-linked financial instruments (or embedded features) with down round features. When determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments
 a down round feature no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity&#8217;s own stock. The amendments also clarify existing disclosure requirements for equity-classified instruments. As a result
 a freestanding equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded conversion option) no longer would be accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value as a result of the existence of a down round feature. For freestanding equity classified financial instruments
 the amendments require entities that present earnings per share (EPS) in accordance with Topic 260 to recognize the effect of the down round feature when it is triggered. That effect is treated as a dividend and as a reduction of income available to common shareholders in basic EPS. Convertible instruments with embedded conversion options that have down round features are now subject to the specialized guidance for contingent beneficial conversion features (in Subtopic 470-20
 Debt&#8212;Debt with Conversion and Other Options)
 including related EPS guidance (in Topic 260). The amendments in Part II of this Update recharacterize the indefinite deferral of certain provisions of Topic 480 that now are presented as pending content in the Codification
 to a scope exception. Those amendments do not have an accounting effect. For public business entities
 the amendments in Part I of this Update are effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December 15
 2018. For all other entities
 the amendments in Part I of this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2020. Early adoption is permitted for all entities
 including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period
In December 2018
 the FASB issued ASC 842 and as ASU 2016-02
 is the new lease accounting standard published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). It replaced the previous US GAAP leasing standard
 ASC 840. The purpose of the new standard is to close a major accounting loophole in ASC 840: off-balance sheet operating leases. Public companies began to implement the standard starting after December 15
 2018. Private companies will follow a year later on December 15
 2020. ASC 842 represents a significant overhaul of the accounting treatment for leases
 with the most significant change being that most leases
 including most operating leases
 are now capitalized on the balance sheet. Under ASC 840
 FASB permitted operating leases to be reported only in the footnotes of corporate financial statements. Under ASC 842
 the only leases that are exempt from the capitalization requirement are short-term leases less than or equal to 12 months in length. This became effective December 1
 2018 and the Company chose early adoption. The adoption did not have any material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements as the Company has no long term leases.

 2016 and previously amended on November 30
 2018 and March 11

On September 12
 2017 we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement dated September 6
 2017 among our wholly owned subsidiary
 Trident Brands International Ltd. (&#8220;Trident International&#8221;)
 a Bahamas corporation
 StreamPak Ltd. (&#8220;StreamPak&#8221;)
 an Anguilla corporation
 and the sole shareholder of StreamPak
 pursuant to which
 in consideration for the payment of $125
000 in cash and 500
000 of our common shares valued at $360
000 based on our stock price on September 6
 2017
 Trident International purchased 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares of StreamPak. As a result of the share purchase StreamPak became a wholly owned subsidiary of Trident International. The acquisition was not deemed an acquisition of a business but rather an acquisition of a finite-lived intangible asset. The total consideration of $485
000 was recognized as an intangible asset related to intellectual property with an estimated useful life of 10 years. As of July 31

 our wholly owned subsidiary
 Trident International
 entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Packaging Lab SAS (&#8220;Packaging Lab&#8221;)
 whereby Trident International sold all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of StreamPak
 a wholly owned subsidiary of Trident International
 to Packaging Lab in consideration of 1
000 common shares representing 10% of fully diluted shares in Packaging Innovation Lab. The investment in Packaging Lab was recorded using the cost method of accounting. The Company elected to measure the nonmonetary transaction based on the recorded amount of StreamPak using the guidance of ASC No. 845 &#8220;Non Monetary Transactions&#8221; since it was determined that the transaction lacked commercial substance. The investment balance of $440
542 was fully impaired as of November 30
 2018.

On January 29
 2015
 the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with a non-US institutional investor whereby it agreed to sell an aggregate principal amount of $2
300
000 of senior secured convertible debentures
The Company received $1
800
000 of the funds from the transaction on February 5
 2015. The balance of $500
000 was received on May 14
 2015. These convertible notes were subsequently acquired by Fengate on April 28
The convertible debentures are convertible into shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock at an initial conversion price of $0.71 per share
 for an aggregate of up to 3
239
437 shares. The debentures originally accrued interest at 6% per annum. On September 26
 2016 the Company entered into an amendment agreement related to these convertible debentures whereby the applicable interest rate was increased from 6% to 8% and provisions added to allow the investor to transfer
 sell or hypothecate the convertible notes subject to applicable securities laws. The maturity date of the notes was also extended through September 30
 2019. We considered ASC Topic 470-50
 Debt Modifications and Extinguishments
Due to the note being convertible to common shares of the Company
 a beneficial conversion feature analysis was performed. The intrinsic value of the conversion feature was $647
888 which was recognized as debt discount. As of November 30

 the investor has agreed
 from time to time after January 1
 2017
 to make additional investments at the Company&#8217;s request of up to $5

 2018 the third tranche of $1
500
000 for a total investment by the investor of $10
000
In consideration of each advance made by the investor pursuant to the securities purchase agreement
 the Company issued to the investor a convertible promissory note of equal value
 maturing on September 30
 2019
 and bearing interest at the rate of 8% per annum. Each note is secured in first priority against the present and after acquired assets of the Company and is convertible in whole or in part at the option of the holder into common shares of the Company at a conversion price of $0.60 per share
 for an aggregate of up to 16
666
667 shares. These convertible notes were subsequently acquired by Fengate on April 28
Due to the notes being convertible to common shares of the Company
 a beneficial conversion feature analysis was performed. The intrinsic value of the conversion feature of the notes amounted to $3
333
334 and was recognized as a debt discount. Amortization of the debt discount charged to interest amounted to $855
987 and $1
263
619 for the years ended November 30
 2019 and 2018
 respectively. As of November 30
 2019 and 2018 the unamortized discount amounted to $334
988 and $1

On November 30
 2018 the Company and Fengate entered into a Securities Purchase Amendment Agreement pursuant to which the Company has agreed to issue to Fengate an additional convertible promissory note (the &#8220;2018 Convertible Note&#8221;) of up to $10
000
000
 subject to certain terms and conditions. Each portion of the principal amount advanced pursuant to the 2018 Convertible Note will bear interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum and will be payable monthly in arrears to Fengate. Outstanding principal and interest will continue to be secured by the general security agreement dated September 26
 2016
 which forms a part of the Agreement. The holder of the note may also elect from time to time to convert all or a portion of the outstanding principal and interest into common shares of the Company at a 25% discount to the average closing price of the common shares during the 10 trading days immediately prior to the applicable conversion date. The 2018 Convertible Note will mature on May 31
On November 30
 2018 the Company received the first tranche of funding with proceeds of $3
400
780. The 2nd tranche of $2
804
187 was received on April 13
 2019. The 3rd tranche of $3
795
033 less $936
168 withheld for interest payments up to and including June 30
 2020 was received on November 6
 2019. The withheld interest was recorded as debt discount. As of November 30
 2019
 $226
168 was amortized and $710
000 is unamortized. All of the convertible notes were extended and will mature on December 1
The Company intends to use the proceeds of the secured convertible note for general working capital purposes including
 without limitation
 product development
 inventory
The Company analysed the embedded conversion option on the convertible notes for derivative accounting consideration under ASC 815-15 &#8220;Derivatives and Hedging&#8221; and determined that the conversion option on the 2018 Convertible Note qualified for derivative accounting. The Company used the Black-Scholes model to value the embedded conversion option at $892
000 on the issuance date of November 30
 2018
 $1
911
256 on the issuance date of April 13
 2019 and $1
696
933 on the issuance date of November 6
 2019. The assumptions used were a discount rate of 2.80%
 1.96% and 1.96%; volatility rate of 79.57%
 104.70% and 107.3%; and a term of 1.50
 1.13 and 0.57 years respectively. The Company used the Black-Scholes model to re-value the embedded conversion options issued on November 30
 2018 at $5
825
480 as of November 30
 2019. The change of $1
325
291 was recorded as derivative loss expense. The assumptions used were a discount rate of 1.96%
 volatility of 126.24% and a term of 0.50 year. The fair value of the embedded conversion options were recorded as debt discount and will be amortized over the term of the 2018 and 2019 Convertible Notes. The amortization recognized in the current period was $1
857
295. The unamortized discount as of November 30
 2019 was $2

On September 12
 2017 the Company entered into a note purchase agreement with Fengate Trident LP (&#8220;Fengate&#8221;) pursuant to which
 in consideration for the issuance of 811
887 of our common shares to Fengate
 we purchased outstanding secured convertible promissory notes of Mycell Technologies LLC having an aggregate balance due and payable of $511
141 in principal and $94

Nov. 30
 2019







The Company&#8217;s financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting. The Company has elected a November 30
 year-end.









The Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements as of November 30
 2019 include the accounts of Trident Brands Incorporated and its subsidiaries: Trident Brands Canada Ltd
 Sports Nutrition Products Inc.
 Brain Armor Inc.
 Trident Sports Nutrition Inc. and Trident Brands International Ltd.




The Company follows the guidance in ASC No. 260
 &#8220;Earnings Per Share&#8221;
 which specifies the computation
Basic net earnings (loss) per share amounts are computed by dividing the net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Due to net losses during the years ended November 30
 2019 and 2018
 diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as the basic earnings (loss) per share since inclusion of common stock equivalents would have been anti-dilutive.









Accounts receivable are recorded at their original invoice amounts. We regularly review collectability and establish an allowance for uncollectible amounts as necessary. As of November 30
 2019 and 2018
 the Company&#8217;s accounts receivable was netted against an allowance of $55
979 and $32
383 respectively.




Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is principally determined using the first-in
Inventory at November 30
 2019 consist of raw materials and finished goods of $1
088
949 and $993
877
 respectively. Inventory at November 30
 2018 consist of raw materials and finished goods of $891
080 and $1
163
983
 respectively.




Our cost method investment consists of an investment in a private company in which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over its operating and financial activities. The investment is tested for impairment
 at least annually
The Company recognized an impairment on its cost method investment of $440
542 during the year ended November 30
 2018.




We review our long-lived assets
 including intangible assets subject to amortization
 for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets (collectively referred to as &#8220;the asset&#8221;) may not be recoverable. Such circumstances include
a current expectation that
 more likely than not
We continually evaluate whether such events and circumstances have occurred. When such events or circumstances exist
 the recoverability of the asset&#8217;s carrying value shall be determined by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows (cash inflows less associated cash outflows) that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset.




Intangible assets have either an identifiable or indefinite useful life. Intangible assets with identifiable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic or legal life
 whichever is shorter. The Company currently does not have any amortizable intangible assets. The Company&#8217;s indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trademarks.




The intrinsic value of a beneficial conversion feature inherent to a convertible note payable
 which is not bifurcated and accounted for separately from the convertible note payable and may not be settled in cash upon conversion
 is treated as a discount to the convertible note payable. This discount is amortized over the period from the date of issuance to the date the note is due using the effective interest method. If the note payable is retired prior to the end of its contractual term
 the unamortized discount is expensed in the period of retirement to interest expense. In general
 the beneficial conversion feature is measured by comparing the effective conversion price
 after considering the relative fair value of detachable instruments included in the financing transaction
 if any
 to the fair value of the common shares at the commitment date to be received upon conversion.




The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the requirements of FASB ASC 820
 &#8220;Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures&#8221;. ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value
 prescribes methods for measuring fair value
Level 1 &#8211; Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives
Level 2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date and includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions
 including quoted forward prices for commodities
 time value
 volatility factors
 and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments
Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument
 can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity swaps
 interest rate swaps
The carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. These financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable and note payable. The fair value of the Company&#8217;s long-term debt is estimated based on current rates that would be available for debt of similar terms which is not significantly different from its stated value. As of November 30
 2019 the Company did not have any financial assets or liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis
 except for a derivative liability
 related to the embedded conversion option on the 2018 convertible note
 with a fair value of $5
825
480 as of November 30
 2019 and $892
000 as of November 30

The following are the assumptions used for derivative instruments valued using the Black Scholes option pricing model as of November 30
 2019 and November 30
 2018:




Fair value accounting requires bifurcation of embedded derivative instruments such as conversion features in convertible debt or equity instruments and measurement of their fair value for accounting purposes. In assessing the convertible debt instruments
 management determines if the convertible debt host instrument is conventional convertible debt and further if there is a beneficial conversion feature requiring measurement. If the instrument is not considered conventional convertible debt under ASC 470
 the Company will continue its evaluation process of these instruments as derivative financial instruments under ASC 815. The Company applies the guidance in ASC 815-40-35-12 to determine the order in which each convertible instrument would be evaluated for derivative classification. The Company&#8217;s sequencing policy is to evaluate for reclassification contracts with the earliest inception date first.




Four customers accounted for 29.7%
 21.8%
 15.0% and 12.7% of total revenue
 compared to two customers for 90.5% and 5.2% in the prior year. Four customers accounted for 29.8%
 11.8%
 6.6% and 5.8% of total accounts receivable
The Company records revenue when all of the following criteria are met: 1) the contract with a customer is identified
 2) the performance obligations in the contract are identified
 3) the transaction price is determined
 4) the transaction price has been allocated to the performance obligations and 5) when each performance obligation is satisfied.




The Company purchased 98% of its products from three vendors for the year ended November 30
 2019 and one vendor provided 97% of the Company&#8217;s products for the year ended November 30
 2018.




The Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC-718
 &#8220;Compensation-Stock Compensation&#8221;. ASC-718 requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
 including stock options
 based on the grant-date fair value of the award and to recognize it as compensation expense over the period the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award
 usually the vesting period.




The Company accounts for non-employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the provision of ASC 505-50
 &#8220;Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees&#8221; (&#8220;ASC 505-50&#8221;)
 which requires that such equity instruments are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date. The measurement of stock-based compensation is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying equity instruments vest.




Income taxes are provided in accordance with ASC No. 740
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when
 in the opinion of management
 it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the statements of operation in the provision for income taxes. As of November 30
 2019 and 2018
 the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.




A party is considered to be related to the Company if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries
 controls
 is controlled by
Related parties also include principal owners of the Company
 its management
 members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. A party which can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests is also a related party.




In May 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-12
 Revenue from Contracts from Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. The amendments in this update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09. The core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in ASU 2016-12 do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606
 but instead affect only the narrow aspects noted in Topic 606. Topic 606 became effective for the Company on December 1
In May 2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-09
 Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718)
 Scope of Modification Accounting. The amendments in this Update provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for annual periods
 and interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December 15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in any interim period
 for (1) public business entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued and (2) all other entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been made available for issuance. This became effective December 1
In July 2017
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2017-11
 Earnings Per Share (Topic 260)
 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480)
 Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). The amendments in Part I of this Update change the classification analysis of certain equity-linked financial instruments (or embedded features) with down round features. When determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments
 a down round feature no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity&#8217;s own stock. The amendments also clarify existing disclosure requirements for equity-classified instruments. As a result
 a freestanding equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded conversion option) no longer would be accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value as a result of the existence of a down round feature. For freestanding equity classified financial instruments
 the amendments require entities that present earnings per share (EPS) in accordance with Topic 260 to recognize the effect of the down round feature when it is triggered. That effect is treated as a dividend and as a reduction of income available to common shareholders in basic EPS. Convertible instruments with embedded conversion options that have down round features are now subject to the specialized guidance for contingent beneficial conversion features (in Subtopic 470-20
 Debt&#8212;Debt with Conversion and Other Options)
 including related EPS guidance (in Topic 260). The amendments in Part II of this Update recharacterize the indefinite deferral of certain provisions of Topic 480 that now are presented as pending content in the Codification
 to a scope exception. Those amendments do not have an accounting effect. For public business entities
 the amendments in Part I of this Update are effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December 15
 2018. For all other entities
 the amendments in Part I of this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2020. Early adoption is permitted for all entities
 including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period
In December 2018
 the FASB issued ASC 842 and as ASU 2016-02
 is the new lease accounting standard published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). It replaced the previous US GAAP leasing standard
 ASC 840. The purpose of the new standard is to close a major accounting loophole in ASC 840: off-balance sheet operating leases. Public companies began to implement the standard starting after December 15
 2018. Private companies will follow a year later on December 15
 2020. ASC 842 represents a significant overhaul of the accounting treatment for leases
 with the most significant change being that most leases
 including most operating leases
 are now capitalized on the balance sheet. Under ASC 840
 FASB permitted operating leases to be reported only in the footnotes of corporate financial statements. Under ASC 842
 the only leases that are exempt from the capitalization requirement are short-term leases less than or equal to 12 months in length. This became effective December 1
 2018 and the Company chose early adoption. The adoption did not have any material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements as the Company has no long term leases.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business within one year after the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
 or the FASB
 Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15
 Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)
 our management evaluates whether there are conditions or events
 considered in aggregate
As of November 30
 2019
 the Company had $1
013
674 in cash and a working capital deficit of $18
293
740. The Company also has generated losses and has an accumulated deficit as of November 30
 2019. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The Company completed additional long-term financing with the non-US institutional investor
 receiving proceeds of $3

780 on November 30
 2018

033 (less $936
168 withheld for interest payments up to and including June 30
 2020) on November 6
 2019 through the issuance of secured convertible promissory notes. However
 unless management is able to obtain additional financing
 the Company may not be able to meet its funding requirements during the next 12 months. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.



































The entire disclosure when substantial doubt is raised about the ability to continue as a going concern. Includes
 but is not limited to
 principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern
 management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the ability to meet its obligations
 and management's plans that alleviated or are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern.

The estimated measure of the percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.

 and weighted-average grant date fair value.




























Tabular disclosure of warrants or rights issued. Warrants and rights outstanding are derivative securities that give the holder the right to purchase securities (usually equity) from the issuer at a specific price within a certain time frame. Warrants are often included in a new debt issue to entice investors by a higher return potential. The main difference between warrants and call options is that warrants are issued and guaranteed by the company
 whereas options are exchange instruments and are not issued by the company. Also
 the lifetime of a warrant is often measured in years
 while the lifetime of a typical option is measured in months. Disclose the title of issue of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the aggregate amount of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the date from which the warrants or rights are exercisable
 and the price at which the warrant or right is exercisable.

On December 23
 2013
 the Company entered into a Deed of Assignment Agreement with Everlast World&#8217;s Boxing Headquarters Corporation
 International Brand Management Limited
 Sports Nutrition Products Incorporated and Manchester Capital Incorporated wherein Everlast
 International Brand
 Sports Nutrition and Manchester Capital are parties to a trade mark license and Sports Nutrition
 a New York corporation
 has assigned its interest in the trade mark license to the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the assignment agreement
 Sports Nutrition Products Incorporated
 a wholly owned subsidiary of Trident Brands Incorporated
 assigned all of its rights
 title
 interest and benefit to the trade mark license to the Company effective December 23
 2013 and the Company assumed all of the obligations of Sports Nutrition Products Incorporated under the license agreement. The Company shall remain responsible to Everlast and International Brand for all acts and omissions of the subsidiary
The Everlast License Agreement includes a clause stating that Manchester Capital Incorporated will guarantee that the Licensee shall perform all of its obligations and duties under the Licence Agreement. If the Licensee defaults in the payment when due of any amount it is obliged to pay to Licensor under the Licence Agreement
 or arising from its termination
The Royalty Calculation
 as per the terms of the agreement
 are as follows: In 2013
 7% of Net Retail Sales and 7% of 60% of Direct Response Sales Revenue; in 2014
 8% of Net Retail Sales and 8% of 60% of Direct Response Sales Revenue; in 2015
 9% of Net Retail Sales and 9% of 60% of Direct Response Sales Revenue; in 2016 onwards
 10% of Net Retail Sales and 10% of 60% of Direct Response Sales Revenue. The Annual Minimum Guaranteed Royalty is $120

 if the Agreement remains in force

The agreement was terminated on December 31
 2017. On January 17
 2019
 Everlast World&#8217;s Boxing Headquarters Corp. (&#8220;Everlast&#8221;) filed a counter civil lawsuit against the Company and other defendants. In that lawsuit
 Everlast seeks payment from the defendants under a License Agreement dated June 4
 2013
 for $425
555 in unpaid royalties allegedly due and owing under the License Agreement and interest on the allegedly unpaid royalties of $96
265
 which interest allegedly continues to accrue. Everlast has also sought all costs
 expenses
 and legal fees incurred by Everlast in collecting monies that it claims are due under the License Agreement. On February 26
 2020
 the court in the Everlast matter issued an Opinion and Order granting a motion to dismiss all of Trident&#8217;s claims against Everlast and granting a motion for judgment on the pleadings as to liability against Trident. The Court left open the question of damages to be awarded to Everlast. Trident has requested that the parties participate in settlement discussions before a magistrate judge or
 in the alternative
The Company may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. If any legal matter
 that may arise
 were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management&#8217;s expectations
 the Company&#8217;s would reflect any potential claim in the consolidated financial statements for that reporting period.
