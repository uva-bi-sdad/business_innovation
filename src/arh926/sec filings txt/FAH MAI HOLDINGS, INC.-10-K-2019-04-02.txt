ITEM
1. BUSINESS.

Fah
Mai Holdings
 Inc. (&ldquo;Fah Mai&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;)
 formerly known as Finch Street Acquisition Corporation
was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 22
 2016
 under the laws of the State of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate
undertaking
 including
 but not limited to
 selected mergers and acquisitions.


On
February 27
 2017
 the Company implemented a change of control by issuing shares to new shareholders
 redeeming shares of existing
shareholders
 electing new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors.
In connection with the change of control
 the shareholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the
change of the Company&rsquo;s name from Finch Street Acquisition Corporation to Fah Mai Holdings
 Inc.




The
Company is now an early-stage company whose current business is in acquiring
 holding and divesting alternative assets
 specifically
rare whisky and similar commodities that the Company expects to increase in value. The Company also expects to open &ldquo;member
only&rdquo; clubs designed to cater to rare liquor connoisseurs and high net worth individuals
 which shall also function as distribution
and marketing centers for the divestment of its assets.


As
of December 31
 2018
 the Company had not yet generated significant revenue since inception to date and has sustained an operating
loss and negative cash flows from operations since inception. During the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Company sustained net
loss of $570
434
 and at December 31
 2018 had an accumulated deficit of $613
683.


The
Company&rsquo;s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue
as a going concern. At present
 the Company has limited operations and the continuation of the Company as a going concern
is dependent upon financial support from its stockholders
 its ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations
and/or to successfully locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with the Company.



There
is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable.


Louis
Haseman
 the sole officer and director of the Company
 entered into an agreement with Tiber Creek Corporation
 which assists
companies in becoming public companies and assists companies with introductions to the financial community. The former President
of the Company is the sole officer and director of Tiber Creek Corporation.




    
    


On
November 7
 2017
 the Company acquired all outstanding shares of Fah Mai Holdings Limited (&ldquo;Fah Mai UK&rdquo;) and Platinum
Cask Limited (&ldquo;Platinum Cask&rdquo;)
 both UK companies from Louis Haseman. These entities are part of the merger and acquisition
plan to run operations and hold and manage whisky inventories.

On
June 8
 2018
 the Company entered into a merger agreement (the &ldquo;Merger Agreement&rdquo;) with Fah Mai Holdings Co.
 Ltd.
a private company organized under the laws of the Thailand (&ldquo;Fah Mai Thailand&rdquo;). Under the Merger Agreement
 the Company
issued to the shareholders of Fah Mai Thailand 400
000 shares of its common stock
 valued at $0.0001 per share
 in exchange for
all of the issued and outstanding equity securities of Fah Mai Thailand (the &ldquo;Merger&rdquo;). Mr. Louis Haseman
 who is
an officer
 director and shareholder of the Company
 was an officer and equity holder of Fah Mai Thailand prior to the Merger.
As a result of the Merger
 Fah Mai Thailand has merged into the Company and has taken over the operations and business plan of
Fah Mai Thailand. This was a merger of net assets between entities under common control. Accordingly
 the net assets and liabilities
of Fah Mai Thailand were recorded on the books of the Company at their historical values.

5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT&rsquo;S COMMON EQUITY
 RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

There
is currently no public market for the Company&rsquo;s securities.

At
such time as it qualifies
 the Company may choose to apply for quotation of its securities on the OTC Bulletin Board.

The
OTC Bulletin Board is a dealer-driven quotation service. Unlike the Nasdaq Stock Market
 companies cannot directly apply to be
quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board
 only market makers can initiate quotes
 and quoted companies do not have to meet any quantitative
financial requirements. Any equity security of a reporting company not listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market or on a national securities
exchange is eligible.

As
such time as it qualifies
 the Company may choose to apply for quotation of its securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In general
there is greatest liquidity for traded securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market and less on the OTC Bulletin Board. It is not possible
to predict where
 if at all
 the securities of the Company will be traded following a business combination.


Since
inception
 the Company has sold securities which were not registered as described below. All such securities were issued pursuant
to an exemption from registration of the Securities Act of 1933
 as amended
 as a transaction by an issuer not involving any public
offering
 as noted below. Each of these transactions was issued as part of a private placement of securities by the Company in
which (i) no general advertising or solicitation was used
 and (ii) the investors purchasing securities were acquiring the same
for investment purposes only
 without a view to resale. Furthermore
 no underwriters participated or effectuated any of the transactions
specified below. Also
 no underwriting discounts or commissions applied to any of the transactions set forth below. All potential
investors were contacted personally and possessed at the time of their investment bona fide substantive
 pre-existing business
relationships with the Company and/or its officers
 directors and affiliates. No potential investors were contacted through other
means
 and no general advertising or general solicitation was used to solicit any investors.




The
Company (as Finch Street Acquisition Corporation) issued an aggregate of 20
000
000 common shares on formation in July 22
 2016
pro rata (10
000
000 each) to James Cassidy and James McKillop
 at a purchase price equal to $0.0001 per share
 of which all but
an aggregate of 500
000 shares were contributed back to the Company and cancelled.

February 27
 2017

 Inc. issued 40
000
000 shares of its common stock at par of $0.0001 per share pursuant to
Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 at par representing 98.7% of the total outstanding 40
500
000 shares of common stock
as part of a change in control to Louis J. Haseman
 the current CEO of the Company.

 2017 and December 31
 2017
 the Company issued 790
970 shares of common stock to 53 individuals at $0.45 - $0.50 per

Business
Summary



Fah
Mai is an early-stage company whose current business is in acquiring
 holding and divesting alternative assets
 specifically rare
whisky and similar commodities. Fah Mai&rsquo;s acquisition strategy is to purchase alternative assets that Fah Mai expects will
have a high incline in asset worth. Fah Mai also expects to open &ldquo;member only&rdquo; clubs designed to cater to rare liquor
connoisseurs and high net worth individuals
 which shall also function as distribution and marketing centers for the divestment
of its assets.

Fah
Mai&rsquo;s initial acquisition strategy is to acquire rare whisky. Further
 Fah Mai will initially acquire whisky as its initial
asset class targeted for acquisition since whisky has a diverse unit purchase price that would allow Fah Mai to purchase units
whose costs range from $100 per unit up to units in excess of $500
000 per unit. Fah Mai expects that once it has built a solid
base of rare whisky assets
 it will broaden its acquisition strategy to target other appreciating alternative asset classes
 such
as stamps
 cognacs
 comics
 memorabilia
 watches and cars. Fah Mai believes that these alternative asset classes present an attractive
opportunity to investors because of the anticipated high returns on investment and their idiosyncratic appeal.


    
    



In
addition
 in order to maximize profits from our whisky
 Fah Mai plans on opening five exclusive &ldquo;member only&rdquo; clubs
to be located in Tokyo
 Bangkok
 London
 New York and Shanghai. These clubs shall be designed to be high-class drinking establishments
that will also function as marketing venues and retail outlets for the divestment of its assets.

Fah
Mai has developed a new concept to sell its whiskey we call &ldquo;cask fractions.&rdquo; A cask fraction is a percentage of the
contents of a cask. Due to the fact that as a cask ages
 and its volume of spirit decreases (the angels share)
 the simplest way
to break it down is into fractions. Each cask is broken down into a different number of fractions depending on its value to get
a conformed GBP 20.00 (approximately US$27) starting value for each fraction. Fah Mai&rsquo;s cask fraction system is a method
of enabling purchasers to acquire rare whiskey at a discounted price
 since purchasing casks of rare whiskey at a wholesale price
is typically less than purchasing individual bottles of the same quantity of rare whiskey at a retail price. Under Fah Mai&rsquo;s
cask fraction system
 individuals who participate in the Company&rsquo;s membership program are eligible to purchase different
varieties of rare whiskey from Fah Mai
 in the form of a cask fraction
 depending on their membership tier. After purchase of
a particular cask fraction
 the purchaser may elect to have the purchased whiskey bottled and sent to their address for consumption
or otherwise may elect to have Fah Mai hold such purchased whiskey on consignment for the benefit of the purchaser in the event
of resale. We do not permit United States persons or entities to participate in the Company&rsquo;s membership program or purchase
cask fractions.

Furthermore
Fah Mai will start an online whisky auction business to generate solid revenue. The whisky online auction market is small at the
moment
 which means it will be easy to capitalize on this particular market. Fah Mai&rsquo;s whisky auction site will undercut
all existing sites commissions and listing fees in order to achieve this. Fah Mai&rsquo;s whisky auction site will be able to
do this and still make money as the commissions saved by not paying to other auction sites when acquiring whisky assets will make
up for the lower commission charges and listing fees to customers.

We
see the opportunity for revenue generation through the creation of both our independent bottling company and our online whisky
auction
 which we believe will primarily benefit the rare whisky collection.

Our
bottling label Platinum Cask Ltd
 has been created to act as the primary channel though which we will sell the assets held in
the rare whisky collection at such a time as we see fit. The creation of the Platinum Cask brand at such an early stage in the
collections lifespan is purely to build brand awareness and confidence
 thereby
 increasing the potential profitability of the
rare whisky assets in years to come.

In
order to build awareness of the Platinum Cask brand
 we intend to bottle and sell our own whisky which will be sourced and selected
from our own cask collection that forms a small part of the greater rare whisky collection. This process of collecting
 trading
and bottling of our own casks should generate additional income for Fah Mai via Platinum Cask
 a subsidiary of the company.

The
creation of our own online whisky auction portal will also directly benefit our rare whisky collection
 whilst also offering an
opportunity to generate additional income. By creating our own whisky auctions
 our collection will directly benefit by avoiding
the cost of auctioneers&rsquo; fees that we currently pay to third-party auction companies. The money we spend on fees that currently
run between 10 to 15% before tax
 can be partly re-channeled into the promotion and operation of the auction company itself. This
would grow the number of customers using the service
 increasing the number of bottles that we would have access to at a zero-fee
rate and also providing extra income through fees we would be able to charge our customers for using our service.

We
do not anticipate needing to spend as much on the operation of our own whisky auction as we currently do on fees when acquiring
bottles from third parties. This would enable us to direct more money to the collection itself.


    
    



Summary
of Operations

The
Company currently operates from its offices located at 1000/196
199 Liberty Buildings
 3rd Floor
 Sukhumvit 55 Road
 Klongton
Nua
 Wattana
 Bangkok 10110; provided
 the Company plans to conduct its rare whiskey resale business primarily through its websites
on the internet.

The
Company&rsquo;s online whiskey auction business is currently under development and is expected to be operational in 2019. The
Company plans to open five exclusive &ldquo;member only&rdquo; clubs to be located in Tokyo
 Bangkok
 London
 New York and Shanghai
and is expected to begin development on them in 2021. The Company plans to build its own whisky brand
 Platinum Cask
 which is
currently under development and is expected to be operational in 2021 as well.

Risks
and Uncertainties facing the Company

As
an early-stage company
 the Company has limited operating history and is expected to continuously experience losses in the near
term. The Company needs to increase its revenue or locate additional financing in order to continue its developmental plans. As
a company in the early part of its life
 management of the Company must develop and market its technologies in order to execute
the business plan of the Company on a broad scale. The Company anticipates that it would need approximately $281
000 over the
next 12 months to continue as a going concern and expand its operations in accordance with its current business plan.

One
of the biggest challenges facing the Company will be in securing adequate capital to maintain our operations and implement effective
sales
 marketing and distribution strategies to reach our intended end customers. The Company has considered and devised its initial
sales
 marketing and advertising strategy
 however
 the Company will need to skillfully implement this strategy in order to achieve
success in its business.

Due
to financial constraints and the early stage of the Company&rsquo;s life
 the Company has to date conducted limited advertising
and marketing to reach customers. In addition
 the Company has not yet located the sources of funding to develop the Company on
a broader scale through acquisitions or other major partnerships. If the Company were unable to locate such financing and/or later
develop strong and reliable sources of potential customers and a means to efficiently reach buyers and customers
 it is unlikely
that the Company could develop its operations to return revenue sufficient to further develop its business plan. Moreover
 the
above assumes that the Company&rsquo;s services are consistently met with client satisfaction in the marketplace and exhibit steady
success amongst the potential customer base
 neither of which is reasonably predictable or guaranteed.





    
    


The
Company&rsquo;s independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt as to the ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern. Unless the Company is able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and/or obtain additional financing
 there
is a substantial doubt as to the ability of the company to continue as a going concern.

Revenues
and Losses

During
the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Company posted revenues of $23
252
 total operating expenses of $587
665
 consisting of
general and administrative expenses of $587
665
 and a net loss of $570
434.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

As
of December 31
 2018
 the Company had cash available of $18
575.

There
is no assurance that the Company&rsquo;s activities will generate sufficient revenues to sustain its operations without additional
capital
 or if additional capital is needed
 that such funds
 if available
 will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company.
Accordingly
 given the Company&rsquo;s limited cash and cash equivalents on hand
 the Company will be unable to implement its
business plans and proposed operations unless it obtains additional financing or otherwise is able to generate revenues and profits.
The Company may raise additional capital through sales of debt or equity
 obtain loan financing or develop and consummate other
alternative financial plans.

Discussion
of Year ended December 31
 2018 compared to Year Ended December 31
 2017


During
the year ended December 31
 and December 31
 2017
 the
Company generated $23
252 and $0 in revenue. The Company is still in the early stages of its operations and is
working on implementing its plans for commercialization.


During
the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Company posted a net loss of $570
434 as compared to a net loss of $35
687 for the year
ended December 31
 2017. The increase in net loss resulted from the shift in the focus of the operations of the Company as a result
of a change in control of the Company.

Operating
expenses were $587
665 for the year ended December 31
 2018 as compared to $36
215 for the year ended December 31
 2017. The increase
in operating expenses resulted primarily from the shift in the focus of the operations of the Company as a result of a change
in control of the Company.

During
the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Company used cash in operating activities of $645
995. During such period
 the Company also
used cash in investing activities in the amount of $222
569 through acquiring subsidiaries and an advance to a related entity
in anticipation of a merger
 and received $807
729 in financing activities through the issuance of common stock. In contrast
during the year ended December 31
 2017
 the Company used cash in operating activities of $45
738. During such period
 the Company
also used cash in investing activities in the amount of $266
430 by advancing funds to a related party
 and received $394
066
in financing activities through the issuance of common stock. The increase in cash resulted primarily from the issuance of common
stock for cash due to the shift in the focus of the operations of the Company as a result of a change in control of the Company.

As
of December 31
 2018
 the Company had $18
575 in cash. In contrast
 as of December 31
 2017
 the Company had $81
118 in cash.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

The
Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.


    
    


Equipment
Financing

The
Company has no existing equipment financing arrangements.

Alternative
Financial Planning

The
Company has no alternative financial plans at the moment. If the Company is not able to successfully raise monies as needed through
a private placement or other securities offering (including
 but not limited to
 a primary public offering of securities)
 the
Company&rsquo;s ability to survive as a going concern and implement any part of its business plan or strategy will be severely
jeopardized.

The
Company does not anticipate that it will generate revenue sufficient to cover its planned operating expenses
 and the Company
must obtain additional financing in order to develop and implement its business plan and proposed operations. If the Company is
not successful in generating sufficient revenues and/or obtaining additional funding to develop its business plan and proposed
operations
 this could have a material adverse effect on its business
 results of operations liquidity and financial condition.

Critical
Accounting Policies

For
the period ending December 31
 2018
 the consolidated financial statements have been prepared and audited in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States. The following significant accounting policies
 which are described
in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements
 involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly
 these
are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results
of operations.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.
There were $18
575 and $81
118 cash equivalents as of December 31
 2018 and December 31
 2017
 respectively.

Concentration
of Credit Risk

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places
its cash with high quality banking institutions. The Company did not have cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation limit as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

In
accordance with ASC 820
 the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable approximates fair value due to the
short-term maturity of these instruments. ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value
 prescribes methods for measuring fair
value
 and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

Level
1- Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.


    
    


Level
2- Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets
 quoted prices for identical or similar
assets and liabilities in markets that are not active
 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable
 and inputs derived
from or corroborated by observable market data.

Level
3- Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity&rsquo;s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.

The
carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash
 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair market
value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments.

Income
Taxes

Under
ASC 740
 &ldquo;Income Taxes
&rdquo; deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when
it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31
 2018 and
December 31
 2017
 there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward
prior to expiration.

Net
Loss per Share

The
computation of earnings per share of common stock is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding at the date of
the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31
 2018 and December 31
 2017
 there are no potentially dilutive
common stock equivalents.

Revenue
Recognition

Effective
January 1
 2018 we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;)
Subtopic 606-10
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (&ldquo;ASC 606-10&rdquo;). The adoption of ASC 606-10 had no impact on
prior year or previously disclosed amounts. In accordance with ASC 606-10
 revenue is measured based on a consideration specified
in a contract with a customer and recognized when we satisfy the performance obligation specified in each contract.


The
Company&rsquo;s revenue consists primarily of whisky sales and membership sales. Membership fees are charged to become
a member with the ability to buy and sell rare or special whisky casks as a group and to use this group to help make the investing
in these whiskies more affordable. Whisky sales are from the sale of the Company&rsquo;s rare or special whisky inventory that
has been acquired by the Company.

The
Company&rsquo;s revenue is generated by selling membership fees and per-item sales of whisky. The membership fees are for a specified
term. Membership fee revenue is recognized through the term of the memberships. Whisky sale revenues are recognized when the whisky
inventory items are sold. These are per-item sales and all revenue is recognized upon the completion of the performance obligation
to provide the sold item to the buyer. Revenues are presented net of refunds
 credits and known and estimated credit card chargebacks.
The Company reports revenue net of any required taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities
 with the
collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.

During
the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Company began selling cask fractions to members. Cask fractions are fractions of casks held
in inventory that are sold to members at GBP20.00 per fraction. When the Company sales these specific casks
 the sale amounts
associated with these fractions of the cask that have been sold are passed on to the members as returns on their investments.
The Company retains a set percentage of the sale amounts as their fee for facilitating the sale. The Cask fractions sold by the
Company are recorded as deferred until the casks are sold. As of December 31
 2018
 the Company had $75
158 in deferred revenues.
The Company will hold these cask fractions sales as deferred revenues based on the casks purchased and record revenue in line
with the sale of the specific casks that have been purchased by members.

In
February 2018
 the Company made the decision to change auditors and engaged Pinnacle Accountancy Group of Utah for its
December 31
 2017 audit. There were no disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure for the period covered
by this report.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our
management
 with the participation of our prior principal executive and financial officer
 evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended
 the Exchange
Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation
 our Chief Executive Officer and principal financial
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report (based on the
evaluation of these controls and procedures required by Rule 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act) were not effective in ensuring that
information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded
 processed
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission&rsquo;s rules and forms
 and (ii) is accumulated and
communicated to the Company&rsquo;s management
 including its principal executive and principal financial officers
 or persons
performing similar functions
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period
covered by the Report
 we did not have a formal audit committee and there was a lack of segregation of duties.

We
believe that a control system
 no matter how well designed and operated
 cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met
 and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud
 if any
 within a company have been detected.

Management&rsquo;s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of our company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of the Company&rsquo;s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management
assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2018
 the end of our fiscal year. Management based its

of the Treadway Commission (the COSO 2013 Criteria)
the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls
 process documentation
 accounting policies
 and our
overall control environment.


    
    


Based
on our assessment
 management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective
 as of the end
of the fiscal year
 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The management has identified
the following material weaknesses and believes that
 as of December 31
 2018
 our internal control over financial reporting was
not effective: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; (ii) lack of personnel adequately trained in
generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (or U.S. GAAP); and (iii) insufficient written policies and procedures
for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both U.S. GAAP and SEC guidelines.
Management anticipates that such disclosure controls and procedures will not be effective until the above material weaknesses
are remediated. We expect to implement the following measures to remediate the material weaknesses identified
 subject to obtaining
additional financing: (i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk
management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting.

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company&rsquo;s registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management&rsquo;s report was not subject to attestation by the Company&rsquo;s registered public
accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management&rsquo;s
report in this annual report.

Inherent
limitations on effectiveness of controls

Internal
control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals
for advice and guidance
 interpretation of existing and/or changing rules and principles
 segregation of management duties
 scale
of organization
 and personnel factors. Internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence
and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial
reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of its inherent limitations
 internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis
 however these inherent limitations
are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce
 though
not eliminate
 this risk. Therefore
 even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There
were no changes in the Company&rsquo;s internal controls over financial reporting during the period ending December 31
 2018 that
materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 its internal control over financial reporting. Subsequent
to the period covered by this Report and the fourth fiscal quarter
 the Company effected a change in control. New management consists
of two directors and officers who are also shareholders. Such persons maintain complete financial reporting control as the primary
officers. Such control by the primary officers is the same as was in effect prior to the change in control.

ITEM
10. DIRECTORS
 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.


The
Directors and Officers of the Company as of December 31
 2018
 were as follows:






    
    
Positions
    and Offices Held

Louis
    Haseman
    
President
    Secretary
 Chief Financial Officer &amp; Director



Management
of the Company

There
are no agreements or understandings for the officer or director to resign at the request of another person and the above-named
officer and director is not acting on behalf of nor will act at the direction of any other person.

Set
forth below are the names of the directors and officers of the Company
 all positions and offices with the Company held
 the period
during which they have served as such
 and the business experience during at least the last five years:

Louis
Joseph Haseman
 age 34
 serves as President
 Secretary
 Chief Financial Officer and sole director of the Company. From
2010 to the present
 Mr. Haseman has been the director and owner of HGT Co.
 Ltd. with two operating brands: Exotic Golf Holidays
which specializes in golf holidays located around the Indian Ocean and Quality Health Travel which specializes in medical tourism
including plastic surgery
 hip replacements and stem cell treatment. From 2011 to the present
 Mr. Haseman has served as the owner
of Sunscreen Island Co.
 Ltd. which is the exclusive importer and distributor of the Island Tribe sunscreen brand in Thailand
and the Philippines. Since 2012 to the present
 Mr. Haseman has also been part owner of Epikurean Resorts
 a luxury hotel and
resorts management and development company. From 2015-2016
 Mr. Haseman was the owner of Euro Facade Tech Thailand Co.
 Ltd.
a global containment wall and design company.

Conflicts
of Interest

There
are no binding guidelines or procedures for resolving potential conflicts of interest. Failure by management to resolve conflicts
of interest in favor of the Company could result in liability of management to the Company. However
 any attempt by shareholders
to enforce a liability of management to the Company would most likely be prohibitively expensive and time consuming.

Code
of Ethics

The
Company has not at this time adopted a Code of Ethics pursuant to rules described in Regulation S-K. The Company has no operations
or business and does not receive any revenues. The adoption of an Ethical Code at this time would not serve the primary purpose
of such a code to provide a manner of conduct as the development
 execution and enforcement of such a code would be by the same
persons and only persons to whom such code applied. Furthermore
 because the Company does not have any activities
 there are activities
or transactions which would be subject to this code. If the Company enters into a business combination management will propose
adoption of a Code of Ethics.

Corporate
Governance

For
reasons similar to those described above
 the Company does not have a nominating nor audit committee of the board of directors.
At this time
 the Company has only one officer and director. The Company receives no revenues. At such time that the Company enters
into a business combination and/or has additional shareholders and a larger board of directors and commences activities
 the Company
will propose creating committees of its board of directors
 including both a nominating and an audit committee. Management of
the Company intends to review and implement
 as necessary
 procedures for shareholder nomination of members to the Company&rsquo;s
board of directors.

ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

The
Company&rsquo;s officers and directors do not receive any compensation for services rendered to the Company
 nor have they received
such compensation in the past. The officers and directors are not accruing any compensation pursuant to any agreement with the
Company.

No
retirement
 pension
 profit sharing
 stock option or insurance programs or other similar programs have been adopted by the Company
for the benefit of its employees.

The
Company does not have a compensation committee for the same reasons as described above.


    
    


ITEM
12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.

The
following table sets forth
 as of December 31
 2018 each person known by the Company to be the beneficial owner of five percent
or more of the Company&rsquo;s common stock and the director and officer of the Company. The Company does not have any compensation
plans and has not authorized any securities for future issuance. Except as noted
 the holder thereof has sole voting and investment
power with respect to the shares shown.

ITEM
13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
 DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.

James
Cassidy and James McKillop were both formerly officers and directors of the Company and each own 250
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s
common stock
 which were issued at formation
 at a cost basis of $.0001 per share
 in exchange for services rendered. Mr. Cassidy
a partner in the law firm which acts as counsel to the Company
 provides legal services to the Company without charge.

In
February 2017
 the Company issued to Louis Haseman
 the Company&rsquo;s sole officer and director
 40
000
000 shares of its common
stock
 at a purchase price equal to $0.0001 per share
 as part of a change in control.

As
of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 the Company had issued funds to a related party entity in the amount of $0 and $266
430
 respectively
in anticipation of acquiring or merging the entity with the Company. All of these proceeds were loaned to a related party
 Fah
Mai Holdings Co.
 Ltd. (&ldquo;Fah Mai Thailand&rdquo;)
 a Thailand company formed in April 10
 2017 and controlled by the majority
shareholders of the Company. The Company had previously recorded a receivable from a related entity on its books for these funds.
On June 8
 2018
 Fah Mai Thailand was acquired as a subsidiary and is now included in the consolidated financial statements of
the Company. Accordingly
 the inter-company receivable/payable was eliminated on consolidation.

The
Company is not currently required to maintain an independent director as defined by Rule 4200 of the Nasdaq Capital Market nor
does it anticipate that it will be applying for listing of its securities on an exchange in which an independent directorship
is required. It is unlikely that the current director would be considered an independent director if it were to do so.

ITEM
14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES.

The
Company has limited activities and no income. The Company&rsquo;s president has donated his time in preparation and filing of
all state and federal required taxes and reports.

Audit
Fees

The
aggregate fees incurred in 2018 and 2017 for professional services rendered by the independent registered public accounting firm
for the audits of the Company&rsquo;s annual financial statements and review of financial statements included in the Company&rsquo;s
Form 10-K and Form 10-Q reports and services normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements
were as follows:

The
Company does not currently have an audit committee serving and as a result its board of directors performs the duties of an audit
committee. The board of directors will evaluate and approve in advance
 the scope and cost of the engagement of an auditor before
the auditor renders audit and non-audit services. The Company does not rely on pre-approval policies and procedures.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fah Mai Holdings
 Inc.
 (the Company) as of December 31
 2018 and
2017
 and the related statements of operations
 changes in stockholders&rsquo; equity (deficit)
 and cash flows for the years
ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion
the financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of December 31
 2018
and 2017
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the periods then ended
 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to
the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether
due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. As part of our audits
 we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly
 we express no such opinion.

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements
 whether
due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Emphasis
of Matter

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
The Company has suffered recurring losses and has not generated net income from revenues
 which raise substantial doubt about
its ability to continue as a going concern. Management&rsquo;s plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 2. The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 2018 and 2017

NOTE
1 &ndash; DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Nature
of Operations

Fah
Mai Holdings
 Inc. (formerly Finch Street Acquisition Corporation) (&ldquo;Fah Mai&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) was incorporated
on July 22
 2016 under the laws of the state of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking
 including
 but not limited
to
 selected mergers and acquisitions. The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception. The Company has been formed
to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class of securities registered
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On November 7
 2017
 the Company acquired all outstanding shares of Fah Mai Holdings
Limited and Platinum Cask Limited from Louis Haseman at his cost and they became wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. On
June 8
 2018
 the Company entered into a merger agreement (the &ldquo;Merger Agreement&rdquo;) with Fah Mai Holdings Co.
 Ltd.
a private company organized under the laws of the Thailand (&ldquo;Fah Mai Thailand&rdquo;). Under the Merger Agreement
 the Company
issued to the shareholders of Fah Mai Thailand 400
000 shares of its common stock
 valued at $0.0001 per share
 in exchange for
all of the issued and outstanding equity securities of Fah Mai Thailand (the &ldquo;Merger&rdquo;). Mr. Louis Haseman
 who is
an officer
 director and shareholder of the Company
 was an officer and equity holder of Fah Mai Thailand prior to the Merger.
As a result of the Merger
 Fah Mai Thailand has merged into the Company and has taken over the operations and business plan of
Fah Mai Thailand. This was a merger of net assets between entities under common control. Accordingly
 the net assets and liabilities
of Fah Mai Thailand were recorded on the books of the Company at their historical values.

Basis
of Presentation

The
summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the Company&rsquo;s consolidated
financial statements. Such financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the Company&rsquo;s management
who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;) in all material respects
 and have been consistently applied in
 as its fiscal
year end.

Principles
of Consolidation

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Fah Mai Holdings
 Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries
Fah Mai Holdings Co. Ltd.
 Fah Mai Holdings Limited and Platinum Cask Limited (collectively
 the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;). All intercompany
accounts have been eliminated upon consolidation.

Basis
of Valuing Whisky Inventory

The
Company purchases rare Scotch whisky for collection and possible marketing and re-sale. The inventory is recorded at the lower
of cost (purchase price including fees) or market.

NOTE
2 &ndash; GOING CONCERN

The
Company has not yet generated significant revenue since inception to date and has sustained an operating loss of $570
434 for
the year ended December 31
 2018 compared to an operating loss of $35
687 for the year ended December 31
 2017. The Company had
a working capital surplus of $330
938 and an accumulated deficit of $613
683 as of December 31
 2018 compared to a working capital
surplus of $91
319 and an accumulated deficit of $43
249 as of December 31
 2017. The Company&rsquo;s continuation as a going
concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and from stockholders to meet its obligations
and/or obtaining additional financing from its members or other sources
 as may be required.


    
    


The
Company&rsquo;s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue
as a going concern. At present
 the Company has no operations and the continuation of Fah Mai Holdings Inc. as a going concern
is dependent upon financial support from its stockholders and its ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations.

NOTE
3 &ndash; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.
The company had $18
575 and $81
118 in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.

Concentration
of Credit Risk

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places
its cash with high quality banking institutions. The Company did not have cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation limit as of December 31
 2018 and 2017.

Foreign
Currency Translation

The
Company has functional currencies in the United States dollar and British Pounds Sterling and its reporting currency is the United
States dollar. Management has adopted ASC 830-20
 All assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
For revenues and expenses
 the weighted average exchange rate for the period is used. Gains and losses arising on translation
of foreign currency denominated transactions are included in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). Foreign currency transactions
gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in the period of settlement.

Other
Comprehensive Loss

components in the consolidated financial statements. At December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively
 the Company had $4
773 and $780
of accumulated other comprehensive loss
 relating to foreign currency translation.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

In
accordance with ASC 820
 the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable approximates fair value due to the
short-term maturity of these instruments. ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value
 prescribes methods for measuring fair
value
 and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

Level
1- Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.

Level
2- Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets
 quoted prices for identical or similar
assets and liabilities in markets that are not active
 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable
 and inputs derived
from or corroborated by observable market data.


    
    


Level
3- Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity&rsquo;s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.

The
carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash
 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair market
value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments.

Income
Taxes

Under
ASC 740
 &ldquo;Income Taxes
&rdquo; deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when
it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has evaluated Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 118 regarding the impact of the decreased tax rates of the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act
 and have presented the Federal
tax provision
 deferred tax asset
 and valuation allowance using the new rates adjusted in the period of enactment. At December
31
 2018 and 2017 the Company had net operating loss carryforwards (NOL&rsquo;s) of approximately $613
683 and $43
249
 respectively
which may be applied against future taxable income and which expire beginning in 2037. However
 if certain substantial changes
in the Company&rsquo;s ownership should occur
 there could be an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards
that can be utilized. The amount of and ultimate realization of the benefits from the operating loss carryforwards for income
tax purposes is dependent
 in part
 upon the tax laws in effect
 the future earnings of the Company
 and other future events
the effects of which cannot be determined. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the loss carryforwards
 the
Company has established a valuation allowance equal to the tax effect (26% - 21% federal and 5% state) of the loss carryforwards
of approximately $160
000 and $9
300 at December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively
 and therefore
 no deferred tax asset has been
recognized for the loss carryforwards. The change in valuation allowance is approximately $139
000 and $6
600 for the periods
ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively. The tax effect of remaining NOL&rsquo;s and resulting deferred tax assets remain
fully reserved by valuation allowance
 due to continued uncertainty as to their utilization. As of December 31
 2018 and
December 31
 2017
 there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward
prior to expiration.

Net
Loss per Share

The
computation of earnings per share of common stock is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding at the date of
the consolidated financial statements. The net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted
average number of shares of common outstanding. As of December 31
 2018 and December 31
 2017
 there are no potentially
dilutive common stock equivalents.

Revenue
Recognition

Effective
January 1
 2018 we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;)
Subtopic 606-10
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (&ldquo;ASC 606-10&rdquo;). The adoption of ASC 606-10 had no impact on
prior year or previously disclosed amounts. In accordance with ASC 606-10
 revenue is measured based on a consideration specified
in a contract with a customer and recognized when we satisfy the performance obligation specified in each contract.

The
Company&rsquo;s revenue consists of membership sales and whisky sales. Membership fees are charged to become a member with the
ability to buy and sell rare or special whisky casks as a group and to use this group to help make the investing in these whiskies
more affordable. Whisky sales are from the sale of the Company&rsquo;s rare or special whisky inventory that has been acquired
by the Company.

The
Company&rsquo;s revenue is generated by selling membership fees and per-item sales of whisky. The membership fees are for a specified
term. Membership fee revenue is recognized through the term of the memberships. Whisky sale revenues are recognized when the whisky
inventory items are sold. These are per-item sales and all revenue is recognized upon the completion of the performance obligation
to provide the sold item to the buyer. Revenues are presented net of refunds
 credits and known and estimated credit card chargebacks.
The Company reports revenue net of any required taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities
 with the
collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.


    
    


During
the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Company began selling cask fractions to members. Cask fractions are fractions of casks held
in inventory that are sold to members at GBP20.00 per fraction. When the Company sales these specific casks
 the sale amounts
associated with these fractions of the cask that have been sold are passed on to the members as returns on their investments.
The Company retains a set percentage of the sale amounts as their fee for facilitating the sale. The Cask fractions sold by the
Company are recorded as deferred until the casks are sold. As of December 31
 2018
 the Company had $75
158 in deferred revenues.
The Company will hold these cask fractions sales as deferred revenues based on the casks purchased and record revenue in line
with the sale of the specific casks that have been purchased by members.

NOTE
4 &ndash; ADVANCE TO RELATED ENTITY

As

 2018 and 2017

 Ltd. (&ldquo;Fah Mai Thailand&rdquo;)
 a Thailand company formed in April 10
 2017 and Rare Whisky
Auction Co.
 Ltd. (&ldquo;RWA&rdquo;). Both companies are controlled by the majority shareholders of the Company. The Company
has recorded a receivable from a related entity on its books for these funds. On June 8
 2018
 Fah Mai Thailand was acquired as
a subsidiary and is now included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Accordingly
 the inter-company receivable/payable
for this entity was eliminated on consolidation.

the Company is acquiring to collect
 market
 and sell. During the year ended December 31

Fractions. Cask Fractions are fractions of casks that are in the whisky inventory and are sold to outside parties that would like
to invest in rare or special whisky in smaller amounts of money than is required to purchase a complete cask. Upon the sale of
these casks
 the income associated with these cask fractions that have been purchased is passed on to the investors. The amounts

434 for the year ended December 31
 2018 compared to&#13;an operating loss of $35
687 for the year ended December 31
 2017. The Company had a working capital surplus of $330
938 and an&#13;accumulated deficit of $613
683 as of December 31
 2018 compared to a working capital surplus of $91
319 and an accumulated deficit&#13;of $43
249 as of December 31
 2017. The Company&amp;#8217;s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate&#13;sufficient cash flows from operations and from stockholders to meet its obligations and/or obtaining additional financing from&#13;its members or other sources

 the Company had $4

 &amp;#8220;Income Taxes
&amp;#8221;&#13;deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between&#13;the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets&#13;and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary&#13;differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that&#13;some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has evaluated Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 regarding&#13;the impact of the decreased tax rates of the Tax Cuts &amp;#38; Jobs Act
 and have presented the Federal tax provision
 deferred tax&#13;asset
 and valuation allowance using the new rates adjusted in the period of enactment. At December 31
 2018 and 2017 the Company&#13;had net operating loss carryforwards (NOL&amp;#8217;s) of approximately $613
683 and $43
249
 respectively
 which may be applied against&#13;future taxable income and which expire beginning in 2037. However
 if certain substantial changes in the Company&amp;#8217;s ownership&#13;should occur
 there could be an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized. The amount&#13;of and ultimate realization of the benefits from the operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes is dependent
 in part
&#13;upon the tax laws in effect
 the future earnings of the Company
 and other future events
 the effects of which cannot be determined.&#13;Because of the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the loss carryforwards
 the Company has established a valuation allowance&#13;equal to the tax effect (26% - 21% federal and 5% state) of the loss carryforwards of approximately $160
000 and $9
300 at December&#13;31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively
 and therefore
 no deferred tax asset has been recognized for the loss carryforwards. The change&#13;in valuation allowance is approximately $139
000 and $6
600 for the periods ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively. The&#13;tax effect of remaining NOL&amp;#8217;s and resulting deferred tax assets remain fully reserved by valuation allowance
 due to continued&#13;uncertainty as to their utilization. As of&amp;#160;December 31
 2018&amp;#160;and December 31
 2017

 2018&amp;#160;and December 31
 2017

 &amp;#8220;Income Taxes
&amp;#8221;&#13;deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between&#13;the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets&#13;and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary&#13;differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that&#13;some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has evaluated Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 regarding&#13;the impact of the decreased tax rates of the Tax Cuts &amp;#38; Jobs Act
 and have presented the Federal tax provision
 deferred tax&#13;asset
 and valuation allowance using the new rates adjusted in the period of enactment. At December 31
 2018 and 2017 the Company&#13;had net operating loss carryforwards (NOL&amp;#8217;s) of approximately $613
683 and $43
249
 respectively
 which may be applied against&#13;future taxable income and which expire beginning in 2037. However
 if certain substantial changes in the Company&amp;#8217;s ownership&#13;should occur
 there could be an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized. The&#13;amount of and ultimate realization of the benefits from the operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes is dependent
&#13;in part
 upon the tax laws in effect
 the future earnings of the Company
 and other future events
 the effects of which cannot&#13;be determined. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the loss carryforwards
 the Company has established a&#13;valuation allowance equal to the tax effect (26% - 21% federal and 5% state) of the loss carryforwards of approximately $160
000&#13;and $9
300 at December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively
 and therefore
 no deferred tax asset has been recognized for the loss&#13;carryforwards. The change in valuation allowance is approximately $139
000 and $6
600 for the periods ended December 31
 2018&#13;and 2017
 respectively. The tax effect of remaining NOL&amp;#8217;s and resulting deferred tax assets remain fully reserved by valuation&#13;allowance
 due to continued uncertainty as to their utilization. As of&amp;#160;December 31
 2018&amp;#160;and December 31
 2017

 2018&amp;#160;and&#13;2017
 the Company had issued funds to a related party entity in the amount of $6
380 and $266
430
 respectively in anticipation&#13;of acquiring or merging the entity with the Company. All of these proceeds were loaned to two related entities
 Fah Mai Holdings&#13;Co.
 Ltd. (&amp;#8220;Fah Mai Thailand&amp;#8221;)
 a Thailand company formed in April 10
 2017 and Rare Whisky Auction Co.
 Ltd. (&amp;#8220;RWA&amp;#8221;).&#13;Both companies are controlled by the majority shareholders of the Company. The Company has recorded a receivable from a related&#13;entity on its books for these funds. On June 8
 2018
 Fah Mai Thailand was acquired as a subsidiary and is now included in the&#13;consolidated financial statements of the Company. Accordingly


 Inc. (formerly Finch&#13;Street Acquisition Corporation) (&amp;#8220;Fah Mai&amp;#8221; or the &amp;#8220;Company&amp;#8221;) was incorporated on July 22
 2016 under the&#13;laws of the state of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking
 including
 but not limited to
 selected mergers and&#13;acquisitions. The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception. The Company has been formed to provide a method&#13;for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class of securities registered under the Securities&#13;Exchange Act of 1934. On November 7
 2017
 the Company acquired all outstanding shares of Fah Mai Holdings Limited and Platinum&#13;Cask Limited from Louis Haseman at his cost and they became wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. On June 8
 2018
 the Company&#13;entered into a merger agreement (the &amp;#8220;Merger Agreement&amp;#8221;) with Fah Mai Holdings Co.
 Ltd.
 a private company organized&#13;under the laws of the Thailand (&amp;#8220;Fah Mai Thailand&amp;#8221;). Under the Merger Agreement
 the Company issued to the shareholders&#13;of Fah Mai Thailand 400
000 shares of its common stock
 valued at $0.0001 per share
 in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding&#13;equity securities of Fah Mai Thailand (the &amp;#8220;Merger&amp;#8221;). Mr. Louis Haseman
 who is an officer
 director and shareholder&#13;of the Company
 was an officer and equity holder of Fah Mai Thailand prior to the Merger. As a result of the Merger
 Fah Mai Thailand&#13;has merged into the Company and has taken over the operations and business plan of Fah Mai Thailand. This was a merger of net assets&#13;between entities under common control. Accordingly

 2018&amp;#160;and&#13;2017
 the Company had a whisky inventory of $393
788 and $10
201
 respectively. The inventory is recorded at the lower of cost&#13;(purchase price plus fees) or market. The inventory is made up of rare or special whisky that the Company is acquiring to collect
&#13;market
 and sell. During the year ended December 31
 2018
 the Company began selling Cask Fractions. Cask Fractions are fractions&#13;of casks that are in the whisky inventory and are sold to outside parties that would like to invest in rare or special whisky&#13;in smaller amounts of money than is required to purchase a complete cask. Upon the sale of these casks
 the income associated&#13;with these cask fractions that have been purchased is passed on to the investors. The amounts of cask fractions sold totals $75
158&#13;and $0 as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively

 the sale amounts associated with these fractions&#13;of the cask that have been sold are passed on to the members as returns on their investments. The Company retains a set percentage&#13;of the sale amounts as their fee for facilitating the sale. The Cask fractions sold by the Company are recorded as deferred until&#13;the casks are sold.

NOTE 3 &#8211; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES




in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.




instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. The company had $18

$81

 2018 and 2017
 respectively.




subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places its cash with high quality
banking institutions. The Company did not have cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit as of
December 31
 2018 and 2017.




in the United States dollar and British Pounds Sterling and its reporting currency is the United States dollar. Management has
adopted ASC 830-20
All assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. For revenues and expenses
 the
weighted average exchange rate for the period is used. Gains and losses arising on translation of foreign currency denominated
transactions are included in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). Foreign currency&#160;transactions&#160;gains (losses) are recognized
in earnings in the period of settlement.

loss
 relating to foreign currency translation.




 the carrying
value of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.
ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value
 prescribes methods for measuring fair value
 and establishes a fair value hierarchy
to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:


prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.


prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets
 quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets
that are not active
 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable
 and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable
market data.


which reflect the reporting entity&#8217;s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the
asset or liability based on the best available information.


balance sheets for cash
 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair market value based on the short-term maturity
of these instruments.




 &#8220;Income Taxes
&#8221;
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that
some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has evaluated Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 regarding
the impact of the decreased tax rates of the Tax Cuts &#38; Jobs Act
 and have presented the Federal tax provision
 deferred tax
asset
 and valuation allowance using the new rates adjusted in the period of enactment. At December 31
 2018 and 2017 the Company
had net operating loss carryforwards (NOL&#8217;s) of approximately $613
683 and $43
249
 respectively
 which may be applied against
future taxable income and which expire beginning in 2037. However
 if certain substantial changes in the Company&#8217;s ownership
should occur
 there could be an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized. The amount
of and ultimate realization of the benefits from the operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes is dependent
 in part
upon the tax laws in effect
 the future earnings of the Company
 and other future events
 the effects of which cannot be determined.
Because of the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the loss carryforwards
 the Company has established a valuation allowance
equal to the tax effect (26% - 21% federal and 5% state) of the loss carryforwards of approximately $160
000 and $9
300 at December
31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively
 and therefore
 no deferred tax asset has been recognized for the loss carryforwards. The change
in valuation allowance is approximately $139
000 and $6
600 for the periods ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively. The
tax effect of remaining NOL&#8217;s and resulting deferred tax assets remain fully reserved by valuation allowance
 due to continued
uncertainty as to their utilization. As of&#160;December 31
 2018&#160;and December 31
 2017
 there were no deferred taxes due
to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration.




of common stock is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding at the date of the consolidated financial statements.
The net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common
outstanding. As of&#160;December 31
 2018&#160;and December 31
 2017
 there are no potentially dilutive common stock equivalents.




 2018 we adopted
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Subtopic 606-10
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (&#8220;ASC 606-10&#8221;). The adoption of ASC 606-10 had no impact on prior year or previously
disclosed amounts. In accordance with ASC 606-10
 revenue is measured based on a consideration specified in a contract with a customer
and recognized when we satisfy the performance obligation specified in each contract.


of membership sales and whisky sales. Membership fees are charged to become a member with the ability to buy and sell rare or special
whisky casks as a group and to use this group to help make the investing in these whiskies more affordable. Whisky sales are from
the sale of the Company&#8217;s rare or special whisky inventory that has been acquired by the Company.


by selling membership fees and per-item sales of whisky. The membership fees are for a specified term. Membership fee revenue is
recognized through the term of the memberships. Whisky sale revenues are recognized when the whisky inventory items are sold. These
are per-item sales and all revenue is recognized upon the completion of the performance obligation to provide the sold item to
the buyer. Revenues are presented net of refunds
 credits and known and estimated credit card chargebacks. The Company reports
revenue net of any required taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities
 with the collected taxes recorded
as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.


2018
 the Company began selling cask fractions to members. Cask fractions are fractions of casks held in inventory that are sold
to members at GBP20.00 per fraction. When the Company sales these specific casks
 the sale amounts associated with these fractions
of the cask that have been sold are passed on to the members as returns on their investments. The Company retains a set percentage
of the sale amounts as their fee for facilitating the sale. The Cask fractions sold by the Company are recorded as deferred until
the casks are sold. As of December 31
 2018
 the Company had $75
158 in deferred revenues. The Company will hold these cask fractions
sales as deferred revenues based on the casks purchased and record revenue in line with the sale of the specific casks that have
been purchased by members.

 the income associated
with these cask fractions that have been purchased is passed on to the investors. The amounts of cask fractions sold totals $75

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.








instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. The company had $18
575 and
$81
118 in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.








subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places its cash with high quality

December 31
 2018 and 2017.








in the United States dollar and British Pounds Sterling and its reporting currency is the United States dollar. Management has
adopted ASC 830-20
All assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. For revenues and expenses
the weighted average exchange rate for the period is used. Gains and losses arising on translation of foreign currency denominated
transactions are included in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). Foreign currency&#160;transactions&#160;gains (losses) are recognized
in earnings in the period of settlement.









Loss

financial statements. At December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively
 the Company had $4
773 and $780 of accumulated other comprehensive
loss
 relating to foreign currency translation.








 the carrying
value of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.
ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value
 prescribes methods for measuring fair value
 and establishes a fair value hierarchy
to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:


prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.


prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets
 quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets
that are not active
 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable
 and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable
market data.


which reflect the reporting entity&#8217;s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the
asset or liability based on the best available information.


balance sheets for cash
 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair market value based on the short-term maturity
of these instruments.








 &#8220;Income Taxes
&#8221;
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that
some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has evaluated Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 regarding
the impact of the decreased tax rates of the Tax Cuts &#38; Jobs Act
 and have presented the Federal tax provision
 deferred tax
asset
 and valuation allowance using the new rates adjusted in the period of enactment. At December 31
 2018 and 2017 the Company
had net operating loss carryforwards (NOL&#8217;s) of approximately $613
683 and $43
249
 respectively
 which may be applied against
future taxable income and which expire beginning in 2037. However
 if certain substantial changes in the Company&#8217;s ownership
should occur
 there could be an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized. The
amount of and ultimate realization of the benefits from the operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes is dependent
in part
 upon the tax laws in effect
 the future earnings of the Company
 and other future events
 the effects of which cannot
be determined. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the loss carryforwards
 the Company has established a
valuation allowance equal to the tax effect (26% - 21% federal and 5% state) of the loss carryforwards of approximately $160
000
and $9
300 at December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively
 and therefore
 no deferred tax asset has been recognized for the loss
carryforwards. The change in valuation allowance is approximately $139
000 and $6
600 for the periods ended December 31
 2018
and 2017
 respectively. The tax effect of remaining NOL&#8217;s and resulting deferred tax assets remain fully reserved by valuation
allowance
 due to continued uncertainty as to their utilization. As of&#160;December 31
 2018&#160;and December 31
 2017
 there
were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration.








of common stock is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding at the date of the consolidated financial statements.
The net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common
outstanding. As of&#160;December 31
 2018&#160;and December 31
 2017
 there are no potentially dilutive common stock equivalents.








 2018 we adopted
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Subtopic 606-10
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (&#8220;ASC 606-10&#8221;). The adoption of ASC 606-10 had no impact on prior year or previously
disclosed amounts. In accordance with ASC 606-10
 revenue is measured based on a consideration specified in a contract with a customer
and recognized when we satisfy the performance obligation specified in each contract.


of membership sales and whisky sales. Membership fees are charged to become a member with the ability to buy and sell rare or special
whisky casks as a group and to use this group to help make the investing in these whiskies more affordable. Whisky sales are from
the sale of the Company&#8217;s rare or special whisky inventory that has been acquired by the Company.


by selling membership fees and per-item sales of whisky. The membership fees are for a specified term. Membership fee revenue is
recognized through the term of the memberships. Whisky sale revenues are recognized when the whisky inventory items are sold. These
are per-item sales and all revenue is recognized upon the completion of the performance obligation to provide the sold item to
the buyer. Revenues are presented net of refunds
 credits and known and estimated credit card chargebacks. The Company reports
revenue net of any required taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities
 with the collected taxes recorded
as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.


2018
 the Company began selling cask fractions to members. Cask fractions are fractions of casks held in inventory that are sold
to members at GBP20.00 per fraction. When the Company sales these specific casks
 the sale amounts associated with these fractions
of the cask that have been sold are passed on to the members as returns on their investments. The Company retains a set percentage
of the sale amounts as their fee for facilitating the sale. The Cask fractions sold by the Company are recorded as deferred until
the casks are sold. As of December 31
 2018
 the Company had $75
158 in deferred revenues. The Company will hold these cask fractions
sales as deferred revenues based on the casks purchased and record revenue in line with the sale of the specific casks that have
been purchased by members.

 including the policy for determining which items are treated as cash equivalents. Other information that may be disclosed includes (1) the nature of any restrictions on the entity's use of its cash and cash equivalents
 (2) whether the entity's cash and cash equivalents are insured or expose the entity to credit risk
 (3) the classification of any negative balance accounts (overdrafts)
 and (4) the carrying basis of cash equivalents (for example
 at cost) and whether the carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value.






















































































Disclosure of accounting policy for computing basic and diluted earnings or loss per share for each class of common stock and participating security. Addresses all significant policy factors
 including any antidilutive items that have been excluded from the computation and takes into account stock dividends
 splits and reverse splits that occur after the balance sheet date of the latest reporting period but before the issuance of the financial statements.

























































Disclosure of accounting policy for (1) transactions denominated in a currency other than the reporting enterprise's functional currency
 (2) translating foreign currency financial statements that are incorporated into the financial statements of the reporting enterprise by consolidation

Disclosure of accounting policy for income taxes
 which may include its accounting policies for recognizing and measuring deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowances
 recognizing investment tax credits
 operating loss carryforwards
 tax credit carryforwards
 and other carryforwards
 methodologies for determining its effective income tax rate and the characterization of interest and penalties in the financial statements.




























Disclosure of accounting policy for revenue recognition. If the entity has different policies for different types of revenue transactions
 the policy for each material type of transaction is generally disclosed. If a sales transaction has multiple element arrangements (for example
 delivery of multiple products
 services or the rights to use assets) the disclosure may indicate the accounting policy for each unit of accounting as well as how units of accounting are determined and valued. The disclosure may encompass important judgment as to appropriateness of principles related to recognition of revenue. The disclosure also may indicate the entity's treatment of any unearned or deferred revenue that arises from the transaction.
