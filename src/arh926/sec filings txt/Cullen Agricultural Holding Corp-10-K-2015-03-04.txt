Cullen Agricultural Holding Corp.
(the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) was incorporated in Delaware on August 27
 2009. References herein to &ldquo;we
&rdquo; &ldquo;us&rdquo;
We are seeking alternative strategic opportunities
to maximize stockholder value.




Corp. (&ldquo;Triplecrown&rdquo;)
 a blank check company. CAT Merger Sub
 Inc. (&ldquo;Merger Sub&rdquo;)
 a Georgia corporation
was incorporated as our wholly-owned subsidiary on August 31
 2009. We were formed in order to allow Triplecrown to complete a
business combination (the &ldquo;Merger&rdquo;) with Cullen Agricultural Technologies Inc. (&ldquo;Cullen Agritech&rdquo;)
 as
contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the &ldquo;Merger Agreement&rdquo;)
 dated as of September 4
 2009
 as
amended
 among us
 Triplecrown
 Merger Sub
 Cullen Agritech and Cullen Inc. Holdings Ltd. (&ldquo;Cullen Holdings&rdquo;). Cullen
Holdings is an entity controlled by Eric J. Watson
 our former Chief Executive Officer
 Secretary
 Chairman of the Board and Treasurer
and
 prior to the Merger
 was the holder of all of the outstanding common stock of Cullen Agritech.

Pursuant to the Merger
 (i) Triplecrown
merged with and into the Company with the Company surviving as the new publicly-traded corporation and (ii) Merger Sub merged with
and into Cullen Agritech with Cullen Agritech surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of the Merger
the former security holders of Triplecrown and Cullen Agritech became the security holders of the Company. Thus
 the Company became
a holding company
 operating through its wholly-owned subsidiary
 Cullen Agritech. The Merger was consummated on October 22


 the former shareholders of Triplecrown had an approximate 18% voting
interest in the Company and Cullen Holdings had an approximate 82% voting interest in the Company.

Following the Merger
 we conducted
our operations through Cullen Agritech. Cullen Agritech had conducted its operations primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiary
Natural Dairy Inc. (&ldquo;Natural Dairy&rdquo;). Our business plan following the Merger was to develop
 adapt and implement grazing-based
farming systems in regions of the world where the geophysical and climatic conditions are suitable for a pasture-based model. Upon
consummation of the Merger
 we acquired the intellectual property that made up our proprietary farming system and was the basis
for this business plan. The intellectual property included all constituent components of the proprietary farming system (including
forage growth and yields
 animal genetics and milking systems) that had been developed by adapting established grazing science
processes
 technology
 and genetics to liquid milk production in the Southeastern United States.


financing backed by the property we owned and operated to support our working capital needs and implement our business plan
 but
due to the performance of similar types of farming operations in the region
 as well as the general economic downturn
 financial
institutions were unwilling to provide such financing. As a result
 we were unable to obtain the necessary funding to support the
implementation of our business plan. Accordingly
 we began exploring all financing and strategic alternatives available to us.


 the Company disposed of approximately
3
635 acres of land
 constituting all of the Company&rsquo;s property which it had planned to use to deploy its pasture based dairy
and beef business plan. We used the capital received from such sales to support our working capital needs and retire certain of
our outstanding debt to reduce our interest obligations. During the year ended December 31
 2014
 the Company sold its farm equipment
related to the grazing-based farming system.

in forage and animal sciences to improve agricultural yields. The Company was formed to develop
 adapt and implement grazing-based
farming systems in regions of the world where the geophysical and climatic conditions are suitable for a pasture-based model. While
the potential for the pasture or grazing model is significant in many of the world&rsquo;s developed and developing economies
the systems are highly specific and require significant adaptation and modification to be successful. We had identified the global
dairy industry as a primary opportunity in which our systems can be applied to improve yields on land and drive cost-base efficiencies.
However
 we were unable to obtain the necessary funding to support the implementation of our business plan. Accordingly
 we began
exploring all financing and strategic alternatives available to us. As discussed below
 on December 31
 2014
 we entered into an
agreement to merge with an operating business.

Results of Operations and Financial
Condition


 2009
 our activities have been primarily focused
on raising capital to fund our former business plan and the sale of land to meet our working capital requirements and repay our
outstanding debt. As of December 31
 2014
 all of our outstanding debt has been repaid. Our current plan is to consummate the Mergers
and become an operating company. Prior to October 22
 2009
 we and our wholly-owned subsidiary were &ldquo;shell companies&rdquo;
and conducted no business operations and did not own or lease any real estate or other property. To date
 we have not generated
any revenue.&nbsp;




 2014
 we had a net loss of $443
144.
We did not generate any revenues during this period. Our expenses of $566

&quot;Income Taxes&quot; (&quot;ASC 740&quot;). ASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting
for income taxes and establishes for all entities a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of tax
positions
 and requires certain expanded disclosures. The provision for income taxes is based upon income or loss after adjustment
for those permanent items that are not considered in the determination of taxable income. Deferred income taxes represent the tax
effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates in
effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. We evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and
establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not
be realized. Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause
changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In management's opinion
 adequate provisions for income taxes have been made. If
actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates
 additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.

 it has been concluded that there are no significant
uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation was performed for tax years
of 2010 through 2014 which are open for tax authority review. We believe that our income tax positions and deductions will be sustained
on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to our financial position or results of operations.

 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not expect our uncertain tax position
to change during the next twelve months.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management is currently unaware of any issues under review that could result
in significant payments
 accruals or material deviations from its position.

senior management and the board of directors.


 2014
 our principal
executive and principal financial and accounting officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective.

Management&rsquo;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting


adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over
financial reporting is a process used to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and
the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
the United States. Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States
 and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
the authorization of our board of directors and management; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.



    
    



limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore
 even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. However
 these inherent limitations are known features of the financial
reporting process. Therefore
 it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce
 though not eliminate
 this risk.


 under the supervision of and
with the participation of the principal executive and principal financial and accounting officer
 assessed the effectiveness of
the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2014 based on criteria for effective control over
 (1992) created by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment
 the Company&rsquo;s management concluded that the Company&rsquo;s
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31
 2014.


not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting as such report is not required for non-accelerated filers.

 there were no
changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially
affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.




 no matter how well conceived and operated
can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud
 if any
 within a company have been detected. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable
assurance of achieving its objectives. Our principal executive and principal financial and accounting officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
 AND DIRECTOR




founders&rsquo; shares (that is
 shares held by the shareholders of Triplecrown prior to its initial public offering that became
our stockholders upon consummation of the Merger) are entitled to make up to two demands that we register such shares pursuant
to a registration rights agreement entered into with Triplecrown in connection with Triplecrown&rsquo;s initial public offering.
The holders of the majority of the founders&rsquo; shares can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time. In addition
these holders have certain &ldquo;piggy-back&rdquo; registration rights on registration statements filed subsequent to such date.
We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.


 2014
 the Company entered into a Sale and Purchase
Agreement with Hart pursuant to which the Company sold to Hart certain assets and intellectual property related to the Company&rsquo;s
former agricultural business for an aggregate of $125
000. Additionally
 in the event that Hart sells the intellectual property
subject to the agreement or licenses such intellectual property to a third party at any time prior to January 31
 2020
 the Company
will be entitled to 20% of the amount received from such sale or license.




 wherever possible
all related party transactions that could result in actual or potential conflicts of interest
 except under guidelines approved
by the board of directors (or the audit committee). Related-party transactions are defined as transactions in which (i) the aggregate
amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120
000 in any calendar year
 (ii) we or any of our subsidiaries is a participant
and (iii) any (a) executive officer
 director or nominee for election as a director
 (b) greater than 5 percent beneficial owner
of our common stock
 or (c) immediate family member
 of the persons referred to in clauses (a) and (b)
 has or will have a direct
or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10 percent beneficial owner of
another entity). A conflict of interest situation can arise when a person takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult
to perform his or her work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise if a person
 or a member of his or
her family
 receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position.


 pursuant to its written charter
 is responsible
for reviewing and approving related-party transactions to the extent we enter into such transactions. The audit committee will
consider all relevant factors when determining whether to approve a related party transaction
 including whether the related party
transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar
circumstances and the extent of the related party&rsquo;s interest in the transaction. No director may participate in the approval
of any transaction in which he is a related party
 but that director is required to provide the audit committee with all material
information concerning the transaction. Additionally
 we require each of our directors and executive officers to complete a directors&rsquo;
and officers&rsquo; questionnaire that elicits information about related party transactions. These procedures are intended to determine
whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part
of a director
 or officer.




a director is independent. As a result
 our board of directors consults with its counsel to ensure that the board&rsquo;s determinations
are consistent with those rules and all relevant securities and other laws and regulations regarding the independence of directors.
The NYSE Mkt requires that a majority of the board must be composed of &ldquo;independent directors
&rdquo; which is defined generally
as a person other than an officer of a company
 who does not have a relationship with the company that would interfere with the
director&rsquo;s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Consistent with these considerations
our board of directors has affirmatively determined that each of Kerry Kennedy
 Richard Y. Roberts and Edward Hanson will be our
independent directors. Additionally
 our board of directors has determined that Edward Hanson qualifies as an &ldquo;audit committee
financial expert
&rdquo; as defined under rules and regulations of the SEC.

 the transactions will be treated as
an acquisition of the Company by LIBB and as a recapitalization of LIBB

the Holdco shares and will exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the consolidated entity

805-10-55-11 through 55-15
 the merger or acquisition of a private operating company into a non-operating public shell with nominal
assets is considered a capital transaction in substance rather than a business combination.


 the combined entity will
become a new publicly traded company. Through December 31
 2014
 the Company has provided loans aggregating $1
500

The Merger Agreement between the Company and LIBB has not occurred and there is no assurance that such a merger will occur. The
Company&rsquo;s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties
 including the risk that the Company will not be
able to merge with a suitable operating business or that such operating business
 once acquired
 will not perform as expected.

 &quot;Income Taxes&quot; (&quot;ASC 740&quot;). ASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting
and reporting for income taxes and establishes for all entities a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the
benefit of tax positions
 and requires certain expanded disclosures. The provision for income taxes is based upon income or loss
after adjustment for those permanent items that are not considered in the determination of taxable income. Deferred income taxes
represent the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities
at the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company evaluates the recoverability
of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon
an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In management's opinion
 adequate provisions for income taxes
have been made. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates
 additional allowances or reversals of reserves
may be necessary.

Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting
Pronouncements


 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;)
issued Accounting Standards Update (&ldquo;ASU&rdquo;) No. 2014-10
 &ldquo;Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination
of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
 Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810
 Consolidation.&quot;
This ASU removes the definition of a development stage entity from the ASC
 thereby removing the financial reporting distinction
between development stage entities and other reporting entities from GAAP. In addition
 the ASU eliminates the requirements for
development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements of operations
 cash flows
 and stockholders&rsquo;
equity
 (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity
 (3) disclose a description of the development
stage activities in which the entity is engaged
 and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development
stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15
 2014
 and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to early adopt this ASU
effective with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30
 2014 and its adoption resulted in the removal of
previously required development stage disclosures. The adoption of ASU No. 2014-10 did not have a material effect on the Company&rsquo;s
consolidated financial statements.


 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09) &quot;Revenue
from Contracts with Customers.&quot; ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in &ldquo;Revenue Recognition
(Topic 605)&rdquo;
 and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an
amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU
2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods within that reporting
period. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09
on our consolidated financial statements.


 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15
 Presentation
of Financial Statements&mdash;Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&rsquo;s Ability to Continue
as a Going Concern. This standard is intended to define management&rsquo;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial
doubt about an organization&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. Under U.S.
GAAP
 financial statements are prepared under the presumption that the reporting organization will continue to operate as a going
concern
 except in limited circumstances. Financial reporting under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern
basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is critical to financial reporting because it establishes the fundamental
basis for measuring and classifying assets and liabilities. Currently
 U.S. GAAP lacks guidance about management&rsquo;s responsibility
to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the organization&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide
related footnote disclosures. This ASU provides guidance to an organization&rsquo;s management
 with principles and definitions
that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today
in the financial statement footnotes. The amendments are effective for annual periods ending after December 15
 2016
 and interim
periods within annual periods beginning after December 15
 2016. Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting
periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have
a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial position and results of operations.

000&lt;/font&gt; newly issued shares of Holdco common stock

 the number of shares of Holdco common stock to be received by the LIBB members at the closing will be reduced by a number of shares
 allocated among the LIBB members pro rata
 equal to such deficiency divided by $0.20. If LIBB&amp;#8217;s estimated net working capital at the closing is more than its net working capital target
 the number of shares of Holdco common stock to be received by the LIBB members at the closing will be increased by a number of shares

 a ready-to-drink

 the transactions will be treated as an acquisition of the Company by LIBB and as a recapitalization of LIBB
 as the former LIBB members will hold a large percent of the Holdco shares and will exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the consolidated entity and the Company was a public shell company at the time of the transaction. Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (&amp;#8220;ASC&amp;#8221;) 805-10-55-11 through 55-15

 the combined entity will become a new publicly traded company. Through December 31

000&lt;/font&gt; to LIBB. The Merger Agreement between the Company and LIBB has not occurred and there is no assurance that such a merger will occur. The Company&amp;#8217;s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties
 including the risk that the Company will not be able to merge with a suitable operating business or that such operating business

 &amp;#8220;Earnings Per Share&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;ASC 260&amp;#8221;). In accordance with ASC 260
 earnings per common share amounts (&amp;#8220;Basic EPS&amp;#8221;) are computed by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Earnings per common share amounts

 Income Taxes (ASC 740). ASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes and establishes for all entities a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of tax positions
 and requires certain expanded disclosures. The provision for income taxes is based upon income or loss after adjustment for those permanent items that are not considered in the determination of taxable income. Deferred income taxes represent the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In management's opinion
 adequate provisions for income taxes have been made. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates

 Property and Equipment
&amp;#8221; for purposes of determining and measuring impairment of its long-lived assets other than goodwill. The Company&amp;#8217;s policy is to review the value assigned to its long lived assets to determine if they have been permanently impaired by adverse conditions which may affect the Company whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the Company identifies a permanent impairment such that the carrying amount of the Company&amp;#8217;s long lived assets is not recoverable using the sum of an undiscounted cash flow projection
 the impaired asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value
 based on an estimate of future discounted cash flows which becomes the new cost basis for the impaired asset. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate undiscounted future operating cash flows and fair values and
 accordingly

 &amp;#8220;Earnings Per Share&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;ASC 260&amp;#8221;). In accordance with ASC 260
 earnings per common share amounts (&amp;#8220;Basic EPS&amp;#8221;) are computed by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Earnings per common share amounts

 Income Taxes (ASC 740). ASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes and establishes for all entities a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of tax positions
 and requires certain expanded disclosures. The provision for income taxes is based upon income or loss after adjustment for those permanent items that are not considered in the determination of taxable income. Deferred income taxes represent the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In management's opinion
 adequate provisions for income taxes have been made. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates

 Serif&gt; In June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&amp;#8220;ASU&amp;#8221;) No. 2014-10, &amp;#8220;Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation. This ASU removes the definition of a development stage entity from the ASC
 thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from GAAP. In addition
 the ASU eliminates the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements of operations
 cash flows
 and stockholders&amp;#8217; equity
 (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity
 (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged
 and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014
 and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to early adopt this ASU effective with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30

 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09) Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in &amp;#8220;Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)&amp;#8221;
 and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016

 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15
 Presentation of Financial Statements&amp;#151;Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&amp;#8217;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. This standard is intended to define management&amp;#8217;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. Under U.S. GAAP
 financial statements are prepared under the presumption that the reporting organization will continue to operate as a going concern
 except in limited circumstances. Financial reporting under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is critical to financial reporting because it establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying assets and liabilities. Currently
 U.S. GAAP lacks guidance about management&amp;#8217;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the organization&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. This ASU provides guidance to an organization&amp;#8217;s management
 with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. The amendments are effective for annual periods ending after December 15
 2016
 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15

&#8221; for purposes of determining and measuring impairment of its long-lived assets other than goodwill. The Company&#8217;s policy is to review the value assigned to its long lived assets to determine if they have been permanently impaired by adverse conditions which may affect the Company whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the Company identifies a permanent impairment such that the carrying amount of the Company&#8217;s long lived assets is not recoverable using the sum of an undiscounted cash flow projection
 the impaired asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value
 based on an estimate of future discounted cash flows which becomes the new cost basis for the impaired asset. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate undiscounted future operating cash flows and fair values and

 earnings per common share amounts (&#8220;Basic EPS&#8221;) are computed by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Earnings per common share amounts
 assuming dilution (&#8220;Diluted EPS&#8221;)
 gives effect to dilutive options
 warrants
 The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740
 Income Taxes (ASC 740). ASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes and establishes for all entities a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of tax positions
 and requires certain expanded disclosures. The provision for income taxes is based upon income or loss after adjustment for those permanent items that are not considered in the determination of taxable income. Deferred income taxes represent the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In management's opinion
 adequate provisions for income taxes have been made. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates
 The Company has identified its federal tax return and its state tax return in Georgia as major tax jurisdictions. Based on the Company's evaluation
 The Company&#8217;s policy for recording interest and penalties associated with tax audits is to record such items as a component of income tax expense. There were no amounts accrued for penalties and interest for years ended December 31
 2014 and December 31
 2013. The Company does not expect its uncertain tax position to change during the next twelve months. Management is currently unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments
 In June 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2014-10
 &#8220;Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
 Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810

 thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from GAAP. In addition
 the ASU eliminates the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements of operations
 cash flows
 and stockholders&#8217; equity
 (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity
 (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged
 and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014
 and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to early adopt this ASU effective with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30
 In May 2014
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09) Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in &#8220;Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)&#8221;
 and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 In August 2014
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15
 Presentation of Financial Statements&#151;Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&#8217;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. This standard is intended to define management&#8217;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. Under U.S. GAAP
 financial statements are prepared under the presumption that the reporting organization will continue to operate as a going concern
 except in limited circumstances. Financial reporting under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is critical to financial reporting because it establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying assets and liabilities. Currently
 U.S. GAAP lacks guidance about management&#8217;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the organization&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. This ASU provides guidance to an organization&#8217;s management
 with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. The amendments are effective for annual periods ending after December 15
 2016
 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15
 2016. Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position and results of operations.
