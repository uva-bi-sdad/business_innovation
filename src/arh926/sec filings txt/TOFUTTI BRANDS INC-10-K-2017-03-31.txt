PART
I

Item
1. Business.



We
are engaged in the development
 production and marketing of TOFUTTI&reg; brand non-dairy frozen desserts and other food products.
TOFUTTI products are soy-based
 vegan
 non-dairy products which contain no butterfat
 cholesterol or lactose. Our products are
100% milk free yet offer the same texture and full-bodied taste as their dairy counterparts. Our products are also free of cholesterol
and derive their fat from soy
 corn
 and palm
 all naturally lower in saturated fat than dairy products. With the exception of
Mintz&rsquo;s Blintzes
 all of our products are completely vegan and our soy-cheese products are gluten free as well. In addition
all of our products are certified kosher-parve and all of our soy-cheese products are also certified halal.

We
were organized under the laws of the State of New York in 1981 and became a Delaware corporation in 1984. Our registered office
and principal executive offices are located at 50 Jackson Drive
 Cranford
 New Jersey 07016
 our telephone number is 908-272-2400.
Our address on the Internet is www.tofutti.com. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual
report.



Our
objective is to be a leading provider of non-dairy
 vegan
 soy-based food products
 primarily frozen desserts and soy-cheese products
to supermarkets and health food stores in the United States and abroad. We intend to continue to introduce new products that offer
good taste while containing no butterfat
 cholesterol or dairy to these markets.

We
focus our marketing efforts toward those consumers who find our products essential to their everyday diets because of health
lifestyle or religious reasons. In order to broaden the use of our soy-cheese products
 we incorporate them into our branded food
products such as blintzes
 pizza
 and other frozen entr&eacute;e products. As part of this strategy
 we seek to achieve brand
awareness through product innovation
 eye-catching packaging
 trade advertising
 and a strong word-of-mouth marketing program.
We believe that our ability to offer a wide range of non-dairy
 vegan
 soy-based
 kosher-parve products will continue to provide
us with a competitive advantage.

On
September 30
 2016
 we announced that we had engaged a financial advisor and are pursuing strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder
value
 including a possible sale or other form of business combination. There can be no assurance that any transaction will be
consummated.

TOFUTTI
PRODUCT LINE

We
offer a broad product line of soy-based

 non-dairy products. Our non-dairy products include frozen desserts

MARKETING
AND DISTRIBUTION

TOFUTTI
products are sold and distributed across the United States and internationally
 and can be found in gourmet specialty shops
 kosher
supermarkets
 natural/health food stores
 and national and regional supermarket chains. All of our products are sold by independent
unaffiliated food brokers to distributors and sometimes on a direct basis to retail chain accounts or to warehouse accounts that
directly service chain accounts. Such direct accounts include Walmart
 Kroger
 Roundy&rsquo;s Supermarkets
 King Soopers
 Fred
Meyer
 Restaurant Depot
 DeMoulas/Market Basket
 Wakefern Food Corp.
 Associated Wholesale Grocers (AWG) and Ahold USA. Food brokers
act as our agents within designated territories or for specific accounts and receive commissions
 which average 5% of net collected
sales. Certain key domestic accounts and all international accounts are handled directly by us. Our products are also sold in
approximately thirty other countries.

We
currently sell our dairy-free frozen dessert products
 frozen entrees and soy-cheese products in most major markets in the United
States
 including Atlanta
 Baltimore
 Boston
 Charlotte
 Chicago
 Cincinnati
 Cleveland

 Miami
 Milwaukee
 Minneapolis
 Nashville
 New York
 Orlando
 Philadelphia
 Phoenix
 Portland
 Richmond
 Salt
Lake City
 San Diego
 San Francisco
 Seattle
 St. Louis
 Tampa and Washington
 D.C.

We
currently distribute all of our products by common carrier or by allowing customers to pick-up products from outside storage facilities.
We do not own
 lease or otherwise maintain any vehicles involved in the shipping of our products. From our co-packing facilities
we either ship direct to our customers or we ship to outside public storage facilities from which our customers are able to pick
up products. Use of outside storage facilities in several key locations in the United States allows us to provide our customers
with products in a timely fashion.


    
    


In
addition to ice cream and cheese distributors
 our products are handled by most major national and regional natural and/or gourmet
specialty distributors in the country. We distribute our products through forty-one (41) distributors in the national health food
market.

Our
sales to health food accounts in fiscal 2016 increased to $7
132
000
 or 49% of total sales
 from approximately $6
081
000
 or
44% of total sales
 in fiscal 2015. Our sales to the kosher market increased to $1
542
000
 or 11% of sales
 in fiscal 2016
 from
sales of approximately $1
436
000
 or 10% of sales
 in fiscal 2015.

During

 and Trinidad. Our distributor in England is our master distributor for all of Europe and part of
the Middle East
 excluding Israel
 and sells our products to approximately twenty other countries. Sales to foreign distributors
decreased to $2

000
 or 15% of sales
 in fiscal 2016
 from to $2
319
000
 or 17% of sales
 in fiscal 2015. We conduct all
of our foreign business in U.S. dollars. Accordingly
 our future export sales could be adversely affected by an increase in the
value of the U.S. dollar against local currencies
 which could increase the local currency price of our products.



TOFUTTI
frozen desserts compete with all forms of ice cream products
 yogurt-based desserts and other plant-based frozen desserts. We
believe that we are a leader in the non-dairy frozen dessert product market and offer the most complete line of non-dairy frozen
dessert products. Other plant-based frozen dessert products are presently being sold throughout the United States by established
manufacturers and distributors of ice cream and other frozen dessert products. The ice cream and frozen dessert industry is highly
competitive and most companies with whom we compete are substantially larger and have significantly greater resources than us.
All of our products face substantial competition from non-dairy and dairy products marketed by companies with significantly greater
resources than we have. Similar to our frozen desserts
 all our vegan cheese products face stiff competition within their category
from both dairy cheese products and plant-based cheese products.


    
    


In
most product categories
 we compete not only with widely advertised branded products
 but also with generic and private label
products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation
 product
quality
 price
 brand recognition and loyalty
 effectiveness of marketing
 promotional activity
 and the ability to identify and
satisfy consumer preferences. Our market share and ability to grow our revenue could also be adversely impacted if we are not
successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our
competitors. If we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality
 we may be unable
to maintain premium pricing over competitive products. We believe that we are able to compete effectively due to our ability to
offer an array of non-dairy frozen dessert
 soy-cheese and other food products that contain no butterfat
 cholesterol or lactose
and are 100% milk-free
 yet offer the same texture and full-bodied taste as their dairy counterparts.

PRODUCT
DEVELOPMENT

All
of our current products were developed by us in our own laboratory. David Mintz
 our Chief Executive Officer
 devotes a substantial
amount of his time and effort to new product development and product reformulation. In fiscal 2016 and 2015
 our product development
expenses were approximately $426
000 and $523
000
 respectively. These amounts do not include any portion of Mr. Mintz&rsquo;s
salary. All product development costs are expensed as incurred and are recorded as operating expenses in our financial statements.



We
believe that all of our products are produced under the strictest quality control procedures that are available in each manufacturing
facility used by us. These quality control procedures include
 but are not limited to
 the cleaning processes utilized prior to
running our products; spot line inspections during production; in-house laboratory testing as required by government agencies;
supervision of all our production by our kosher supervisory service; supervision of all our soy-cheese production by our halal
supervisory service; and random testing by outside independent laboratories to ensure that our internal quality control procedures
and guidelines are being properly followed.

All
of our products are produced by co-packers to whom we supply certain key ingredients and packaging for the manufacturing processes.
Our co-packing facilities are fully licensed and must comply with all state and federal laws and regulations. We currently utilize
six co-packers. Our co-packers manufacture and package our products and
 in certain instances
 warehouse such products pending
shipment. For certain key product categories
 such as non-dairy frozen desserts and non-dairy soy-based cheeses
 we have more
than one co-packer. In selecting an appropriate co-packer
 we take into account all of the preceding factors
 plus cost considerations
such as product processing fees and freight and warehouse expenses.

During
the years ended December 31
 2016 and January 2
 2016
 we purchased approximately 33% and 29% of our finished goods
 respectively
from Franklin Foods

 SOUR SUPREME
 and BETTER THAN RICOTTA
 respectively
of our finished goods from Ice Cream Specialties
 our frozen dessert novelty co-packer.

Relationships
with Co-Packers

We
do not have any written production agreements with our co-packers and do not anticipate that we would encounter any material difficulty
in obtaining alternative production sources
 at a comparable cost
 if one or all of our co-packers decide to terminate their relationships
with us. Nevertheless
 any disruption in supply could have a material adverse effect on our company.


    
    


In
order to protect our formulas
 we have entered into confidentiality arrangements with our co-packers and some of our co-packers&rsquo;
employees. All of our employees
 including officers
 sign similar confidentiality agreements. There can be no assurance that such
confidentiality arrangements can or will be maintained
 or that our trade secrets
 know-how and marketing ability cannot be obtained
by others
 or that others do not now possess similar or even more effective capabilities.

Kosher
Certification

KOF-K
Kosher Supervision
 or KOF-K
 of Teaneck
 New Jersey provides us with our kosher certification service. Before KOF-K will permit
its certification
 evidenced by its symbol
 to be placed on a product
 KOF-K must approve both the ingredients contained in the
product and the facility processing the product. Approval of the manufacturing facilities we use include periodic inspections
and in most cases
 on-site supervision of actual production. We pay a yearly renewal fee for certification and ongoing fees throughout
the year for supervisory services for each production run. We believe that our ability to successfully market and distribute our
products is dependent upon our continued compliance with the requirements of rabbinical certification. All TOFUTTI products meet
the requirements for certification as kosher-parve.

Halal
Certification

In
early 2013
 we completed a halal certification process at Franklin Foods
 the co-packer of our 
 products and at Whitehall Specialties
 the co-packer of our soy-cheese slices
and bulk Better Than Mozzarella products. This certification is provided by the Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America
(IFANCA) of Park Ridge
 Illinois and currently applies only to those products manufactured by Franklin Foods and Whitehall Specialties.
Before IFANCA will permit its certification to be placed on a product
 which is evidenced by its symbol
 IFANCA must approve both
the ingredients contained in the product and the facility processing the product. Approval of the manufacturing facilities we
use includes periodic inspections. There is a yearly renewal fee for certification. All TOFUTTI soy-cheese products meet the requirements
for certification as halal.

TRADEMARKS
AND PATENTS

We
have registered our trademark
 TOFUTTI&reg;
 and other trademarks for our frozen desserts and other products in the United States
and approximately thirty-seven foreign countries. We believe our trademarks are an important means of establishing consumer recognition
for our products and we will vigorously oppose any unauthorized use of our trademarks. We are not currently involved in any trademark
litigation.

Although
we believe that our formulas and processes are proprietary
 we have not sought patent protection for such technology. Instead
we are relying on the complexity of our technology
 on trade secrecy laws and on confidentiality agreements. We believe that our
technology has been independently developed and does not infringe the patents of others.

GOVERNMENT
REGULATION

Companies
engaged in the manufacture
 packaging and distribution of food items are subject to extensive regulation by various government
agencies which
 pursuant to statutes
 rules
 and regulations
 prescribe quality
 purity
 manufacturing and labeling requirements.
Food products are often subject to &ldquo;standard of identity&rdquo; requirements
 which are promulgated at either the Federal
or state level to determine the permissible qualitative and quantitative ingredient content of food. To the extent that any product
that we seek to market does not conform to an applicable standard
 special permission to market such a product is required.


    
    


Our
United States product labels are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration
 or the FDA. Such regulations
include standards for product descriptions
 nutritional claims
 label format
 minimum type sizes
 content and location of nutritional
information panels
 nutritional comparisons
 and ingredient content panels. Our labels
 ingredients and manufacturing processes
are subject to inspection by the FDA. We believe that we are in compliance with current labeling requirements and conduct periodic
reviews to make certain that such compliance is on-going.

The
Food
 Drug and Cosmetic Act
 the Food Safety Modernization Act and rules and regulations promulgated by the FDA thereunder
 contain
no specific Federal standard of identity which is applicable to our products. Our frozen dessert products meet the New York State
standard of identity for &ldquo;parevine
&rdquo; which has been adopted by at least eight other states. Many states require registration
and label review before food products can be sold. While approval in one jurisdiction generally indicates the products will meet
with approval in other jurisdictions
 there is no assurance that approval from other jurisdictions will be forthcoming. Additionally
many of our major customers now require that any food products that they purchase be produced in Safe Quality Food
 or SQF
 manufacturing
facilities. The SQF program is recognized by the Global Food Safety Initiative and provides a rigorous system to manage food safety
risks and provide safe products use by companies in the food industry. All of our current co-packers are SQF certified.

Food
manufacturing facilities are subject to inspections by various safety
 health and environmental regulatory authorities. A finding
of a failure to comply with one or more regulatory requirements can result in the imposition of sanctions including the closing
of all or a portion of a company&rsquo;s facilities
 subject to a period during which the company can remedy the alleged violations.
Our Cranford
 New Jersey facility is subject to inspection by the New Jersey-Kosher Enforcement Bureau and the New Jersey Environmental
Health Services. We believe that we
 our distributors and our co-packers are in compliance in all material respects with governmental
regulations regarding our current products and have obtained the material governmental permits
 licenses
 qualifications and approvals
required for our operations. Our compliance with Federal
 state and local environmental laws has not materially affected us either
economically or in the manner in which we conduct our business. However
 there can be no assurance that our company
 our distributors
and our co-packers will be able to comply with such laws and regulations in the future or that new governmental laws and regulations
will not be introduced that could prevent or temporarily inhibit the development
 distribution and sale of our products to consumers.

New
government laws and regulations may be introduced in the future that could result in additional compliance costs
 seizures
 confiscations
recalls or monetary fines
 any of which could prevent or inhibit the development
 distribution and sale of our products. If we
fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations
 we may be subject to civil remedies
 including fines
 injunctions
 recalls
or seizures
 as well as potential criminal sanctions
 which could have a material adverse effect on our business
 results of operations
and financial condition.



We
employed nine persons on a full-time basis on both December 31
 2016 and January 2
 2016. We do not have any collective bargaining
agreements with our employees.

Item
1A. Risk Factors.

Investing
in our common stock involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties
described below before investing in our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs
 our business prospects
 financial
condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case
 the value of our common stock could decline
 and you could
lose all or part of your investment.


    
    


Risks
Related to Our Business

We
may not be able to maintain profitable operations in the future. We may not have sufficient working capital to fund our operations
in the future.

While
we returned to profitable operations in fiscal 2016 after recording a 5% increase in revenues
 we incurred losses in fiscal 2015
and 2014. As of December 31
 2016
 we had $132
000 in cash and cash equivalents and our working capital was $2
949
000. The lack
of sufficient working capital could negatively impact our ability to introduce and adequately promote new products. To the extent
that we incur operating losses in the future or are unable to generate free cash flows from our business
 we may not have sufficient
working capital to fund our operations and will be required to obtain additional financing. Such financing may not be available
or
 if available
 may not be on terms satisfactory to us. If adequate funds are not available to us
 our business
 and results
of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.

We
are indebted to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer pursuant to a promissory note which is secured by substantially all of
our assets. Any failure to meet our obligations under the note could materially harm our business
 financial condition and results
of operations.

On
January 6
 2016
 we received a $500
000 loan from Mr. David Mintz
 our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. The
loan bears interest at 5% per annum and may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. The loan is
secured by substantially all of our assets and is convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $4.01 per
share. Initially due December 31
 2017

 2018.

In
the event we are unable to repay the loan
 or if there is an event of default
 without any action on the part of Mr. Mintz
 the
interest rate will increase to 12% per annum and the entire principal and interest balance under the loan
 and all of our other
obligations under the loan
 will be immediately due and payable
 and Mr. Mintz will be entitled to seek and institute any and

harm our business
 financial condition and results of operations.

We
depend on a few key distributors for a significant portion of our sales.

A
significant portion of our sales are to several key distributors
 which are large distribution companies with numerous divisions
and subsidiaries who act independently. Such distributors as a group accounted for 46% of our net sales in the fiscal year ended
December 31
 2016 and 44% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended January 2
 2016. Although we believe that the business associated
with any of our primary distributors can be readily transferred to other distributors or directly to supermarket warehouses if
necessary
 no assurance can be given that a change in distributors would not be disruptive to our business
 which could have a
material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

We
depend on several key suppliers to produce our products.

We
do not produce any of our own products. During the years ended December 31
 2016 and January 2
 2016
 we purchased approximately
33% and 29% of our finished goods
 respectively
 from Franklin Foods
 our 
 
 co-packer and 22% and 24%
 respectively
 of our finished goods from Ice Cream Specialties
 our
frozen dessert novelty co-packer. Although we believe that there will be no problem in continuing to obtain finished goods from
our current or alternative sources in the future
 any disruption in supply could have a material adverse effect on our company.


    
    


We
rely on a limited number of key executives to manage our business.

Our
success is significantly dependent on the services of David Mintz (age 85)
 Chief Executive Officer
 and Steven Kass (age 65)
Chief Financial Officer. The loss of the services of either of these persons could have a material adverse effect on our business
and results of operations.

Our
suppliers are subject to federal
 state and local government regulations that could adversely affect our business and financial
position.

Virtually
all food manufacturing operations are subject to regulation by various federal
 state and local government entities and agencies.
As producers of food products for human consumption
 our suppliers are subject to stringent production
 packaging
 quality
 labeling
and distribution standards
 including regulations mandated by the Federal Food
 Drug and Cosmetic Act
 the FDA
 OSHA
 the EPA
and the USDA. Future regulation by various federal
 state or local governmental entities or agencies could
 among other things
increase our suppliers&rsquo; cost of production
 cause them to incur unexpected expenditures or encumber productivity
 any of
which may adversely affect our business and financial results.

Our
ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive frozen dessert and health food markets may affect our operational performance
and financial results.

The
frozen dessert
 non-dairy cheese food and health food markets are highly competitive. In addition
 many of our principal competitors
are large
 diversified companies with resources significantly greater than ours. We expect strong competition to continue
 including
competition for adequate distribution and competition for the limited shelf space for the frozen dessert and non-dairy cheese
food categories in supermarkets and other retail food outlets. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation
product quality
 price
 brand recognition and loyalty
 effectiveness of marketing
 promotional activity
 and the ability to identify
and satisfy consumer preferences. Our market share and ability to grow our revenue could also be adversely impacted if we are
not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of
our competitors. If we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality
 we may
be unable to maintain premium pricing over competitive products.

From
time to time
 we and our customers experience price pressure in some of our markets as a result of competitors&rsquo; promotional
pricing practices as well as general market conditions. Our failure to match or exceed our competitors&rsquo; cost reductions
through innovative products and other improvements could weaken our competitive position. Competition is based on product quality
reliability
 food safety
 distribution effectiveness
 brand loyalty
 price
 effective promotional activities
 the ability to identify
and satisfy emerging consumer preferences and the ability to provide ancillary support services. We may not be able to compete
effectively with these larger
 more diversified companies.

A
material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.

We
are a consumer food products company and rely on continued demand for our products. To achieve business goals
 we must develop
and sell products that appeal to consumers. If demand and growth rates fall substantially below expected levels or our market
share declines significantly in these businesses
 our results could be negatively impacted. This could occur due to unforeseen
negative economic or political events or to changes in consumer trends and habits.


    
    


Our
operating costs are subject to fluctuations which could affect our business results.

The
principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather
product scarcity
 limited sources of supply
 commodity market fluctuations
 currency fluctuations
 and changes in governmental
agricultural and energy policies and regulations. Commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material
packaging
 and energy costs. Therefore
 our success is dependent
 in part
 on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations
through pricing actions
 cost savings projects and sourcing decisions. In the manufacturing and general overhead areas
 we need
to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements
 including any key sole supplier and manufacturing plant arrangements.

Economic
downturns and disruptions in financial markets can adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Our
results of operations can be materially affected by adverse conditions in the financial markets and depressed economic conditions
generally. Worsening economic conditions may result in diminished demand for our products and in decreased sales volumes. Recessionary
environments adversely affect the demand for our products as a result of constraints on discretionary spending by our retail customers.
In addition
 this could result in longer sales cycles
 slower acceptance of new products and increased competition for our products
which in turn could cause us to reduce prices for our products resulting in reduced gross margins. Any of these events would likely
harm our business
 operating results and financial condition.

In
addition
 the current economic climate
 and particularly the increased difficulty in securing credit
 could impact the ability
of our customers to purchase our products. Certain of our retail customers who have seen significant dampening of consumer demand
could face increased financial pressures that could impact their ability to purchase our products and make payments in a timely
manner. The continued high unemployment levels in the U.S. and the lingering effects of the global credit crisis
 will impact
the ability of our customers to purchase our products.

Natural
disasters
 terrorist attacks or breaches of network or information technology security could have an adverse effect on our business.

Natural
disasters
 cyber-attacks or other breaches of network or information technology (IT) security
 terrorist acts or acts of war may
cause disrupt our systems and operations. We expect that our inability to operate our facilities as a result of such events
 even
for a limited period of time
 may result in significant expenses and/or loss of market share to our competitors. While we maintain
insurance coverage for some of these events
 the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance
coverage we maintain. Any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition.

We
need to continue to introduce new products and packaging.

The
successful introduction of innovative products and packaging on a periodic basis has become increasingly important to our ability
to maintain and grow our sales. Accordingly
 the future degree of market acceptance of any of our new products
 and continued
acceptance of our current products
 which may be accompanied by significant promotional expenditures
 is likely to have an important
impact on our future financial results.

Our
operating results vary quarterly.

We
have often recognized a slightly greater portion of revenues in the second and third quarter of the year. We expect to continue
to experience slightly higher sales in the second and third quarters and slightly lower sales in the fourth and first quarters
as a result of reduced sales of non-dairy frozen desserts. In addition
 sales to our major customers fluctuate widely from period
to period and there is no way to accurately predict that their sales pattern from one year will be repeated in the corresponding
period of the next fiscal year. Due to the foregoing factors
 in some future quarter our operating results may be below the expectations
of investors. In such event
 it is likely that the price of our common stock would be materially adversely affected.


    
    


We
have no registered patents. The absence of patent protection could adversely affect our results of operations.

We
rely upon the confidentiality of our formulas and our know-how rather than upon patent protection. There is no assurance that
such confidentiality can or will be maintained or that our know-how cannot be obtained by others or that others do not now possess
similar or even more effective capabilities. The failure to maintain the confidentiality of our know-how could adversely affect
our operating results.

We
are subject to risks associated with international operations

In
fiscal 2016
 approximately 15% of our revenues were from international sales. Although we intend to expand our international operations
we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products. To the extent
that we cannot do so in a timely manner
 our business
 operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected. International
operations are subject to inherent risks
 including the following:



    
    
different
    and changing regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate or may operate in the future;

    
    
    

    
    
the
    impact of possible recessionary environments in multiple foreign markets;

    
    
    

    
    
export
    restrictions
 tariffs and other trade barriers;

    
    
    

    
    
difficulties
    in managing and supporting foreign operations;

    
    
    

    
    
longer
    payment cycles;

    
    
    

    
    
difficulties
    in collecting accounts receivable;

    
    
    

    
    
political
    and economic changes
 hostilities and other disruptions in regions where we currently sell or products or may sell our products
    in the future; and

    
    
    

    
    
seasonal
    reductions in business activities.


Negative
developments in any of these areas in one or more countries could result in a reduction in demand for our products
 the cancellation
or delay of orders already placed
 difficulty in collecting receivables
 and a higher cost of doing business
 any of which could
adversely affect our business
 results of operations or financial condition.

We
may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

Our
foreign transactions are always in U.S. dollars
 and to date we have not engaged in any currency hedging transactions intended
to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations. Therefore
 our future export
sales could be adversely affected by an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar
 which could increase the local currency price
of our products. Although exposure to currency fluctuations to date has not had a material effect on our business
 there can be
no assurance such fluctuations in the future will not materially and adversely affect our revenues from international sales and
consequently
 our business
 operating results and financial condition.


    
    


Product
liability suits
 if brought
 could have a material adverse effect on our business.

From
time to time in the normal course of our business
 we become subject to product liability claims. If a product liability claim
exceeding our insurance coverage were to be successfully asserted against us
 it could harm our business. We cannot assure you
that such coverage will be sufficient to insure against claims which may be brought against us
 or that we will be able to maintain
such insurance or obtain additional insurance covering existing or new products. As a marketer of food products
 we are subject
to the risk of claims for product liability. We maintain general product liability and umbrella insurance coverage and generally
require that our co-packers maintain product liability insurance with us as a co-insured. Similarly
 most of our customers require
us to name them as additional insureds as well
 and in some cases we are required to sign hold harmless and indemnification agreements.

If
our food products become adulterated or misbranded
 we would need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims
if consumers are injured as a result.

Food
products occasionally contain contaminants due to inherent defects or improper storage or handling. Under adverse circumstances
food producers may be required to recall some of their products if they become adulterated or misbranded or as a result of a government-mandated
recall. The scope of such a recall could result in significant costs incurred as a result of the recall
 potential destruction
of inventory
 and lost sales. Should consumption of any product cause injury
 we may be liable for monetary damages as a result
of a settlement or judgment against us. A widespread product recall could result in changes to one or more of our business processes
product shortages
 a loss of customer confidence in our brand or other adverse effects on our business.

Our
failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have an
adverse effect on our financial results and the market price of our common stock.

The
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposes certain duties on us and our executives and directors. Our efforts to comply with the requirements
of Section 404 have resulted in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management time and attention
and we expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of resources. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us
to provide management&rsquo;s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in connection with
the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for each fiscal year. Based on their evaluation under the frameworks described above
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective
as of December 31
 2016 because of the following material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting:



    
    
a
    continuing lack of sufficient resources and an insufficient level of monitoring and oversight
 which may restrict our ability
    to gather
 analyze and report information relative to the financial statements in a timely manner.

    
    
    

    
    
The
    limited size of the accounting department makes it impracticable to achieve an optimum separation of duties.


Our
failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could result in investigation or sanctions by regulatory
authorities
 and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results
 investor confidence in our reported financial
information
 and the market price of our common stock.


    
    


Risks
Relating to Our Common Stock

There
of

 and speculation and uncertainty
may adversely impact our
business.

On
September 30
 2016
 we announced that we had engaged a financial advisor and are pursuing strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder
value
 including a possible sale or other form of business combination. There can be no assurance that any transaction will be
consummated. The process of exploring strategic alternatives will involve the dedication of significant resources and the incurrence
of significant costs and expenses. In addition
 speculation and uncertainty regarding our exploration of strategic alternatives
may cause or result in:



    
    
disruption
    of our business;

    
    
    

    
    
distraction
    of our management and employees;

    
    
    

    
    
difficulty
    in maintaining or negotiating and consummating new
 business or strategic relationships or transactions;

    
    
    

    
    
increased
    stock price volatility; and

    
    
    

    
    
increased
    costs and advisory fees.


If
strategic
alternatives

results
and financial condition.

Our
principal shareholder has the ability to control the policies and management of our company.

Our
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
 David Mintz
 holds 2
630
440 shares of common stock representing approximately
51.0% of the outstanding shares. For as long as Mr. Mintz has a controlling interest in our company
 he will have the ability
to exercise a controlling influence over our business and affairs
 including any determinations with respect to potential mergers
or other business combinations involving us
 our acquisition or disposition of assets
 our incurrence of indebtedness
 our issuance
of any additional common shares or other equity securities
 our repurchase or redemption of common shares and our payment of dividends.
Similarly
 as long as Mr. Mintz has a controlling interest in our company
 he will have the power to determine the outcome of
matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders
 including the power to elect all of the members of our board of directors and
prevent an acquisition or any other change in control of us.

Trading
on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets may be volatile and sporadic
 which could depress the market price of our common stock and
make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares.

Since
October 24
 2016 our common stock has been quoted on the OTCQB tier of the electronic quotation system operated by OTC Markets.
Trading in stock quoted on the OTC Markets is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices
 due to many
factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of
our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover
 the OTC Markets is not a stock exchange
 and trading
of securities on the OTC Markets is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like NASDAQ
or a stock exchange like the NYSE MKT. Accordingly
 shareholders may have difficulty reselling any of their shares and the lack
of liquidity may negatively impact our ability to pursue strategic alternatives.


    
    


Penny
stock rules will limit the ability of our stockholders to sell their stock.

The
Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; to be any equity security
that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share
 subject to certain
exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules
 which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers
who sell to persons other than established customers and &ldquo;accredited investors.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;accredited investor&rdquo;
refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5
000
000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1
000
000 or
annual income exceeding $200
000 or $300
000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer
 prior to
a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules
 to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form
prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission
 which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of
risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the
penny stock
 the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing
the market value of each penny stock held in the customer&rsquo;s account. The bid and offer quotations
 and the broker-dealer
and salesperson compensation information
 must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction
and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer&rsquo;s confirmation. In addition
 the penny stock rules
require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules
 the broker-dealer must make a special
written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser&rsquo;s written
agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the
secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently
 these penny stock rules may affect the
ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit
the marketability of our common stock.

The
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
 or FINRA
 has adopted sales practice requirements which may also limit a shareholder&rsquo;s
ability to buy and sell our stock.

In
addition to the penny stock rules described above
 FINRA has adopted rules that require that
 in recommending an investment to
a customer
 a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior
to recommending speculative
 low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers
 broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts
to obtain information about the customer&rsquo;s financial status
 tax status
 investment objectives and other information. Under
interpretations of these rules
 FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative
 low-priced securities will not
be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their
customers buy our common stock
 which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market
for its shares.

Volatility
of the market price of our common stock could adversely affect our shareholders and us.

The
market price of our common stock has been subject to fluctuations in the past and may be subject to wide fluctuations in response
to numerous factors
 including the following:



    
    
actual
    or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or those of our competitors;

    
    
    

    
    
announcements
    by us or our competitors of new and enhanced products;

    
    
    

    
    
developments
    or disputes concerning proprietary rights;

    
    
    

    
    
introduction
    and adoption of new industry standards;

    
    
    

    
    
market
    conditions or trends in our industry;

    
    
    

    
    
announcements
    by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions;

    
    
    

    
    
entry
    into strategic partnerships or joint ventures by us or our competitors;

    
    
    

    
    
additions
    or departures of key personnel;

    
    
    

    
    
political
    and economic conditions
 such as a recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations or political events; and

    
    
    

    
    
other
    events or factors in any of the countries in which we do business
 including those resulting from war
 incidents of terrorism
    natural disasters or responses to such events.



    
    


In
addition
 in recent years the stock market has been highly volatile. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may materially
adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares
 regardless of our performance. In the past
 following periods of market
volatility
 shareholders have often instituted securities class action litigation relating to the stock trading and price volatility
of the company in question. If we were involved in any securities litigation
 it could result in substantial cost to us to defend
and divert resources and the attention of management from our business.

We
do not intend to pay cash dividends.

Our
policy is to retain earnings
 if any
 for use in our business and
 for this reason
 we do not intend to pay cash dividends on
our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future.

Our
facilities are located in a one-story facility in Cranford
 New Jersey. The 6
200 square foot facility houses our administrative
offices
 a warehouse
 walk-in freezer and refrigerator
 and a product development laboratory and test kitchen. Our lease agreement
expired in 1999
 but we continue to occupy the premises under the terms of that agreement
 subject to a six month notification
period from us and the landlord with respect to any changes. We currently have no plans to enter into a long-term lease agreement
for the facility. Our rent expense was $81
000 and $82
000 in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015
 respectively. Our management believes
that the Cranford facility will continue to satisfy our space requirements for the foreseeable future. We rent warehouse storage
space at various outside facilities. Outside warehouse expenses amounted to $503
000 and $513
000 during fiscal 2016 and 2015
respectively.

Holders
of Record

As
of March 28
 2017
 there were approximately 399 direct holders of record of our common stock.



We
have not paid and have no present intention of paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.

2014
Equity Incentive Plan

Our
shareholders adopted our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the &ldquo;Plan&rdquo;) on June 10
 2014. As of December 31
 2016
 we
had issued 80
000 non-qualified stock option awards under the Plan. The Plan will expire on June 9
 2024. The Plan
provides for grants of various types of awards (&ldquo;Awards&rdquo;) that are designed to attract and retain highly
qualified employees and directors who will contribute to the success of the company and to provide incentives to participants
in this Plan that are linked directly to increases in shareholder value which will
 therefore
 inure to the benefit of all of
our shareholders. The Plan makes 250
000 shares of our common stock available for Awards under the Plan. The Plan also
permits performance-based Awards paid under the Plan to be tax deductible to the company as &ldquo;performance-based
compensation&rdquo; under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended (the &ldquo;Code&rdquo;). 



The
Plan is administered in accordance with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code (but only to the extent necessary and desirable
to qualify Awards under the Plan as &ldquo;performance-based compensation&rdquo; under Section 162(m)) and
 to the extent applicable
Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act (&ldquo;Rule 16b-3&rdquo;)
 by the Board or
 at the Board&rsquo;s sole discretion
 by the compensation
or any other committee of the Board
 as appointed by the Board (the &ldquo;Administrator&rdquo;).


    
    


Eligible
Participants

Incentive
stock options
 or ISOs
 may be granted only to employees (including officers and directors who are also employees) of the company.
Options and stock appreciation rights may be granted only to eligible participants as to whom company shares constitute &ldquo;service
recipient stock
&rdquo; within the meaning of the regulations under Section 409A of the Code. All other Awards may be granted
to employees
 officers and directors of the company. An Eligible Participant may be granted more than one Award under the Plan.

The
Plan allows us to grant ISOs to our employees and non-statutory stock options
 stock appreciation rights
 restricted stock
 performance
grants
 stock bonuses and any other types of equity-based awards to our employees
 officers and directors. We believe that our
ability to grant this broad array of equity incentives is critical to secure
 retain and motivate our employees and directors
and to respond to market conditions and best practices
 while at the same time balancing such issuances and the potential dilution
to our stockholders.

Sales
of Unregistered Securities

There
were no sales of unregistered securities during fiscal 2016.

Purchase
of Equity Securities By the Issuer and Affiliates

We
did not purchase any shares of our common stock in the thirteen weeks ended December 31
 2016 (the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016).

Item
7. Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The
following is management&rsquo;s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors which have affected our financial position
and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying audited financial statements.

Critical
Accounting Policies

Our
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The policies discussed below are considered by management
to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on
management&rsquo;s judgment
 with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently
uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs. For all of these policies
management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast
 and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.


    
    


Revenue
Recognition
four criteria have been met: (i) the product has been shipped and we have no significant remaining obligations; (ii) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists; (iii) the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is probable. We
record as deductions against sales all trade discounts
 returns and allowances that occur in the ordinary course of business
when the sale occurs. To the extent we charge our customers for freight expense
 it is included in freight out expense in cost
of goods sold. The amount of freight costs charged to customers has not been material to date.

Accounts
Receivable
Credit is extended based on evaluation of a customers&rsquo; financial condition and
 generally
 collateral is not required. Accounts
receivable are most often due within 30 to 90 days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful
accounts. Accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due. We determine whether an allowance
is necessary by considering a number of factors
 including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due
 our previous
loss history
 the customer&rsquo;s current ability to pay its obligation
 and the condition of the general economy and the industry
as a whole. We write-off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible
 and payments subsequently received on such receivables
are credited to the bad debt expense account. We do not accrue interest on accounts receivable past due.

Fixed
Assets
at cost
 less accumulated depreciation. The automobile is being depreciated on a straight line basis over a period of five years.

Inventory.

demand are written down and charged to the provision for inventories. At the point of which loss is recognized
 a new
 lower cost
basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or
increase in the newly established cost basis.

Income
Taxes
to realize the deferred tax assets based on estimates and assumptions. If these estimates and assumptions change in the future
we may be required to record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets which could result in additional income tax expense.
We will recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management&rsquo;s assessment
is that the position is &ldquo;more likely than not&rdquo; (i.e.
 a likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax
jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term &ldquo;tax position&rdquo; refers to a position in
a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current
or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In
June 2016
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
 or ASU 2016-13
 Financial Instruments (Topic 326)- Credit Losses
 Measurement
of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
 which provides guidance regarding the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments.
The new guidance replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in the current guidance with a methodology that reflects expected
credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to determine credit loss
estimates. This ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 with early adoption permitted for fiscal
years beginning after December 15
 2018. We are in the process of assessing the impact of this guidance on our financial statements.

In
March 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-09
 Stock Compensation
 which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based
payment transactions
 including the income tax consequences
 classification of awards as either equity or liabilities
 and classification
on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 and interim periods
within those annual periods. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its financial statements.

In
February 2016
 the FASB issued guidance which amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting
 including requiring
lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. This guidance will
be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption
is permitted. The new leases standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at
 or entered
into after
 the date of initial application
 with an option to use certain transition relief. We are currently evaluating the
impact of adopting the new leases standard on our financial statements.

In
November 2015
 the FASB issued guidance that eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities
and assets as current and non-current in a classified balance sheet. Instead
 organizations will be required to classify all deferred
tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The amendments apply to all organizations that present a classified balance sheet. This
amendment is effective for our company for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2016 and
interim periods within those annual periods. We have not yet adopted this guidance but do not expect the adoption of this guidance
will have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures.

In
July 2015
 the FASB issued guidance which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to
the lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 defines net realizable value as estimated selling pricings in the ordinary
course of business
 less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal
 and transportation. The new guidance must be applied
on a prospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods within those
fiscal years
 with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our
financial statements and related disclosures.

In
2015
 the FASB issued an accounting standards update which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one
year. The update applies to all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services and is effective
for public companies for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2017. Early application is permitted
only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim reporting periods within that reporting
period. We are currently evaluating the requirements of this update and have not yet determined its impact on our financial statements.


    
    


In
August
 2014
 the FASB issued guidance that requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise
doubt
about an entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. If such conditions or events exist
 disclosures are required that
enable users of the financial statements to understand the nature of the conditions or events
 management&rsquo;s evaluation of
the circumstances and management&rsquo;s plans to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity&rsquo;s
ability to continue as a going concern. This standard became effective for us in the annual period ending December 31
 2016. The
adoption of this guidance is not expected to impact our financial position
 results of operations or cash flows.

Key
Factors Affecting Our Business

Our
operations and the operating metrics discussed
below have been
 and will likely continue to be affected by certain key factors as well as certain historical events and actions.
The key factors affecting our business and results of operations include among others
 our lack of sufficient working capital
lack of profitable operations in recent years
 dependence on a few key distributors for a significant portion of our sales
 dependence
on several key suppliers to produce our products
 our reliance on a limited number of key executives to manage our business
 and
competition. For further discussion of the factors affecting our results of operations
 see &ldquo;Risk Factors.&rdquo;

We
may not be able to maintain profitability in the future and may not have sufficient working capital to fund our operations in
the future.

While
we returned to profitable operations in fiscal 2016 after recording a 5% increase in revenues
 we incurred losses in fiscal 2015
and 2014. As a result of our losses
 our cash and cash equivalents and working capital were negatively affected
 declining to
$55
000 and $2
003
000
 respectively
 as of January 2
 2016. With our improved results in fiscal 2016
 our cash and cash equivalents
and working capital increased to $132
000 and $2
949
000
 respectively
 as of December 31
 2016. The lack of sufficient working
capital could negatively impact our ability to introduce and adequately promote new products. To the extent that we incur operating
losses in the future or are unable to generate free cash flows from our business
 we may not have sufficient working capital to
fund our operations and will be required to obtain additional financing. Such financing may not be available
 or
 if available
may not be on terms satisfactory to us. If we are unable to maintain revenues
 we may not be able sustain profitable operations
in the future or generate positive cash flows from our operations.

We
depend on a few key distributors for a significant portion of our sales.

A
significant portion of our sales are to several key distributors
 which are large distribution companies with numerous divisions
and subsidiaries who act independently. Such distributors as a group accounted for 46% and 44% of our net sales for the fiscal
years ended December 31
 2016 and January 2
 2016
 respectively. Although we believe that the business associated with any of
our primary distributors can be readily transferred to other distributors or directly to supermarket warehouses if necessary
no assurance can be given that a change in distributors would not be disruptive to our business
 which could have a material adverse
effect on our business and results of operations.

We
depend on several key suppliers to produce our products.

We
do not produce any of our own products. During the years ended December 31
 2016 and January 2
 2016
 we purchased approximately
33% and 29% of our finished goods
 respectively
 from Franklin Foods
 our 
 
 co-packer and 22% and 24%
 respectively
 of our finished goods from Ice Cream Specialties
 our
primary frozen dessert novelty co-packer. Although we believe that there will be no problem in continuing to obtain finished goods
from our current or alternative sources in the future
 any disruption in supply could have a material adverse effect on our company.


    
    


We
rely on a limited number of key executives to manage our business.

Our
success is significantly dependent on the services of David Mintz (age 85)
 Chief Executive Officer
 and Steven Kass (age 65)
Chief Financial Officer. The loss of the services of either of these persons could have a material adverse effect on our business
and results of operations.



The
frozen dessert
 non-dairy cheese food and health food markets are highly competitive. In addition
 many of our principal competitors
are large
 diversified companies with resources significantly greater than ours. We expect strong competition to continue
 including
competition for adequate distribution and competition for the limited shelf space for the frozen dessert and non-dairy cheese
food categories in supermarkets and other retail food outlets.

From
time to time
 we and our customers experience price pressure in some of our markets as a result of competitors&rsquo; promotional
pricing practices as well as general market conditions. Our failure to match or exceed our competitors&rsquo; cost reductions
through innovative products and other improvements could weaken our competitive position. Competition is based on product quality
reliability
 food safety
 distribution effectiveness
 brand loyalty
 price
 effective promotional activities
 the ability to identify
and satisfy emerging consumer preferences and the ability to provide ancillary support services. We may not be able to compete
effectively with these larger
 more diversified companies.

Fiscal
Year Ended December 31
 2016 Compared with Fiscal Year Ended January 2
 2016

We
operate on a fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal years for the financial statements included in
this report are the fifty-two week period ended December 31
 2016 (fiscal 2015) and the fifty-three week period ended January
2
 2016 (fiscal 2015).

Net
sales for the fiscal year ended December 31
 2016 were $14
473
000
 an increase of $709
000
 or 5%
 from net sales of $13
764
000
for the fiscal year ended January 2
 2016. Sales in our frozen dessert product line decreased to $3
449
000 in fiscal 2016 from
$3
866
000 in fiscal 2015. Our frozen dessert business continues to be negatively impacted by the overall sluggish sales in the
ice cream category. Sales of soy-cheese products increased to $10
863
000 in fiscal 2016 from $9
311
000 in fiscal 2015. Sales
of our soy-cheese products were positively impacted by the elimination of various sales promotions
 which increased the net selling
prices of our products in the 2016 period. Sales of our frozen food entr&eacute;e products decreased to $161
000 in fiscal 2015
from $587
000 in fiscal 2015. Sales of frozen food entr&eacute;e products
 which consist of pizza and blintzes
 decreased primarily
were primarily impacted by consumer

three-slice package it replaced.

Our
gross profit in the year ended December 31
 2016 increased by $993
000 to $4
591
000 from $3
598
000
 reflecting the increase
in our sales and gross profit percentages. Our gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31
 2016 increased to 32% from
26% for the year ended January 2
 2016
 due to the implementation of price increases in 2016 and the elimination of various sales
promotion programs in 2016. Freight out expense increased to $943
000 for the year ended December 31
 2016 compared with $857
000
for the year ended January 2
 2016 due to the increase in sales. Freight out cost as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2016 was


in future periods through selective price increases and selective ingredient replacements to lower cost alternatives.

Selling
and warehousing expenses decreased by $157
000
 or 10%
 to $1
393
000 for fiscal 2016 from $1
550
000 in fiscal 2015. This decrease
was primarily attributable to decreases in bad debt expense of $51
000
 commission expense of $43
000
 meetings and conventions
expense of $41
000
 outside warehouse rental expense of $10
000
 and messenger expense of $9
000. We anticipate that selling expenses
in 2017 should be comparable to or slightly less than our expenses in 2016.


    
    


Marketing
expenses decreased in fiscal 2016 by $119
000
 or 33%
 to $238
000 from $357
000 in fiscal 2015 due to decreases in advertising
expense of $76
000
 public relations expense of $17
000
 artwork and plates expense of $15
000
 and promotion expense of $8
000.
We expect marketing expenses to decline in fiscal 2017 due to the elimination of certain promotion and advertising programs.

Product
development expenses decreased by $97
000
 or 19%
 to $426
000 in fiscal 2016 from $523
000 in fiscal 2015. The decrease was primarily
attributable to decreases in payroll expense of $52
000
 lab costs and supplies of $29
000
 and professional fees and outside
services expense of $28
000. We expect product development costs to remain constant or decline slightly in fiscal 2017.

General
and administrative expenses increased by $171
000
 or 9%
 to $2
059
000 for fiscal 2016 from $1
888
000 for fiscal 2015. The increase
was due primarily due to increases in professional fees and outside services expense of $215
000
 payroll expense of $49
000
travel
 entertainment and auto expense of $36
000
 public relations expense of $21
000
 general insurance expense of $15
000
equipment rental expense of $10
000
 real estate property tax expense of $9
000
 IT expense of $9
000
 and building repair and
maintenance expense of $7
000. These expenses were partially offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of $86
000. The
increase in professional fees and outside services expense was due principally to litigation and related legal expenses of $265
000.
Our management expects that general and administrative expenses in 2017 will decrease significantly with the resolution of the
litigation.

Overall
total operating expenses in fiscal 2016 decreased by $202
000
 or 5%
 to $4
116
000 compared to total operating expenses of $4
318
000
in fiscal 2015. We anticipate that our operating expenses in fiscal 2017 will decrease due to reductions in sales
 marketing
and general and administrative expenses.

Income
before income taxes increased to $449
000 in fiscal 2016 as compared with a loss of $721
000 in fiscal 2015.

Income
tax expense for the 2016 fiscal period was $28
000 compared to income tax benefit of $78
000 for the 2015 fiscal period. The income
tax expense in fiscal 2016 was due to our return to profitable operations in fiscal 2016.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Our
recent operating history has resulted in a decrease in our capital resources. At December 31
 2016
 we had approximately $132
000
in cash and cash equivalents
 and our working capital was $2
949
000
 an increase of $946
000 from January 2
 2016. Our current
and quick acid test ratios
 both measures of liquidity
 were 2.9 and 1.9
 respectively
 as of December 31
 2016 and 2.4 and 1.4
respectively
 as of January 2
 2016.

In
order to provide our company with additional working capital
 on January 6
 2016
 David Mintz
 our Chairman and Chief Executive
provided our company with a loan of $500
000 which is secured by substantially all of our assets and is due on December 31
 2018.
Interest of 5% is payable on a quarterly basis without compounding. The loan may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without
premium or penalty. The loan is convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of $4.01 per share
 the closing price
of our common stock on the NYSE MKT on the date the promissory note was entered into. Initially due December 31
 2017
 the loan

 2018.

Cash

 2016 compared with cash used in operating activities
of $280
000 for the fiscal year ended January 2
 2016. In the fiscal year ended December 31
 2016
 our cash flow from operating
activities reflected net income of $421
000
 offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory of $897
000 and $92
000
respectively.

Cash
provided by financing activities was $495
000 for the fiscal year ended December 31
 2016 compared to $6
000 used in financing
activities for the fiscal year ended January 2
 2016. Net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended December
31
 2016 was the result of a $500
000 loan from our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.

As
a result of the foregoing
 our cash and cash equivalents increased to $132
000 at December 31
 2016 from $55
000 at January 2
2016.

We
believe our existing cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31
 2016
 existing working capital
 and our expected cash flows
from operations will be sufficient to support our operating and capital requirements during the next twelve months. However
 we
may require additional financing in order to carry out our business plans for future periods.

Contractual
Obligations

We
had no material contractual obligations at December 31
 2016.

Inflation
and Seasonality

We
do not believe that our operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the preceding two years. There can
be no assurance
 however
 that our operating results will not be affected by inflation in the future. Our business is subject
to minimal seasonal variations with slightly increased sales historically in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year.
We expect to continue to experience slightly higher sales in the second and third quarters
 and slightly lower sales in the fourth
and first quarters
 as a result of reduced sales of non-dairy frozen desserts during those periods.

Market
Risk

We
will invest our excess cash
 should there be any
 in highly rated money market funds which are subject to changes in short-term
interest rates. We do not believe that our foreign currency exposure is significant as our export sales are transacted in U.S.
dollars. We did not enter into any foreign exchange contracts in the year ended December 31
 2016.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board
of Directors and Stockholders of
Tofutti
Brands
 Inc.

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Tofutti Brands
 Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of December 31
 2016 and January
2
 2016
 and the related statements of operations
 changes instockholders&rsquo; equity
 and cash flows for each of the fiscal
years then ended. The financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining
on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion
 the financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects

NOTE
1: LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

At
December 31
 2016
 Tofutti Brands
 Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) had approximately $132 in cash compared to $55 at January
2
 2016. Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31
 2016 was $418 compared to $280 used in operating
activities for the year ended January 2
 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31
 2016
was primarily the result of our net income of $421 offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory of $897 and $92
 respectively.

Cash
provided by financing activities was $495 for the fiscal year ended December 31
 2016 compared to $6 used in financing activities
for the fiscal year ended January 2
 2016. Net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended December 31
 2016
was the result of a $500 loan from the Company&rsquo;s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.

The
Company has historically financed operations and met capital requirements primarily through positive cash flow from operations.
However
 due to the net loss and cash used in operations for the year ended January 2
 2016 in order to provide the Company with
additional working capital
 on January 6
 2016
 David Mintz
 the Company&rsquo;s Chairman and Chief Executive
 provided it with
a loan of $500
000. Commencing March 31
 2016
 interest of 5% is payable on a quarterly basis without compounding. The loan may
be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. The loan is convertible into the Company&rsquo;s common
stock at a conversion price of $4.01 per share
 the closing price of its common stock on the NYSE MKT on the date the promissory
note was entered into. Initially due December 31
 2017

2018.

The
Company&rsquo;s ability to introduce successful new products may be adversely affected by a number of factors
 such as unforeseen
cost and expenses
 economic environment
 increased competition
 and other factors beyond the Company&rsquo;s control. Management
cannot provide assurance that the Company will operate profitably in the future
 or that it will not require significant additional
financing in order to accomplish or exceed the objectives of its business plan. Consequently
 the Company&rsquo;s historical operating
results cannot be relied on to be an indicator of future performance
 and management cannot predict whether the Company will obtain
or sustain positive operating cash flow or generate net income in the future.

On
September 30
 2016
 the Company announced that it had engaged a financial advisor and is pursuing strategic alternatives to enhance
shareholder value
 including a possible sale or other form of business combination. There can be no assurance that any transaction
will be consummated.

NOTE
2: DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Description
of Business
the development
 production and marketing of non-dairy frozen desserts and other food products.

Operating
companies

While the Company has multiple products and or product groups
 its goal is to focus on non-dairy foods. The Company&rsquo;s chief
operating decision maker tracks revenue by product groups
 but does not track more granular operating results by product group
as many of the ingredients are similar amongst these groups. As a result
 the Company has determined that it has only one operating
segment
 which is the development
 production and marketing of soy-based
 non-dairy frozen desserts
 frozen food products and
soy-based cheese products.

Fiscal
Year
statements included herein are the fifty-two week fiscal period ended on December 31
 2016 and the fifty-three week period fiscal
ended January 2
 2016.

Estimates
and Uncertainties
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include allowance for doubtful accounts
 sales promotion
accruals
 inventory reserves and reserves for uncertain tax positions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue
Recognition
Revenue is recognized when the following four criteria under ASC 605 have been met: the product has been shipped and the Company
has no significant remaining obligations; persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable;
and collection is probable. Deductions from sales for promotional programs
 manufacturers&rsquo; charge-backs
 co-operative advertising
programs and other programs are recorded as reductions of revenues and are provided for at the time of initial sale of product.
Freight charged to customers is included in revenues
 and has generally been insignificant.

Concentration
of Credit/Sales Risk
primarily of cash and unsecured trade receivables. During the year
 the Company&rsquo;s cash balance at its financial institution
exceeded the FDIC limit of $250.

The
Company performs ongoing evaluations of its customers&rsquo; financial condition and does not require collateral. Management feels
that credit risk beyond the established allowances at January 2
 2016 is limited.

During
the fiscal years ended December 31
 2016 and January 2
 2016
 the Company derived approximately 85% and 83% of its net sales domestically.
The remaining sales in both periods were exports to foreign countries. The accounts receivable balance of one customer represented
approximately 5% of total accounts receivable at December 31
 2016
 and one customer represented 9% of total accounts receivable
at January 2
 2016. In addition
 a significant portion of the Company&rsquo;s sales are to several key distributors
 which are
large distribution companies with numerous divisions and subsidiaries who act independently. Such distributors as a group accounted
for 46% and 44% of the Company&rsquo;s net sales for the fiscal years ended December 31
 2016 and January 2
 2016.

Accounts
Receivable - 
and retailers. Credit is extended based on evaluation of a customers&rsquo; financial condition and
 generally
 collateral is
not required. Accounts receivable are most often due within 30 to 90 days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of
an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due. The
Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors
 including the length of time trade accounts receivable are
past due
 the Company&rsquo;s previous loss history
 the customer&rsquo;s current ability to pay its obligation to the Company
and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company writes-off accounts receivable when they become
uncollectible
 and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the bad debt expense. The Company does not
accrue interest on accounts receivable past due.

Deferred
Revenue and Deferred Costs
billed and shipped
 but for which the transactions have not met its revenue recognition criteria. The cost of the related product
has been recorded as deferred costs on its balance sheet.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents
to be cash equivalents.

Inventories

future demand are written down and charged to the provision for inventories. At the point of which loss is recognized
 a new
lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration
or increase in the newly established cost basis.

The
Company purchased approximately 33% and 29% of its finished products from one supplier and 22% and 24% of its finished products
from another supplier during the periods ended December 31
 2016 and January 2
 2016
 respectively.

Income
Taxes
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded if there is uncertainty
as to the realization of deferred tax assets. The Company will recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain
tax position only if management&rsquo;s assessment is that the position is &ldquo;more likely than not&rdquo; (i.e.
 a likelihood
greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term
&ldquo;tax position&rdquo; refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future
tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes.

Stock-based
compensation 
ASC 718
 &ldquo;Compensation &ndash; Stock Compensation&rdquo;. Under ASC 718
 share-based awards are valued at fair value on
the date of grant and that fair value is recognized over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis. The Company values
its stock option using the Black- Scholes option pricing model.

Net
Income (Loss) Per Share 
of common shares outstanding. For the fiscal year ended December 31
 2016
 stock equivalents of 80
000 shares were excluded from
diluted earnings per share calculations since the effect was anti-dilutive because the strike price was greater than the quoted
market value at such date. For the fiscal year ended January 2
 2016
 stock equivalents of 80
000 shares were excluded from diluted
earnings per share calculations since the effect was anti-dilutive due to overall net loss position.

 accounts payable and accrued expenses are stated at their carrying values. The carrying amounts approximate

Advertising
Costs
the fiscal years ended December 31

Product
Costs of new product development and product redesign are charged to expense as incurred. Product
development costs amounted to $426 and $523 during the fiscal years ended December 31
 2016 and January 2
 2016
 respectively.

Recent
&#9;In June 2016
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
or ASU 2016-13
 Financial Instruments (Topic 326)- Credit Losses
 Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
 which
provides guidance regarding the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. The new guidance replaces the incurred
loss impairment methodology in the current guidance with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration
of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to determine credit loss estimates. This ASU will be effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018.
The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this guidance on its financial statements. 

In
March 2016
2016-09
 Stock Compensation
 which simplifies several aspects
of the accounting for share-based payment transactions
 including the income tax consequences
 classification of awards as either
equity or liabilities
 and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning
after December 15
 2016
 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
this guidance on its financial statements.

In
February 2016
 the FASB issued guidance which amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting
 including requiring
lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. This guidance will
be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption
is permitted. The new leases standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at
 or entered
into after
 the date of initial application
 with an option to use certain transition relief. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of adopting the new leases standard on its financial statements.

In
November 2015
 the FASB issued guidance that eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities
and assets as current and non-current in a classified balance sheet. 
organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The amendments apply to all
organizations that present a classified balance sheet. This amendment is effective for the Company for financial statements issued
for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company has not yet
adopted this guidance but does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its financial statements
and related disclosures.

In
July 2015
 the FASB issued guidance which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to
the lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 defines net realizable value as estimated selling pricings in the ordinary
course of business
 less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal
 and transportation. The new guidance must be applied
on a prospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods within those
fiscal years
 with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact
on its financial statements and related disclosures.

In
2015
 the FASB issued an accounting standards update which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one
year. The update applies to all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services and is effective
for public companies for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2017. Early application is permitted
only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim reporting periods within that reporting
period. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of this update and has not yet determined its impact on its financial
statements.

In
August
 2014
 the FASB issued guidance that requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise
doubt about an entity&rsquo;s
conditions or events exist
 disclosures are
required that enable users of the financial statements to understand the nature of the conditions or events
 management&rsquo;s
evaluation of the circumstances and management&rsquo;s plans to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt
about the entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will be required to perform an annual assessment
of its ability to continue as a going concern as this standard became effective for it for annual periods ending after December
15
 2016 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15
 2016. The adoption of this guidance is not expected
to impact the Company&rsquo;s financial position
 results of operations or cash flows.

NOTE
5: STOCK OPTIONS 

On
June 10
 2014
 the shareholders of the Company approved the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the &ldquo;2014 Plan&rdquo;). The 2014
Plan provides for grants of various types of awards that are designed to attract and retain highly qualified personnel who will
contribute to the success of the Company and to provide incentives to participants in the 2014 Plan that are linked directly to
increases in shareholder value which will therefore inure to the benefit of all shareholders of the Company. The Company intends
to rely on a combination of multi-year performance awards
 options and other stock-based awards for these purposes. The 2014 Plan
made 250
000 shares of Common Stock available for awards. The 2014 Plan also permits performance-based 2014 awards paid under
it to be tax deductible under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended
 as &ldquo;performance-based compensation.&rdquo;
As of December 31
 2016
 the Company has issued 80
000 non-qualified stock option awards under the 2014 Plan.

NOTE
6: LEASES 

The
Company&rsquo;s facilities are located in a one-story facility in Cranford
 New Jersey. The 6
200 square foot facility houses
its administrative offices
 a warehouse
 walk-in freezer and refrigerator
 and a product development laboratory and test kitchen.
The Company&rsquo;s original lease agreement expired on July 1
 1999
 but it continues to occupy the premises on a monthly basis.
Any changes by either the landlord or the Company remains subject to a six month notification period. The Company currently has
no plans to enter into a long-term lease agreement for the facility. Rent expense was $81 in fiscal 2016 and $82 in fiscal 2015.
The Company&rsquo;s management believes that the Cranford facility will continue to satisfy its space requirements for the foreseeable

At
December 31
 2016
 the Company has $1
254 of federal net operating loss carryforwards and $2
058 of state net operating loss carryforwards
which will begin to expire in 2032.

Management
has concluded that based upon all available evidence it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be utilized.
The Company has recorded a decrease in the federal and state valuation allowances in the amount of $187 during the year ended
December 31
 2016. The remaining deferred tax asset is offset by the federal unrecorded tax benefit.

The
Company will recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management&rsquo;s assessment
is that the position is &ldquo;more likely than not&rdquo; (i.e.
 a likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax
jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term &ldquo;tax position&rdquo; refers to a position in
a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current
or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes.

The
following table indicates the changes to the Company&rsquo;s uncertain tax positions for the fiscal years ended December 31
 2016
and January 2
 2016:

The
Company accounts for penalties or interest related to uncertain tax positions as part of its provision for income taxes. The Company
had approximately $2 and $2 of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions at December 31
 2016 and January
2
 2016
 respectively. The amount of uncertain tax positions that would affect the effective tax rate if they were recognized
is $136.
The
liability at December 31
 2016 for uncertain tax positions is included in accrued expenses. The Company&rsquo;s federal and state
tax returns are open to examination for the years 2013 to 2016.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
 2016
 our company&rsquo;s chief executive officer and chief financial
officer conducted an evaluation regarding the effectiveness of our company&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon the evaluation of these controls and procedures
 our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective with respect

 as


Disclosure
Controls and Internal Controls.
Act of 1934
 as amended
 Disclosure Controls are defined as meaning controls and procedures that are designed with the objective
of insuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended
(the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;)
 is recorded
 processed
 designed and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC&rsquo;s
rules and forms. Disclosure Controls include
 within the definition under the Exchange Act
 and without limitation
 controls and
procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports is accumulated and communicated to our management
including our chief executive officer and principal financial officer
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.
Internal Controls are procedures which are designed with the objective of providing reasonable assurance that (1) our transactions
are properly authorized; (2) our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use; and (3) our transactions are properly
recorded and reported
 all to permit the preparation of our financial statements inconformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

Management&rsquo;s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed by


 management and other personnel
 to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because
of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management&rsquo;s
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting includes using the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission
 or COSO
 framework
 an integrated framework (2013) for the evaluation of internal controls issued by COSO
 to identify
the risks and control objectives related to the evaluation of our control environment.


    
    


Based
on their evaluation under the frameworks described above
 our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31
 2016 because of the following material weaknesses
in internal controls over financial reporting:



    
    
A
    continuing lack of sufficient resources and an insufficient level of monitoring and oversight
 which may restrict our ability
    to gather
 analyze and report information relative to the financial statements in a timely manner.

    
    
    

    
    
The
    limited size of the accounting department makes it impracticable to achieve an optimum separation of duties.




We
are continuing to seek ways to remediate these weaknesses
 which stem from our small workforce
 that will not require us to hire
additional personnel.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

No
change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended December 31
 2016 that materially affected
or is reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

 New Jersey. The 6
200 square foot facility houses its administrative offices
 a warehouse
&#13;walk-in freezer and refrigerator
 and a product development laboratory and test kitchen. The Company&amp;#8217;s original lease agreement&#13;expired on July 1
 1999
 but it continues to occupy the premises on a monthly basis. Any changes by either the landlord or the&#13;Company remains subject to a six month notification period. The Company currently has no plans to enter into a long-term lease&#13;agreement for the facility. Rent expense was $81 in fiscal 2016 and $82 in fiscal 2015. The Company&amp;#8217;s management believes&#13;that the Cranford facility will continue to satisfy its space requirements for the foreseeable future and that if necessary

 such as unforeseen cost and expenses

&#13;increased competition
 and other factors beyond the Company&amp;#8217;s control. Management cannot provide assurance that the Company&#13;will operate profitably in the future
 or that it will not require significant additional financing in order to accomplish or exceed&#13;the objectives of its business plan. Consequently
 the Company&amp;#8217;s historical operating results cannot be relied on to be an&#13;indicator of future performance

 the development

 its&#13;goal is to focus on non-dairy foods. The Company&amp;#8217;s chief operating decision maker tracks revenue by product groups
 but does&#13;not track more granular operating results by product group as many of the ingredients are similar amongst these groups. As a result
&#13;the Company has determined that it has only one operating segment
 which is the development
 production and marketing of soy-based

 the Company derived approximately 85% and 83% of its net sales domestically. The remaining sales&#13;in both periods were exports to foreign countries. The accounts receivable balance of one customer represented approximately 5%&#13;of total accounts receivable at December 31
 2016
 and one customer represented 9% of total accounts receivable at January 2
 2016.&#13;In addition
 a significant portion of the Company&amp;#8217;s sales are to several key distributors
 which are large distribution companies&#13;with numerous divisions and subsidiaries who act independently. Such distributors as a group accounted for 46% and 44% of the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;net sales for the fiscal years ended December 31
 2016 and January 2

 generally
 collateral is not required. Accounts receivable are&#13;most often due within 30 to 90 days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts&#13;outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due. The Company determines its allowance by considering&#13;a number of factors
 including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due
 the Company&amp;#8217;s previous loss history
&#13;the customer&amp;#8217;s current ability to pay its obligation to the Company
 and the condition of the general economy and the industry&#13;as a whole. The Company writes-off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible

 2016

 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
 or ASU 2016-13
 Financial Instruments (Topic 326)- Credit&#13;Losses
 Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
 which provides guidance regarding the measurement of credit losses&#13;on financial instruments. The new guidance replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in the current guidance with a methodology&#13;that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to&#13;determine credit loss estimates. This ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 with early adoption&#13;permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15

 the FASB issued ASU 2016-09
&#13;Stock Compensation
 which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions
 including the income&#13;tax consequences
 classification of awards as either equity or liabilities
 and classification on the statement of cash flows.&#13;The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2016

 the FASB issued guidance&#13;which amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting
 including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their&#13;balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. This guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after&#13;December 15
 2018 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The new leases standard requires&#13;a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the date of initial application

 the FASB issued guidance&#13;that eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and non-current&#13;in a classified balance sheet. Instead
 organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent.&#13;The amendments apply to all organizations that present a classified balance sheet. This amendment is effective for the Company&#13;for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15

 the FASB issued guidance&#13;which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable&#13;value. ASU 2015-11 defines net realizable value as estimated selling pricings in the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably&#13;predictable costs of completion
 disposal
 and transportation. The new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis and is effective&#13;for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods within those fiscal years

 the FASB issued an accounting&#13;standards update which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. The update applies to all companies&#13;that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services and is effective for public companies for interim and annual&#13;reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2017. Early application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning&#13;after December 15
 2016

 2014
&#13;the FASB issued guidance that requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt&#13;about an entity&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. If such conditions or events exist
 disclosures are required that&#13;enable users of the financial statements to understand the nature of the conditions or events
 management&amp;#8217;s evaluation of&#13;the circumstances and management&amp;#8217;s plans to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity&amp;#8217;s&#13;ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will be required to perform an annual assessment of its ability to continue&#13;as a going concern as this standard became effective for it for annual periods ending after December 15
 2016 and interim periods&#13;within annual periods beginning after December 15
 2016. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to impact the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;financial position

 2014
 the shareholders of the Company&#13;approved the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the &amp;#8220;2014 Plan&amp;#8221;). The 2014 Plan provides for grants of various types of awards&#13;that are designed to attract and retain highly qualified personnel who will contribute to the success of the Company and to provide&#13;incentives to participants in the 2014 Plan that are linked directly to increases in shareholder value which will therefore inure&#13;to the benefit of all shareholders of the Company. The Company intends to rely on a combination of multi-year performance awards
&#13;options and other stock-based awards for these purposes. The 2014 Plan made 250
000 shares of Common Stock available for awards.&#13;The 2014 Plan also permits performance-based 2014 awards paid under it to be tax deductible under Section 162(m) of the Internal&#13;Revenue Code of 1986

 its&#13;goal is to focus on non-dairy foods. The Company&amp;#8217;s chief operating decision maker tracks revenue by product groups
 but&#13;does not track more granular operating results by product group as many of the ingredients are similar amongst these groups. As&#13;a result
 the Company has determined that it has only one operating segment
 which is the development
 production and marketing&#13;of soy-based
 non-dairy frozen desserts

 the Company derived approximately 85% and 83% of its net sales domestically. The remaining sales&#13;in both periods were exports to foreign countries. The accounts receivable balance of one customer represented approximately 5%&#13;of total accounts receivable at December 31
 2016
 and one customer represented 9% of total accounts receivable at January 2
&#13;2016. In addition
 a significant portion of the Company&amp;#8217;s sales are to several key distributors
 which are large distribution&#13;companies with numerous divisions and subsidiaries who act independently. Such distributors as a group accounted for 46% and 44%&#13;of the Company&amp;#8217;s net sales for the fiscal years ended December 31
 2016 and January 2


 generally
 collateral is not required. Accounts receivable&#13;are most often due within 30 to 90 days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts.&#13;Accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due. The Company determines its allowance by&#13;considering a number of factors
 including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due
 the Company&amp;#8217;s previous&#13;loss history
 the customer&amp;#8217;s current ability to pay its obligation to the Company
 and the condition of the general economy&#13;and the industry as a whole. The Company writes-off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible

 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
 or ASU 2016-13
 Financial Instruments (Topic 326)- Credit&#13;Losses
 Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
 which provides guidance regarding the measurement of credit losses&#13;on financial instruments. The new guidance replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in the current guidance with a methodology&#13;that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to&#13;determine credit loss estimates. This ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 with early adoption&#13;permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15

 the FASB issued ASU 2016-09
&#13;Stock Compensation
 which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions
 including the income&#13;tax consequences
 classification of awards as either equity or liabilities
 and classification on the statement of cash flows.&#13;The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2016

 the FASB issued guidance&#13;which amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting
 including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their&#13;balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. This guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after&#13;December 15
 2018 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The new leases standard requires&#13;a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the date of initial application

 the FASB issued guidance&#13;that eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and non-current&#13;in a classified balance sheet. Instead
 organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent.&#13;The amendments apply to all organizations that present a classified balance sheet. This amendment is effective for the Company&#13;for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15

 the FASB issued guidance&#13;which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable&#13;value. ASU 2015-11 defines net realizable value as estimated selling pricings in the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably&#13;predictable costs of completion
 disposal
 and transportation. The new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis and is effective&#13;for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods within those fiscal years

 the FASB issued an accounting&#13;standards update which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. The update applies to all companies&#13;that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services and is effective for public companies for interim and annual&#13;reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2017. Early application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning&#13;after December 15
 2016

 2014
&#13;the FASB issued guidance that requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt&#13;about an entity&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. If such conditions or events exist
 disclosures are required that&#13;enable users of the financial statements to understand the nature of the conditions or events
 management&amp;#8217;s evaluation of&#13;the circumstances and management&amp;#8217;s plans to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity&amp;#8217;s&#13;ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will be required to perform an annual assessment of its ability to continue&#13;as a going concern as this standard became effective for it for annual periods ending after December 15
 2016 and interim periods&#13;within annual periods beginning after December 15

NOTE 2: DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS
AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

 - Tofutti
Brands Inc. (&#8220;Tofutti&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is engaged in one business segment
 the development
 production
and marketing of non-dairy frozen desserts and other food products.

The Company
reports on operating segments in accordance with standards for public companies to report information about operating segments
and geographic distribution of sales in financial statements. While the Company has multiple products and or product groups
 its
goal is to focus on non-dairy foods. The Company&#8217;s chief operating decision maker tracks revenue by product groups
 but does
not track more granular operating results by product group as many of the ingredients are similar amongst these groups. As a result
the Company has determined that it has only one operating segment
 which is the development
 production and marketing of soy-based
non-dairy frozen desserts
 frozen food products and soy-based cheese products.

 - The Company operates
on a fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to December 31st. Fiscal years for the financial statements included herein are
the fifty-two week fiscal period ended on December 31
 2016 and the fifty-three week period fiscal ended January 2
 2016.

 -
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Significant estimates include allowance for doubtful accounts
 sales promotion accruals
 inventory
reserves and reserves for uncertain tax positions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 - Revenue
is recognized when goods are shipped from production facilities or outside warehouses to customers. Revenue is recognized when
the following four criteria under ASC 605 have been met: the product has been shipped and the Company has no significant remaining
obligations; persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collection is probable.
Deductions from sales for promotional programs
 manufacturers&#8217; charge-backs
 co-operative advertising programs and other
programs are recorded as reductions of revenues and are provided for at the time of initial sale of product. Freight charged to
customers is included in revenues
 and has generally been insignificant.


- Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and unsecured
trade receivables. During the year
 the Company&#8217;s cash balance at its financial institution exceeded the FDIC limit of $250.


financial condition and does not require collateral. Management feels that credit risk beyond the established allowances at January
2
 2016 is limited.


31
 2016 and January 2
 2016
 the Company derived approximately 85% and 83% of its net sales domestically. The remaining sales
in both periods were exports to foreign countries. The accounts receivable balance of one customer represented approximately 5%
of total accounts receivable at December 31
 2016
 and one customer represented 9% of total accounts receivable at January 2
 2016.
In addition
 a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s sales are to several key distributors
 which are large distribution companies
with numerous divisions and subsidiaries who act independently. Such distributors as a group accounted for 46% and 44% of the Company&#8217;s
net sales for the fiscal years ended December 31
 2016 and January 2
 2016.

The majority
of the Company&#8217;s accounts receivables are due from distributors (domestic and international) and retailers. Credit is extended
based on evaluation of a customers&#8217; financial condition and
 generally
 collateral is not required. Accounts receivable are
most often due within 30 to 90 days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts
outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due. The Company determines its allowance by considering
a number of factors
 including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due
 the Company&#8217;s previous loss history
the customer&#8217;s current ability to pay its obligation to the Company
 and the condition of the general economy and the industry
as a whole. The Company writes-off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible
 and payments subsequently received on such
receivables are credited to the bad debt expense. The Company does not accrue interest on accounts receivable past due.


- Deferred revenue represents amounts from sales of the Company&#8217;s product that have been billed and shipped
 but for which
the transactions have not met its revenue recognition criteria. The cost of the related product has been recorded as deferred costs
on its balance sheet.

 - The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

- Inventory is stated
at lower of cost or market determined by first in first out (FIFO) method. Inventories in excess of future demand are written down
and charged to the provision for inventories. At the point of which loss is recognized
 a new
 lower cost basis for that inventory
is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in the newly established
cost basis.


33% and 29% of its finished products from one supplier and 22% and 24% of its finished products from another supplier during the
periods ended December 31
 2016 and January 2
 2016
 respectively.

 - Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded if there is uncertainty as to the realization of deferred tax assets.
The Company will recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management&#8217;s assessment
is that the position is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; (i.e.
 a likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax
jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term &#8220;tax position&#8221; refers to a position in
a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current
or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes.

- The
Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees and directors in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718
 &#8220;Compensation
&#8211; Stock Compensation&#8221;. Under ASC 718
 share-based awards are valued at fair value on the date of grant and that fair
value is recognized over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis. The Company values its stock option using the Black-
Scholes option pricing model.

-
Basic earnings per common share has been computed by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
For the fiscal year ended December 31
 2016
 stock equivalents of 80
000 shares were excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations
since the effect was anti-dilutive because the strike price was greater than the quoted market value at such date. For the fiscal
year ended January 2
 2016
 stock equivalents of 80
000 shares were excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations since
the effect was anti-dilutive due to overall net loss position.

- The fair value of financial instruments
 which primarily consist of cash and equivalents
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable
and accrued expenses are stated at their carrying values. The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short-term
nature of those instruments.

- Freight costs
to ship inventory to customers and to outside warehouses amounted to $943 and $857 during the fiscal years ended December 31
 2016
and January 2
 2016
 respectively. Such costs are included in costs of goods sold.

 - The Company
expenses advertising costs as they are incurred. Advertising expenses amounted to $158 and $236 during the fiscal years ended December
31
 2016 and January 2
 2016
 respectively.

Costs
of new product development and product redesign are charged to expense as incurred. Product development costs amounted to $426
and $523 during the fiscal years ended December 31
 2016 and January 2
 2016
 respectively.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
&#8211; 
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
 or ASU 2016-13
 Financial Instruments (Topic 326)- Credit
Losses
 Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
 which provides guidance regarding the measurement of credit losses
on financial instruments. The new guidance replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in the current guidance with a methodology
that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to
determine credit loss estimates. This ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 with early adoption
permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this guidance
on its financial statements.


 the FASB issued ASU 2016-09
Stock Compensation
 which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions
 including the income
tax consequences
 classification of awards as either equity or liabilities
 and classification on the statement of cash flows.
The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 and interim periods within those annual periods.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its financial statements.


 the FASB issued guidance
which amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting
 including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their
balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. This guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15
 2018 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The new leases standard requires
a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the date of initial application
with an option to use certain transition relief. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new leases standard
on its financial statements.


 the FASB issued guidance
that eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and non-current
in a classified balance sheet. Instead
 organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent.
The amendments apply to all organizations that present a classified balance sheet. This amendment is effective for the Company
for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods.
The Company has not yet adopted this guidance but does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on
its financial statements and related disclosures.


 the FASB issued guidance
which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable
value. ASU 2015-11 defines net realizable value as estimated selling pricings in the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably
predictable costs of completion
 disposal
 and transportation. The new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis and is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods within those fiscal years
 with early adoption permitted.
The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its financial statements and related disclosures.


 the FASB issued an accounting
standards update which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. The update applies to all companies
that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services and is effective for public companies for interim and annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2017. Early application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15
 2016
 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating
the requirements of this update and has not yet determined its impact on its financial statements.


 2014
the FASB issued guidance that requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt
about an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. If such conditions or events exist
 disclosures are required that
enable users of the financial statements to understand the nature of the conditions or events
 management&#8217;s evaluation of
the circumstances and management&#8217;s plans to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity&#8217;s
ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will be required to perform an annual assessment of its ability to continue
as a going concern as this standard became effective for it for annual periods ending after December 15
 2016 and interim periods
within annual periods beginning after December 15
 2016. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to impact the Company&#8217;s
financial position
 results of operations or cash flows.

Disclosure of Compensation Related Costs
 Share-based Payments [Abstract]









 2014
 the shareholders of the Company
approved the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the &#8220;2014 Plan&#8221;). The 2014 Plan provides for grants of various types of awards
that are designed to attract and retain highly qualified personnel who will contribute to the success of the Company and to provide
incentives to participants in the 2014 Plan that are linked directly to increases in shareholder value which will therefore inure
to the benefit of all shareholders of the Company. The Company intends to rely on a combination of multi-year performance awards
options and other stock-based awards for these purposes. The 2014 Plan made 250
000 shares of Common Stock available for awards.
The 2014 Plan also permits performance-based 2014 awards paid under it to be tax deductible under Section 162(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended
 as &#8220;performance-based compensation.&#8221; As of December 31

 - Tofutti
Brands Inc. (&#8220;Tofutti&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is engaged in one business segment
 the development
 production
and marketing of non-dairy frozen desserts and other food products.






The Company
reports on operating segments in accordance with standards for public companies to report information about operating segments
and geographic distribution of sales in financial statements. While the Company has multiple products and or product groups
 its
goal is to focus on non-dairy foods. The Company&#8217;s chief operating decision maker tracks revenue by product groups
 but
does not track more granular operating results by product group as many of the ingredients are similar amongst these groups. As
a result
 the Company has determined that it has only one operating segment
 which is the development
 production and marketing
of soy-based
 non-dairy frozen desserts
 frozen food products and soy-based cheese products.






 - The Company operates
on a fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to December 31st. Fiscal years for the financial statements included herein are
the fifty-two week fiscal period ended on December 31
 2016 and the fifty-three week period fiscal ended January 2
 2016.







- The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include allowance for doubtful accounts
 sales promotion accruals
inventory reserves and reserves for uncertain tax positions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.






 - Revenue
is recognized when goods are shipped from production facilities or outside warehouses to customers. Revenue is recognized when
the following four criteria under ASC 605 have been met: the product has been shipped and the Company has no significant remaining
obligations; persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collection is
probable. Deductions from sales for promotional programs
 manufacturers&#8217; charge-backs
 co-operative advertising programs
and other programs are recorded as reductions of revenues and are provided for at the time of initial sale of product. Freight
charged to customers is included in revenues
 and has generally been insignificant.







- Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and unsecured
trade receivables. During the year
 the Company&#8217;s cash balance at its financial institution exceeded the FDIC limit of $250.


financial condition and does not require collateral. Management feels that credit risk beyond the established allowances at January
2
 2016 is limited.


31
 2016 and January 2
 2016
 the Company derived approximately 85% and 83% of its net sales domestically. The remaining sales
in both periods were exports to foreign countries. The accounts receivable balance of one customer represented approximately 5%
of total accounts receivable at December 31
 2016
 and one customer represented 9% of total accounts receivable at January 2
2016. In addition
 a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s sales are to several key distributors
 which are large distribution
companies with numerous divisions and subsidiaries who act independently. Such distributors as a group accounted for 46% and 44%
of the Company&#8217;s net sales for the fiscal years ended December 31
 2016 and January 2
 2016.






The majority
of the Company&#8217;s accounts receivables are due from distributors (domestic and international) and retailers. Credit is extended
based on evaluation of a customers&#8217; financial condition and
 generally
 collateral is not required. Accounts receivable
are most often due within 30 to 90 days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts.
Accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due. The Company determines its allowance by
considering a number of factors
 including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due
 the Company&#8217;s previous
loss history
 the customer&#8217;s current ability to pay its obligation to the Company
 and the condition of the general economy
and the industry as a whole. The Company writes-off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible
 and payments subsequently
received on such receivables are credited to the bad debt expense. The Company does not accrue interest on accounts receivable
past due.






Deferred Revenue and Deferred Costs

 but for
which the transactions have not met its revenue recognition criteria. The cost of the related product has been recorded as deferred
costs on its balance sheet.






 -
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.






- Inventory is stated
at lower of cost or market determined by first in first out (FIFO) method. Inventories in excess of future demand are written down
and charged to the provision for inventories. At the point of which loss is recognized
 a new
 lower cost basis for that inventory
is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in the newly established
cost basis.


33% and 29% of its finished products from one supplier and 22% and 24% of its finished products from another supplier during the
periods ended December 31
 2016 and January 2
 2016
 respectively.






 - Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded if there is uncertainty as to the realization of
deferred tax assets. The Company will recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if
management&#8217;s assessment is that the position is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; (i.e.
 a likelihood greater than 50 percent)
to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term &#8220;tax position&#8221;
refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected
in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes.






- The
Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees and directors in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718
 &#8220;Compensation
&#8211; Stock Compensation&#8221;. Under ASC 718
 share-based awards are valued at fair value on the date of grant and that fair
value is recognized over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis. The Company values its stock option using the
Black- Scholes option pricing model.






-
Basic earnings per common share has been computed by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
For the fiscal year ended December 31
 2016
 stock equivalents of 80
000 shares were excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations
since the effect was anti-dilutive because the strike price was greater than the quoted market value at such date. For the fiscal
year ended January 2
 2016
 stock equivalents of 80
000 shares were excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations since
the effect was anti-dilutive due to overall net loss position.

- Freight costs
to ship inventory to customers and to outside warehouses amounted to $943 and $857 during the fiscal years ended December 31
2016 and January 2
 2016
 respectively. Such costs are included in costs of goods sold.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
&#8211; 
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
 or ASU 2016-13
 Financial Instruments (Topic 326)- Credit
Losses
 Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
 which provides guidance regarding the measurement of credit losses
on financial instruments. The new guidance replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in the current guidance with a methodology
that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to
determine credit loss estimates. This ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 with early adoption
permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this guidance
on its financial statements.


 the FASB issued ASU 2016-09
Stock Compensation
 which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions
 including the income
tax consequences
 classification of awards as either equity or liabilities
 and classification on the statement of cash flows.
The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 and interim periods within those annual periods.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its financial statements.


 the FASB issued guidance
which amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting
 including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their
balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. This guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15
 2018 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The new leases standard requires
a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the date of initial application
with an option to use certain transition relief. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new leases standard
on its financial statements.


 the FASB issued guidance
that eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and non-current
in a classified balance sheet. Instead
 organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent.
The amendments apply to all organizations that present a classified balance sheet. This amendment is effective for the Company
for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods.
The Company has not yet adopted this guidance but does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on
its financial statements and related disclosures.


 the FASB issued guidance
which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable
value. ASU 2015-11 defines net realizable value as estimated selling pricings in the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably
predictable costs of completion
 disposal
 and transportation. The new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis and is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods within those fiscal years
 with early adoption permitted.
The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its financial statements and related disclosures.


 the FASB issued an accounting
standards update which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. The update applies to all companies
that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services and is effective for public companies for interim and annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2017. Early application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15
 2016
 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating
the requirements of this update and has not yet determined its impact on its financial statements.


 2014
the FASB issued guidance that requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt
about an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. If such conditions or events exist
 disclosures are required that
enable users of the financial statements to understand the nature of the conditions or events
 management&#8217;s evaluation of
the circumstances and management&#8217;s plans to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity&#8217;s
ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will be required to perform an annual assessment of its ability to continue
as a going concern as this standard became effective for it for annual periods ending after December 15
 2016 and interim periods
within annual periods beginning after December 15
 2016. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to impact the Company&#8217;s
financial position
 results of operations or cash flows.
