This annual report on Form 10-K is being filed by our company following the completion of our acquisition of substantially all of the assets
 property and undertaking of the health beverage and food business operated under the name &#8220;KonaRed&#8221; (the &#8220;Business&#8221;) from Sandwich Isles Trading Co. Inc. (&#8220;Sandwich Isles&#8221;)
 a private Hawaiian corporation
 on October 4
 2013
 pursuant to the terms of an asset purchase agreement dated October 4
 2013 (the Asset Agreement). As a result of our acquisition of the Business from Sandwich Isles
 we ceased to be a &#8220;shell company&#8221; as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the 


In connection with the closing of the Asset Agreement with Sandwich Isles
 we experienced a change of control
 as our existing director resigned
 new directors who were nominees of Sandwich Isles were appointed to our board and Sandwich Isles was issued shares that constituted 59.07% of our issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. Additionally
 as a result of the acquisition
 Sandwich Isles&#8217; current management became our management. As a result
 we have determined to treat the acquisition as a reverse recapitalization for accounting purposes
 with Sandwich Isles as the acquirer for accounting purposes. As such
 the financial information
 including the operating and financial results
 audited financial statements
 included in this annual report on Form 10-K are primarily that of Sandwich Isles
 rather than that of our predecessor company TeamUpSport Inc. prior to the completion of the Asset Agreement.
