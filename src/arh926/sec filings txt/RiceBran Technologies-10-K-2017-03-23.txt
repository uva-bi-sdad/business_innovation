 a fiber rich derivative of SRB; RiBalance
 a complete rice bran nutritional package derived from further processing SRB
 and our ProRyza family of products including
 protein- and protein/fiber-based products.&#160; &#8220;Stage II&#8221; refers to the products produced using our patented process technology run at our Dillon




 we formulate
 blend and package finished products on a customized basis for our customers.&#160; We also lease a facility in West Sacramento
 California that houses a laboratory
 warehouse and facility for assembling RBT proprietary extruders for stabilizing raw rice bran.&#160; In 2016







 whose only operating subsidiary is Irgovel
 located in Pelotas
 Brazil.&#160; Irgovel manufactures RBO and DRB products for both the food ingredient and animal nutrition markets in Brazil and internationally.&#160; In refining RBO to an edible grade
 several co-products are obtained.&#160; One such product is distilled fatty acids
 a valuable raw material for the detergent industry.&#160; Irgovel also produces rice lecithin
 which has application in food ingredient products
 animal nutrition and industrial applications.&#160; DRB is sold in bulk in the Brazilian market and internationally as an animal nutrition ingredient
 and is sold as a raw material for further processing into food ingredient products.&#160; In 2016




 Brazil.&#160; These facilities include a plant for extraction of RBO from raw rice bran
 RBO refining processes
 compounded animal nutrition manufacturing
 consumer RBO bottling
 distilled fatty acid manufacture
 lecithin manufacture
 and support systems for the plant
 including steam generation
 maintenance







 our greatest opportunities are in the functional food








 nutritional supplement retailers and direct sales companies.&#160; In August 2013
 we entered into a multi-year agreement to sell certain of our Stage II products to a rapidly growing direct marketing company.&#160; Pursuant to that agreement







 DRB
 RBO and derivatives are nutritional
 functional and beneficial food products that contain a unique combination of oil
 protein
 carbohydrates
 vitamins
 minerals
 fibers and antioxidants that enhance the nutritional value of popular consumer products.&#160; Foods that are ideally suited for the addition of our SRB and DRB to their products include processed meats
 cereals
 snacks
 beverages
 baked goods
 breading and batters.&#160; The inclusion of DRB in breading and batters can result in a reduction in oil uptake
 higher moisture retention
 improved nutritional profiles




 we received U. S. Department of Agriculture (&#8220;USDA&#8221;) Food Safety and Inspection Service (&#8220;FSIS&#8221;) approval to market rice bran as an ingredient to be used as a filler in comminuted meat products
 such as meat and poultry sausages that contain binders
 nugget-shaped patties
 meatballs
 meatloaf and meat and poultry patties.&#160; Our products replace functional ingredients like soy protein isolate
 soy protein concentrate
 modified food starch
 pea protein and mustard flour at a significantly reduced cost.&#160; With strong application benefits such as reduced cost per unit
 increased product yield and reduced purge















 and we will continue to pursue high margin sales opportunities in those markets.&#160; SRB and DRB are used as equine feed ingredients and have been shown to provide health benefits.&#160; Show and performance horses represent the premium end of the equine market and are a key target for our animal nutrition products.&#160; In our Brazil segment
 we also sell DRB as an ingredient for inclusion in a variety of feed formulations targeted to animal species such as horses
 beef cattle
 dairy cows
 pigs







 Brazil and the United States rank 9th and 11th
 respectively
 in production of rice




 individual rice kernels are stored in common receiving locations such as farm silos for future delivery to grain dryers or area rice mills.&#160; At this stage
 large quantities of individual rice kernels are collectively called &#8220;paddy rice
&#8221; or &#8220;rough&#8221; rice.&#160; In this form
 the rice kernel is fully enveloped by the rice hull
 which serves as a protective cover




 if necessary
 paddy rice is cleaned of foreign material (scalping
 de-stoning and aspiration) just before it enters the first stage of milling
 or paddy husking.&#160; In the paddy husker
 the hull is removed from rough rice by differential speed rubber rollers.&#160; Loosened hulls are carried off by aspiration.&#160; After husking




 the outer brown layers of bran are removed from the inner white starch endosperm by an abrasive or frictional milling process which produces a milled
 white rice kernel.&#160; After milling
 white rice is typically sorted by size to remove broken pieces of rice kernels from whole kernels




 testa
 nucellus and aleurone) surrounding the white starchy endosperm.&#160; Commercial rice bran makes up approximately 10% of rough rice by weight.&#160; Rice germ
 an especially nutrient rich material




 the oils present in raw rice bran come into contact with native lipase enzymes that are naturally present in the rice kernel.&#160; These lipase enzymes initiate a rapid enzymatic hydrolysis of the oil
 converting oils (triglycerides) into monoglycerides
 diglycerides and free fatty acids (&#8220;FFA&#8221;).&#160; As the FFA content builds in raw rice bran
 the bran becomes unpalatable and off flavors (rancidity) develop.&#160; If left unchecked
 enzymatic degradation at normal room temperatures can increase the FFA levels to 5-8% within 24 hours and can continue at a rate of approximately 4-5% per day thereafter.&#160; Enzymatic degradation is the most serious form of degradation of raw rice bran.&#160; Rice bran stabilization is the process of carefully deactivating native enzymes to prevent the increase of FFA otherwise caused by lipase enzyme activity.&#160; Proper stabilization is critical in the preservation of the nutritional value of the bran




 including the use of chemicals










 pressure and other conditions necessary to thoroughly deactivate enzymes without significantly damaging the structure or nutrient content of raw rice bran.&#160; This means that higher value compounds in bran
 such as oils












 on the premises of or in near proximity to any conventional rice mill so that freshly milled raw rice bran can be quickly delivered to our proprietary stabilizers.&#160; Process logic controllers maintain exact process conditions within the prescribed pressure/temperature regime.&#160; In case of power failure or interruption of the flow of fresh bran into the system








000 pounds of bran per hour and has a capacity of over 7
200 tons per year.&#160; Stabilization production capacity can be doubled
 tripled or further multiplied by installing additional units sharing a common conveyor and stage system
 which we believe can handle the output of the world&#8217;s largest rice mills.&#160; We have also developed and tested a smaller production unit
 with a maximum production capacity of 840 tons per year




 including proteins
 fibers
 lipids and micronutrients such as vitamins
 minerals and phytosterols
 among others.&#160; In these processes SRB or DRB

 edible RBO that has superior flavor and functional properties.&#160; In addition
 the various co-products of crude RBO processing
 distilled fatty acids for example
 are refined and sold as products in their own right.&#160; DRB is finely ground and packaged for use as a versatile food ingredient in many applications.&#160; DRB may also be compounded with other ingredients such as a vegetable proteins
 carbohydrates




 except that the oil has been removed.&#160; This is important for several ingredient applications where SRB&#8217;s oil content could present food formulation challenges.&#160; By removing oil from SRB
 nutritionists have greater options to formulate DRB into breakfast bars
 low-calorie foods
 low-fat baking applications and batter and breading for frying applications.&#160; Additionally
 DRB is ideally suited for downstream enzymatic processing




 RBO becomes high quality cooking oil possessing beneficial high temperature frying characteristics.&#160; RBO has a unique fatty acid content that imparts improved oxidative stability as compared to other vegetable oils such as soy or cottonseed giving it advantages when used in food applications.&#160; The RBO extraction process utilized at our Brazilian facility uses a conventional solvent extraction process to separate oil from raw bran
 resulting in crude RBO available for sale to industrial markets or other processors.&#160; Additional refining processes done in Brazil can involve degumming
 neutralization
 bleaching















 we have been issued fourteen foreign patents covering the subject areas.&#160; We intend to apply for additional patents in the future as new products




 as we develop improvements we intend to periodically review whether we should seek patent protection for them.&#160; We believe that certain unique products
 and their biological effects




 we engaged in a joint research project with DSM Innovation Center
 a subsidiary of Royal DSM N.V.
 to develop methods for extracting and concentrating high quality vegetable protein from rice bran.&#160; Combined spending on research and development related to that project totaled $3.0 million.&#160; In March 2013







 the Company was involved in a proxy contest with LF-RB Management (&#8220;LF-RB&#8221;).&#160; LF-RB believed that Board and management changes were necessary to maximize shareholder value
 which included the implementation of a turnaround and growth plan.&#160; The proxy contest resulted in major changes to the Board
 the appointment of Dr. Robert Smith
 our COO at the time
 as interim CEO
 and the hiring of Michael Goose
 a new products innovator with significant consumer packaged goods experience
 as President of Sales and Marketing.&#160; The new management team
 working closely with the Board
 developed a turnaround and growth plan to improve our financial condition
 expand our markets and business









&#160; We have developed a focused plan that provides clear market targets for driving revenue growth in food and animal nutrition ingredients and reflecting our focus on driving better returns on capital and for shareholders.&#160; The first phase of our strategic initiatives will be the streamlining of our operations through consolidation to better position RiceBran as a reliable world-class supplier of ingredients.&#160; We believe we can obtain significant cost reductions and improved efficiencies by consolidating our operations into fewer locations. We are actively engaged in locating a site in California
 in the heart of rice growing territory where much of our bran supply is obtained.&#160; We are relocating our corporate office to Sacramento on April 1
 2017
 and plan to secure and relocate most of our corporate operations in late 2017.&#160; Apart from being the heart of the rice growing region of California
 the Sacramento Valley offers a number of benefits that will help us become the leader in our field while at the same time being more responsive to our customers and reducing the risk in bran supplies.&#160; These benefits include:&#160; i) proximity to major rice mills that we are in discussions with to secure additional bran; ii) proximity to our existing base of west-coast customers for both food and animal nutrition ingredients; iii) access to world-class scientists and technologies at University of California-Davis in areas of rice agriculture and processing
 food and beverage innovation and animal nutrition.&#160; This agricultural and technology hub in the Sacramento Valley generates and supports a strong and well-prepared workforce that will benefit us as we grow our business.&#160; As we consolidate much of our management
 operations
 warehousing and distribution into a centralized location











 but much of this will be mitigated by significant cost reductions that we have already begun to implement
 better operating leverage of new operations
 improved efficiencies through consolidation of our operations
 as well as capital realized from the divestiture of non-core assets and business activities. We may also explore opportunities for key industry participants to become strategic investors in the business. We will take every step possible to maximize company and investor returns by implementing plans that seek strong corporate returns on our investments.&#160; In Brazil

















&#160; The global and domestic markets are strong and rapidly expanding for minimally processed plant-based ingredients that provide dense and balanced nutrition in addition to evidence-based functionalities while also being free of all major allergens and being non-GMO.&#160; The regulatory requirements to add front-of-label warnings on food items and increasing demand from consumers for foods that list fewer and less processed ingredients is driving food companies to replace standard food ingredients with cleaner ingredients
 such as stabilized rice bran.&#160; We anticipate further incorporation of our food ingredients by major consumer packaged goods food companies as more food companies adopt rice bran as a standard clean label food ingredient. This trend is not limited to food ingredients











 outside independent sales representatives and third party distributors to market our portfolio of products to customers domestically and internationally.&#160; In 2016
 three customers accounted for 62% of USA segment revenues.&#160; In our Brazil segment
 three customers accounted for 32% of segment revenues.&#160; In 2015







 we entered into an exclusive supply and cooperation agreement with a Thailand-based entity (&#8220;Youji&#8221;) granting us the exclusive worldwide
 with certain exclusions
 supply and distribution rights for their organic rice bran.&#160; In addition




 we entered into a series of agreements with various affiliates of Wilmar International Limited (collectively &#8220;Wilmar&#8221;).&#160; In connection therewith
 we sold a 50% membership interest in RBT PRO
 LLC (&#8220;RBT PRO&#8221;) to Wilmar.&#160; RBT PRO granted an exclusive
 royalty free
 perpetual sublicense of the license to use processes for deriving protein from rice bran to Wilmar for use throughout China and to us for use worldwide




 and under the agreements
 we obtained the right to purchase 45% of the capital stock of any entity Wilmar establishes to develop new products relating to rice bran or its derivatives
 as defined in the agreement
 using the intellectual property licensed to Wilmar.&#160; If we decline the right to purchase 45% of the capital stock of any such new entity
 we have the option to purchase 25% of the entity within two years of the entity&#8217;s formation.&#160; The exercise price for this option will equal 25% of the capital investment made in the entity
 plus interest

 and at all levels of government in foreign jurisdictions
 including regulations pertaining to the formulation

 distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies
 primarily the Food &amp; Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;)
 the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) and the USDA.&#160; Our activities are also regulated by various governmental agencies for the states and localities in which our products are manufactured and sold
 as well as by governmental agencies in certain countries outside the United States
 such as Brazil (discussed below)
 in which our products are manufactured and sold.&#160; Among other matters
 regulation by the FDA and FTC is concerned with product safety and claims made with respect to a product&#8217;s ability to provide health-related benefits.&#160; Specifically
 the FDA

 including initiating investigations
 issuing warning letters and cease-and-desist orders
 requiring corrective labeling or advertising
 requiring consumer redress such as requiring that a company offer to repurchase products previously sold
 seeking injunctive relief or product seizures
 imposing civil penalties or commencing criminal prosecution.&#160; In addition
 certain state agencies have similar authority.&#160; These federal and state agencies have in the past used these remedies in regulating participants in the food and food ingredient industries

 or unless the use of the substance is otherwise excluded from the definition of a food additive.&#160; When an additive is proposed for use in a meat
 its safety
 technical function and conditions of use must also be evaluated by the USDA.&#160; Because the USDA retains jurisdiction over meat products and food ingredients intended for use in meats










 Livestock and Food Supply (&#8220;MAPA&#8221;)
 one of the Federal administrative bodies
 is the primary regulator of agricultural products in Brazil
 and its main activity is the management of public policies to encourage agriculture
 the promotion of agribusiness and the regulation and standardization of services related to the sector.&#160; Amongst other activities
 MAPA is responsible for the regulation and control of pharmaceuticals
 biological products and medicated feed additives for animal use.&#160; MAPA is organized into departments
 each one responsible for different sectors of the nation&#8217;s agribusiness.&#160; Amongst these departments
 the Secretary of Agricultural Defense (&#8220;SDA&#8221;) is responsible for implementing the actions of the State which aims at the prevention
 control and eradication of animal diseases and plant pests.&#160; The SDA also contributes to the formulation of the national agricultural policy by planning
 regulating
 coordinating and supervising the activities of agricultural defense throughout the country
 being responsible for the coordination of the Department of Inspection of Livestock Products.&#160; In order to fulfill its mission
 the SDA provides central management and regulatory bodies as well as projections within the states for the implementation and coordination of those activities for which it is responsible.&#160; Furthermore
 ANVISA
 a regulatory agency which operates in all those sectors related to products and services that affect the health of the population
 and with expertise that covers both sanitary regulation and the economic regulation of the market
 contributes to the enforcement of most of the regulations regarding processed food products
 including vegetable oils







 as such
 have developed significant brand recognition in the animal feed and food ingredient product sectors both domestically and internationally.&#160; Together with our decades of application technology know-how and patented processing methods




 Europe and Asia.&#160; We believe that our major nutritional supplement competitors include producers of isolated soy protein
 wheat bran and oat bran















 palm
 canola
 peanut and others in the Brazilian retail market.&#160; In addition
 our exported rice bran oil competes with those same oils from other grains

 including those described below
 which could adversely affect our business
 financial condition
 results of operations














 profitability or positive cash flow
 on either a quarterly or annual basis
 and that profitability
 if achieved
 may not be sustained.&#160; If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability
 we may not be financially viable in the future and may have to curtail
 suspend
 or cease operations
 restructure existing operations to attempt to ensure future viability
 or pursue other alternatives such as re-filing for bankruptcy
 pursuing dissolution and liquidation
 seeking to merge with another company
 selling all or substantially all of our assets or raising additional capital through equity or debt financings.&#160; Because of our recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations




 and losses in the future could cause the trading price of our stock to decline or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition




 we have incurred an accumulated deficit in excess of $260 million.&#160; We may not be able to achieve or maintain profitable operations if achieved.&#160; If our losses continue
 our liquidity may continue to be severely impaired
 our stock price may fall and our shareholders may lose all or a significant portion of their investment.&#160; If we are not able to attain profitability in the near future our financial condition could deteriorate further which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects and result in a significant or complete loss of shareholder investment.&#160; Further
 we may be unable to pay our debt obligations as they become due


















 strengthen our financial position or to make acquisitions.&#160; Our board of directors has the ability
 without seeking shareholder approval
 to issue convertible debt and additional shares of common stock or preferred stock that is convertible into common stock for such consideration as the board of directors may consider sufficient
 which may be at a discount to the market price.&#160; Any sales of additional equity or convertible debt securities would result in dilution of the equity interests of our existing shareholders
 which could be substantial.&#160; Additionally
 if we issue shares of preferred stock or convertible debt to raise funds
 the holders of those securities might be entitled to various preferential rights over the holders of our common stock
 including repayment of their investment
 and possibly additional amounts
 before any payments could be made to holders of our common stock in connection with an acquisition of us.&#160; Such preferred shares
 if authorized
 might be granted rights and preferences that would be senior to
 or otherwise adversely affect
 the rights and the value of our common stock.&#160; Also








 or difficulties encountered in the implementation of such controls
 could harm our operating results
 cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements.&#160; Any such failure could
 in turn
 affect the future ability of our management to certify that internal control over our financial reporting is effective.&#160; Inferior internal control over financial reporting could also subject us to the scrutiny of the SEC and other regulatory bodies which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or shareholder litigation




 if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting
 the disclosure of that fact
 even if quickly remedied
 could reduce the market&#8217;s confidence in our financial statements and harm our share price.&#160; Furthermore
 deficiencies could result in future non-compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.&#160; Such non-compliance could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions







 our anticipated share of this market
 the estimated price and acceptance of our products and other factors.&#160; These assumptions are based on our best estimates; however
 our assessments may not prove to be correct.&#160; Any future success may depend upon factors including changes in the dietary supplement industry
 governmental regulation
 increased levels of competition
 including the entry of additional competitors and increased success by existing competitors
 changes in general economic conditions
 increases in operating costs including costs of rice bran
 production
 supplies

 Arizona to California sometime during the first half of 2017. We expect that some of our executive officers and other key decision makers will relocate to California. We may face significant challenges in relocating our principal executive office to a different state
 including difficulties in retaining and attracting officers
 key personnel and other employees and challenges in maintaining corporate headquarters in a state different from where other employees
 including other executive officers
 corporate support staff and manufacturing facilities
 are located. Employees may be uncertain about their future roles within our organization as a result of the relocation. Management may also be required to devote substantial time to relocating our corporate headquarters and related matters
 which could otherwise be devoted to focusing on ongoing business operations and other initiatives and opportunities. Any such difficulties could have an adverse effect on our business

















 we may review opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies
 such as the acquisition of HN that was completed in 2014
 that would complement our current products
 expand the breadth of our markets or enhance technical capabilities
 or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities.&#160; Such acquisitions involve numerous risks
 including












































































 we have an operation in Brazil which manufactures rice bran oil.&#160; There are risks in operating facilities in foreign countries because
 among other reasons
 we may be unable to attract sufficient qualified personnel
 intellectual property rights may not be enforced as we expect and legal rights may not be available as contemplated.&#160; Should any of these risks occur
 our ability to expand our foreign operations may be materially limited and we may be unable to maximize the output from these facilities and our financial results may decrease from our anticipated levels.&#160; The inherent risks of international operations could materially adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.&#160; The types of risks faced in connection with international operations and sales include





















































































































































 political and other conditions
 and Brazilian government policies or actions in response to these conditions




 taxation
 credit
 tariff and other policies to influence the course of Brazil&#8217;s economy.&#160; For example
 the government&#8217;s actions to control inflation have at times involved setting wage and price controls
 blocking access to bank accounts
 imposing exchange controls and limiting imports into Brazil.&#160; In addition
 periodically there are disruptions related to national transportation strikes
 like those occurring in February 2015
 which may limit Irgovel&#8217;s ability to receive raw rice bran and ship products to customers.&#160; We have no control over
 and cannot predict




 results of operations
 financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected by
 among others














































































































































 Irgovel must meet certain minimum annual processing targets and must achieve EBITDA in the local currency of at least R$4.0 million.&#160;&#160; At the end of 2016
 Irgovel did not meet this covenant but the Investors waived the requirement.&#160; If Irgovel fails to meet these financial requirements
 we could lose management control over Irgovel&#8217;s operations
 and management control would transfer to the Investors.&#160; Any such change in management control would cause us to no longer consolidate Irgovel&#8217;s financial results with our financial results.&#160; Instead








 we are subject to the risk of labor disputes
 strikes
 work stoppages and other labor-relations matters.&#160; Our collective bargaining agreement in Brazil has a one-year term and requires that we provide wage adjustments each year.&#160; We may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on similar or more favorable terms and may experience work stoppages or other labor problems in the future.&#160; We could experience a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs
 which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition
 potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers









 pay expenses
 own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. Dollar
 including primarily the Brazilian Real.&#160; Currently
 a significant portion of our revenues and expenses occur in our Brazilian subsidiary
 Irgovel.&#160; Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars
 we must translate revenues and expenses
 as well as assets and liabilities
 into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect historically
 during or at the end of each reporting period.&#160; Therefore
 increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the Brazilian Real and any other currency which affects a material amount of our operations
 will affect our revenues
 cost of sales
 gross profit (loss)
 operating expenses
 or other income and expenses and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies.&#160; These fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.&#160; Disruptions in financial markets may result in significant changes in foreign exchange rates in relatively short periods of time which further increases the risk of an adverse currency effect.&#160; We do not hedge our currency risk

 viability and financial stability of our customers.&#160; We expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenues.&#160; Consolidation among our customers may further reduce the number of customers that generate a significant percentage of our revenues.&#160; This results in a concentration of credit risk with respect to our outstanding accounts receivable.&#160; We consider the financial strength of the customer
 the remoteness of the possible risk that a default event will occur
 the potential benefits to our future growth and development
 possible actions to reduce the likelihood of a default event and the benefits from the transaction before entering into a large credit limit for a customer.&#160; Although we analyze these factors
 the ultimate collection of the obligation from the customer may not occur.&#160; Although we continue to expand our customer base in an attempt to mitigate the concentration of credit risk
 the writing off of an accounts receivable balance could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.&#160; Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables.&#160; Historically
 we have not experienced any loss of our cash and cash equivalents

















 our objective is to protect our profitability

 management believes it has plans in place that will mitigate these historical conditions.&#160; Specifically
 we completed an $8 million debt and equity raise in February 2017
 as further described below. Consequently
 we believe that the USA segment is adequately funded at this time to allow us to operate and execute on our business strategy for achieving consistent and positive operational cash flows. We continue to believe that we will be able to obtain additional funds to operate our business
 should it be necessary; however




 the USA segment entered into an $8 million senior secured credit facility agreement with a lender (the &#8220;Lender&#8221;) consisting of a $3.5 million revolving loan
 not to exceed a borrowing base
 as defined in the agreement
 and an initial $2.5 million term loan.&#160; As a result of the credit facility transaction
 the notes for a majority of the subordinated note holders representing approximately 97% of the principal due were amended
 resulting in a $1.9 million loss on extinguishment.&#160; In February 2016
 we issued and sold preferred stock and warrants that netted proceeds of $2.6 million.&#160; In March 2016
 the restricted cash previously held in a $1.9 million escrow account associated with the purchase of Irgovel was released to us pursuant to a court order.&#160; We repaid $1.0 million of the term loan with the Lender upon receipt of funds from the escrow account.&#160; In addition




 we issued and sold preferred stock and warrants that netted approximately $1.85 million after deducting fees and expenses related to the offering.&#160; Additionally
 in February 2017
 we entered into a securities purchase agreement whereby we sold and issued original issue discount senior secured debentures that netted approximately $5.6 million after expenses (together
 the &#8220;February 2017 Transactions&#8221;).&#160; Funds received from the February 2017 Transactions were used to repay amounts due to the Lender in full of approximately $3.8 million




 LLC (&#8220;Nutra SA&#8221;)
 whose only operating subsidiary is Industria Riograndens De Oleos Vegetais Ltda. (&#8220;Irgovel&#8221;)
 located in Pelotas
 Brazil.&#160; Irgovel completed the final stages of a major capital expansion during the first quarter of 2015.&#160; Throughout 2014
 significant cash was used during the shutdown period and subsequent restart of the plant.&#160; In 2016
 2015 and 2014
 we invested $1.1 million
 $3.6 million and $10.3 million
 respectively
 in Nutra SA to fund completion of the capital project and Irgovel working capital needs. Under the terms of the February 2017 Transactions




 the Brazil segment experienced severe cash shortages resulting in an increase in accounts payable (principally to raw bran suppliers) and accrued payroll related tax obligations as we delayed non-essential payments.&#160; The nonpayment of operating liabilities resulted in suppliers refusing to ship raw bran and other materials necessary to maintain steady operation of the plant.&#160; In addition to the working capital issues
 the funds necessary to meet scheduled debt payments no longer existed without additional equity funding. As a result
 the Brazil segment ceased making all bank debt payments in the second and third quarters of 2016.&#160; Discussions have ensued with the related banks with regard to renegotiation of existing debt agreements.&#160; However
 there is no assurance these discussions will be successful. In the second half of 2016
 our minority partner (the &#8220;Investors&#8221;) contributed $1.65 million to Irgovel and an additional $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.&#160; These equity infusions have allowed Irgovel&#8217;s management to negotiate various raw bran supply agreements that will allow Irgovel to obtain rice bran on a consistent basis.

 Brazil segment revenue declined 56% year over year
 and raw bran volume processed declined 54% in 2016.&#160; The decline in revenue in 2016 was due to the continuing challenge of sourcing raw bran caused by a confluence of three issues: (1) adverse weather conditions reducing the volume of rice during harvest
 (2) competition for purchasing raw bran and (3) having sufficient working capital to meet raw bran supplier payment demands.&#160; The decrease in access to raw bran caused a decline in production volume
 resulting in a decrease in revenues.&#160; During the fourth quarter of 2016


































































































































































































































 to $9.6 million in 2016
 from $7.4 million in 2015
in 2015.&#160; Revenue increases for ingredient and animal nutrition products drove down fixed per unit costs and raw bran prices have decreased approximately 9% when comparing to the prior year
 resulting in improved gross profit performance.&#160; However
 this improvement was negated by three factors.&#160; First
 the raw bran supplier for our Mermentau facility was not producing for 13 weeks in 2016
 resulting in shipments to our animal feed customers originating from our California facility
 which resulted in higher costs.&#160; Additionally
 our contract manufacturing accounts have incurred price increases from vendors that we have not yet passed on to customers.&#160; Finally




 primarily due to the three reasons stated above related to weather
 competition for raw bran and insufficient working capital.&#160; Beginning in the first quarter of 2016
 obtaining adequate amounts of raw bran in order to operate the Irgovel plant at an appropriate level has been a challenge.&#160; This caused a 54% decline in raw bran processing volume year over year.&#160; The plant operated at approximately 16% of its targeted capacity of 300 metric tons per day during the third quarter of 2016 resulting in very inefficient operations and significant negative gross profit.&#160; However
 during the fourth quarter
 operating efficiency improved to 47% of targeted capacity.&#160; We expect to see continued improvement in 2017.&#160; For cost reasons
 bagged animal feed production was eliminated in the middle of the first quarter in 2016 and all efforts were shifted to selling bulk animal feed which is a simpler operation that requires less personnel.&#160; Additionally
 because of the significantly reduced supply of raw bran available from rice millers

 there were increases in employee-related expenses

 and in marketing expenses (advertising and tradeshow related).



 Brazil&#8217;s SG&amp;A expenses decreased by $1.3 million.&#160; The change was primarily the result of declines in the exchange rate between the Brazilian Real and the US Dollar. The average exchange rate decreased 5% year over year.&#160; The impact of the exchange rate on expenses offset the one-time severance expenses of $0.2 million related to the reduction in production staff associated with the bagged animal feed production eliminated in the middle of the first quarter 2016.&#160; Additionally

&#8211; The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.&#160; Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates



Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value
 with cost determined by the first-in
 first-out method.&#160; In the USA segment
 we employ a full absorption procedure using standard cost techniques.&#160; The standards are customarily reviewed and adjusted annually so that they are materially consistent with actual purchase and production costs.&#160; In the Brazil segment
 we use actual average purchase and production costs.&#160; Provisions for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory are made based upon our analysis of inventory levels















 including current operating results
 expected market trends and competitive influences.&#160; Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value



 &#8211; We recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss pass to our customers
 generally upon shipment for USA segment customers and Brazil segment international customers and upon customer receipt for Brazil segment domestic customers.&#160; Each transaction is evaluated to determine if all of the following four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred; (iii) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.&#160; If any of the above criteria cannot be satisfied then such a transaction is not recorded as revenue

NOTE 1. GOING CONCERN
 MANAGEMENT PLANS AND GENERAL BUSINESS






 management believes it has plans in place that will mitigate these historical conditions.&#160; Specifically
 we completed an $8 million debt and equity raise in February 2017
 as further described below. Consequently
 we believe that the USA segment is adequately funded at this time to allow us to operate and execute on our business strategy for achieving consistent and positive operational cash flows. We continue to believe that we will be able to obtain additional funds to operate our business
 should it be necessary; however




 the USA segment entered into an $8 million senior secured credit facility agreement with a lender (the &#8220;Lender&#8221;) consisting of a $3.5 million revolving loan
 not to exceed a borrowing base
 as defined in the agreement
 and an initial $2.5 million term loan.&#160; As a result of the credit facility transaction
 the notes for a majority of the subordinated note holders representing approximately 97% of the principal due were amended
 resulting in a $1.9 million loss on extinguishment.&#160; In February 2016
 we issued and sold preferred stock and warrants that netted proceeds of $2.6 million.&#160; In March 2016
 the restricted cash previously held in a $1.9 million escrow account associated with the purchase of Irgovel (see Note 15) was released to us pursuant to a court order.&#160; We repaid $1.0 million of the term loan with the Lender upon receipt of funds from the escrow account.&#160; In addition




 we issued and sold preferred stock and warrants that netted approximately $1.85 million after deducting fees and expenses related to the offering.&#160; Additionally
 in February 2017
 we entered into a securities purchase agreement whereby we sold and issued original issue discount senior secured debentures that netted approximately $5.6 million after expenses (together
 the &#8220;February 2017 Transactions
&#8221; see Note 20 for additional details on these February 2017 Transactions).&#160; Funds received from the February 2017 Transactions were used to repay amounts due to the Lender in full of approximately $3.8 million




 LLC (&#8220;Nutra SA&#8221;)
 whose only operating subsidiary is Industria Riograndens De Oleos Vegetais Ltda. (&#8220;Irgovel&#8221;)
 located in Pelotas
 Brazil.&#160; Irgovel completed the final stages of a major capital expansion during the first quarter of 2015.&#160; Throughout 2014
 significant cash was used during the shutdown period and subsequent restart of the plant.&#160; In 2016
 2015 and 2014
 we invested $1.1 million
 $3.6 million and $10.3 million
 respectively
 in Nutra SA to fund completion of the capital project and Irgovel working capital needs. Under the terms of the February 2017 Transactions




 the Brazil segment experienced severe cash shortages resulting in an increase in accounts payable (principally to raw bran suppliers) and accrued payroll related tax obligations as we delayed non-essential payments.&#160; The nonpayment of operating liabilities resulted in suppliers refusing to ship raw bran and other materials necessary to maintain steady operation of the plant.&#160; In addition to the Brazil segment working capital issues
 the funds necessary to meet scheduled debt payments no longer existed without additional equity funding. As a result
 the Brazil segment ceased making all bank debt payments in the second and third quarters of 2016.&#160; Discussions have ensued with the related banks with regard to renegotiation of existing debt agreements.&#160; However
 there is no assurance these discussions will be successful. In the second half of 2016
 our minority partner (the &#8220;Investors&#8221;) contributed $1.65 million to Irgovel and an additional $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.&#160; With this equity support
 Irgovel management has negotiated various raw bran supply agreements that will allow Irgovel to obtain rice bran on a consistent basis with set pricing. As a result







 animal nutrition and specialty markets focused on value-added processing and marketing of healthy
 natural and nutrient dense products derived from raw rice bran
 an underutilized by-product of the rice milling industry.&#160; We apply our proprietary and patented technologies and intellectual properties to convert raw rice bran into numerous high value products including stabilized rice bran (&#8220;SRB&#8221;)
 rice bran oil (&#8220;RBO&#8221;)
 defatted rice bran (&#8220;DRB&#8221;)
 RiBalance
 a complete rice bran nutritional package derived from further processing of SRB; RiSolubles
 a highly nutritious
 carbohydrate and lipid rich fraction of RiBalance; RiFiber
 a fiber rich insoluble derivative of RiBalance
 and ProRyza
 rice bran protein-based products
 and a variety of other valuable derivatives extracted from these core products.&#160; Our target markets are natural food
 functional food
 nutraceutical supplement and animal nutrition manufacturers
 wholesalers and retailers












 which manufactures and distributes SRB (for food and animal nutrition customers) in various granulations along with Stage II products and derivatives and (ii) Brazil segment
 which extracts crude RBO and DRB from rice bran
 which are then further processed into fully refined rice bran oil for sale internationally and in Brazil
 compounded animal nutrition products for horses
 cows
 swine
 sheep and poultry and a number of valuable food and animal nutrition products derivatives and co-products. Stage II refers to the proprietary
 patented processes run at our Dillon
 Montana facility and includes products produced at that facility. In addition we incur corporate and other expenses not directly attributable to reportable operating segments
 which include costs related to our corporate staff
 general and administrative expenses including public company expenses
 intellectual property
 professional fees
 and other expenses.&#160; No corporate allocations
 including interest





 value-added constituents and finished products.&#160; Over the past decade
 we have developed and optimized our proprietary processes to support the production of healthy
 natural
 hypoallergenic
 gluten free
 and non-genetically modified ingredients and supplements for use in meats
 baked goods
 cereals
 coatings
 health foods
 nutritional supplements





 Louisiana.&#160; A facility located in Lake Charles
 Louisiana has been idle since May 2009.&#160; The USA segment also includes our Dillon
 Montana Stage II facility which produces our Stage II products: RiBalance
 a complete rice bran nutritional package derived from further processing of SRB; RiSolubles
 a highly nutritious
 carbohydrate and lipid rich fraction of RiBalance; RiFiber
 a fiber rich insoluble derivative of RiBalance
 and ProRyza
 rice bran protein-based products
 and a variety of other valuable derivatives extracted from these core products.&#160; The manufacturing facilities included in our USA segment have proprietary processing equipment and process patented technology for the stabilization and further processing of rice bran into finished products.&#160; In 2016




 whose only operating subsidiary is Irgovel
 located in Pelotas
 Brazil.&#160; Irgovel manufactures RBO and DRB products for both the food ingredient and animal nutrition markets in Brazil and internationally.&#160; In refining RBO to an edible grade
 several co-products are obtained.&#160; One such product is distilled fatty acids
 a valuable raw material for the detergent industry.&#160; Irgovel also produces rice lecithin
 which has application in food ingredient products
 animal nutrition and industrial applications.&#160; DRB is compounded with a number of other ingredients to produce complex animal nutrition products which are packaged and sold under Irgovel brands in the Brazilian market
 sold as a raw material for further processing into food ingredient products or sold in bulk into the animal nutrition markets in Brazil and neighboring countries.&#160; In 2016






 &#8211; The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in U.S. Dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities



&#8211; The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.&#160; Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates














 &#8211; We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.&#160; As of December 31
 2016 and 2015



 &#8211; Accounts receivable represent amounts receivable on trade accounts.&#160; The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable.&#160; We analyze the aging of customer accounts
 customer concentrations
 customer credit-worthiness
 current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.&#160; From period to period



Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value
 with cost determined by the first-in
 first-out method.&#160; In the USA segment
 we employ a full absorption procedure using standard cost techniques.&#160; The standards are customarily reviewed and adjusted annually so that they are materially consistent with actual purchase and production costs.&#160; In the Brazil segment
 we use actual average purchase and production costs.&#160; Provisions for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory are made based upon our analysis of inventory levels







 including current operating results
 expected market trends and competitive influences.&#160; Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value



 &#8211; Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. We may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case
 it is necessary to perform a quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test. Otherwise
 the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. The quantitative two-step goodwill impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value. The Company has two reporting units
 which are the same as our operating segments. Multiple valuation techniques can be used to assess the fair value of the reporting unit. All of these techniques include the use of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or goodwill impairment







 including current operating results











 &#8211; We recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss pass to our customers
 generally upon shipment for USA segment customers and Brazil segment international customers and upon customer receipt for Brazil segment domestic customers.&#160; Each transaction is evaluated to determine if all of the following four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred; (iii) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.&#160; If any of the above criteria cannot be satisfied then such a transaction is not recorded as revenue




 discounts and price adjustments when they are reasonably estimable.&#160; Revenues on the statements of operations are net of provisions for estimated returns

Selling

 general and administrative expenses include salaries and wages
 bonuses and incentives
 stock-based compensation expense
 employee-related expenses
 facility-related expenses
 marketing and advertising expense
 depreciation of non-operating property and equipment
 professional fees
 amortization of intangible assets






Share-based compensation expense for stock options granted to employees is calculated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model based on awards ultimately expected to vest
 reduced for estimated forfeitures
 and expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period of the grant.&#160; Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on our historical forfeiture experience and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.&#160; Beginning in 2017
 we will recognize forfeitures as they occur rather than recording an estimated amount.&#160; This will not materially impact our financial statements.&#160; The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model requires us to estimate key assumptions such as expected life
 volatility
 risk-free interest rates and dividend yield to determine the fair value of share-based awards








 whichever is more reliably measured.&#160; Generally we value stock options granted to non-employees and consultants using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model and RSAs at fair value.&#160; If the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used
 it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached or (ii) the date at which the counterparty&#8217;s performance is complete.&#160; The expense associated with stock awards issued to consultants or other third parties are recognized over the term of service.&#160; In the event services are terminated early or we require no specific future performance



 &#8211; The Investors may elect
 until January 1
 2018
 to exchange units in Nutra SA for our common stock (the &#8220;Exchange Right&#8221;).&#160; The appraised fair value of the Investors&#8217; interest in Nutra SA and the market price of our stock would be used to determine the amount of ownership interest the Investors would receive.&#160; The number of common shares and warrants issuable if the Investors elect the Exchange Right is variable and indeterminate.&#160; For accounting purposes
 we are not able to conclude that we have sufficient authorized and unissued shares to settle all contracts subject to the GAAP derivative guidance.&#160; Our adopted sequencing approach is based on earliest issuance date (the &#8220;Share Sequencing&#8221;)
 therefore we are required to record certain warrants issued after the right was granted to the Investors in June 2015 at fair value
 as derivative warrant liabilities.&#160; For the same reason
 the Series F Preferred Stock
 which is convertible to shares of our common stock











 We have certain warrant agreements in effect that contain anti-dilution clauses.&#160; Under these clauses
 we may be required to lower the exercise price on these warrants and issue additional warrants based on future issuances of our common stock and awards of stock options to employees
 additional issuance of warrants and/or other convertible instruments below certain exercise prices.&#160; We account for the warrants with these anti-dilution clauses as liability instruments.&#160; These warrants are valued using the lattice model in each reporting period and the resultant change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in other income (expense).&#160; Additional warrants are recorded as liability instruments due to the Share Sequencing



 &#8211; We use the U.S. Dollar as our reporting currency.&#160; The functional currency for Irgovel is the Brazilian Real.&#160; Assets and liabilities of Irgovel are translated using the exchange rate in effect at the consolidated balance sheet date.&#160; Equity accounts are translated at historical rates
 except for the change in accumulated deficit during the year
 which is the result of the income statement translation process.&#160; Irgovel&#8217;s revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates in effect during the period.&#160; Translation differences are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as foreign currency translation.&#160; Gains or losses on transactions denominated in a currency other than Irgovel&#8217;s functional currency which arise as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates are recorded as foreign exchange gain or loss in the statements of operations. The Brazilian Real exchange rates to the U.S. Dollar at December 31
 2014
 2015 and 2016 were 0.3758
 0.2523 and 0.3069







 when necessary
 to reduce that deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.&#160; The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in Brazil.&#160; Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties
 the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that may be different from current estimates of the tax liabilities.&#160; If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment
 an additional charge to expense would result.&#160; If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts










 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and develop a common revenue standard for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.&#160; Under the new guidance
 an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services
 applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.&#160; An entity may choose to adopt the new standard either retrospectively or through a cumulative effect adjustment as of the start of the first period for which it applies the new standard.&#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2018
 however
 early adoption is permitted.&#160; We have begun to evaluate the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements but have not completed the evaluation and implementation process. We have not yet selected a transition method but have determined that we will utilize the deferred effective date of January 1




 the FASB issued guidance which changes the accounting for leases.&#160; Under prior GAAP
 the recognition
 measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease for us as a lessee depend primarily on the lease&#8217;s classification as a finance or operating lease.&#160; For both types of leases
 lessees will recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.&#160; For capital or finance leases
 lessees will recognize amortization of the right-of-use asset separately from interest expense on the lease liability.&#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2019 and must be adopted on a modified retrospective approach.&#160; Early adoption is allowed.&#160; We have not yet determined the impact that the new guidance will have on our results of operations












 the FASB issued new guidance that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees.&#160; The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled.&#160; In addition
 cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows.&#160; The guidance also allows us to repurchase more of an employee&#8217;s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting
 clarifies that all cash payments made on an employee&#8217;s behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on our cash flows statement
 and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur.&#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2017 with early adoption permitted.&#160; We plan to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2017 and change our accounting policy to recognize forfeitures as they occur.&#160; This change will not have a material effect on our results of operations as we currently do not apply an estimated forfeiture rate to restricted stock awards to our officers and directors.&#160; Additionally
 most of our outstanding stock option awards vest on a monthly basis over the vesting period (generally three or four years).&#160; As these awards do not have performance conditions




 the FASB issued a new credit loss standard that replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP.&#160; The new impairment model requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur for most financial assets and certain other instruments.&#160; It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods.&#160; Early adoption for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018 is permitted.&#160; Entities will apply the standard&#8217;s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first effective reporting period.&#160; We have not yet determined the impact that the new guidance will have on our results of operations




 the FASB issued a new goodwill impairment standard that simplifies the goodwill impairment testing methodology.&#160; The new standard eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test
 in which an entity determines the fair value at the test date of its assets and liabilities using the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.&#160; It is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019.&#160; Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1
 2017.&#160; We will early adopt the standard as of January 1







 the FASB issued guidance which makes targeted amendments to current consolidation guidance.&#160; Among other things
 the standard changes the manner in which we would assess one of the characteristics of variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;) and introduces a separate analysis specific to limited partnerships and similar entities (such as Nutra SA
 LLC) for assessing if the equity holders at risk lack decision making authority.&#160; Limited partnerships and similar entities will be a VIE unless the limited partners hold substantive kick-out rights or participating rights.&#160; A right to liquidate an entity is akin to a kick-out right.&#160; Guidance for limited partnerships under the voting model has been eliminated.&#160; A limited partner and similar partners with a controlling financial interest obtained through substantive kick-out rights would consolidate a limited partnership or similar entity.&#160; Upon adoption in the first quarter of 2016
 there was no impact on our financial position or results of operations.&#160; Specifically
 under the new guidance
 we continue to be the primary beneficiary of Nutra SA




 the FASB issued guidance which requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements.&#160; Certain disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt about an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern&#160; The guidance applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15
 2016
 and interim periods thereafter
 with early adoption permitted.&#160; We adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2016

 we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement (&#8220;MIPA&#8221;) with AF Bran Holdings-NL LLC and AF Bran Holdings LLC (the &#8220;Investors&#8221;).&#160; The Investors&#8217; share of Nutra SA&#8217;s net income (loss) increases (decreases) redeemable noncontrolling interest.&#160; Our variable interest in Nutra SA is our Brazil segment.&#160; We are the primary beneficiary of Nutra SA

 the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interest reflects a deficit balance beginning in the second quarter of 2016.&#160; This deficit balance is reflected in the total (deficit) equity attributable to RiceBran Technologies shareholders section of our consolidated balance sheet at December 31

 we entered into an $8 million senior secured credit facility agreement with a lender (the &#8220;Lender&#8221;) consisting of a $3.5 million revolving loan
 not to exceed a borrowing base
 as defined in the agreement
 and an initial $2.5 million term loan
 which term loan may be increased at the Lender&#8217;s discretion by up to $2.0 million within 2 years.&#160; The funds were used for general corporate purposes and to provide working capital to facilitate future growth.&#160; The facility is secured by a senior interest in substantially all of our assets
 excluding half of our interest in Nutra SA and RBT PRO
 LLC.&#160; The credit facility matures on June 1
 2018
 with the potential for two one-year maturity extensions.&#160; The loan bears interest at a variable interest rate based on LIBOR
 with a 0.75% floor and 1.25% cap

 we entered into an agreement with the Lender which modified the financial covenants to require that (a) from February 1
 2016 to July 15
 2016
 we maintain cash on hand
 including availability under our revolving loan with the Lender
 of not less than $1.5 million provided that at least $0.8 million of such amount must be in the form of cash on hand
 and (b) we maintain an average monthly adjusted EBITDA
 as defined by the agreement
 calculated over each consecutive three-month period beginning on January 1
&#160; February 1
 March 1
 April 1 and May 1
 2016
 of not less than $0.1 million.&#160; The Lender also waived
 for the first two quarters of 2016
 any non-compliance with the financial covenants in the May 2015 agreement.&#160; The amendment with the Lender requires that we repay $1.0 million of the senior term note which occurred on March 24
 2016.&#160; In consideration for the amendments




 we amended our agreements with the Lender to extend the prior modification of the loan agreement to December 31
 2016&#160; The amendments required that we maintain cash on hand
 including availability under our revolving loan with the Lender
 of not less than approximately $1.3 million

 which was added to the outstanding loan balance.&#160; The Lender also waived
 for the first three quarters of 2016
 any non-compliance with the financial covenants in the May 2015 agreement.&#160; In November 2016

 including availability under our revolving loan with the Lender
 of not less than approximately $1.0 million

 which was added to the outstanding loan balance.










 the terms of subordinated notes in the principal amount of $6.3 million were amended to extend the maturity dates from July 2016 to May 2018 and change the interest rate from 5% per year to an annual interest rate of LIBOR (as defined in the amendment) plus 11% (currently 11.75%) (the &#8220;Note Amendment&#8221;).&#160; Interest is payable quarterly.&#160; Principal was payable in seven quarterly installments of $0.3 million beginning in October 2016
 with the remainder of principal due in May 2018.&#160; The holders of these notes received warrants to acquire 289
670 shares of common stock in the aggregate (exercise price of $5.25
 May 2020 expiration).&#160; We accounted for the amendment as an extinguishment and reissuance.&#160; We recognized a $1.9 million loss on extinguishment equal to the total of (i) the difference between the $5.1 million carrying value of the notes on the date of the transaction and the $6.3 million face value of the notes and (ii) the $0.7 million fair value of the warrants at issuance.&#160; These notes are secured by a subordinated interest in substantially all of our assets

 from time to time we are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business in the USA and Brazil.&#160; These matters may relate to employment and labor claims
 patent and intellectual property claims
 claims of alleged non-compliance with contract provisions and claims related to alleged violations of laws and regulations.&#160; When applicable

 2008
 former Irgovel stockholder David Resyng filed an indemnification suit against Irgovel
 Osmar Brito and the remaining former Irgovel stockholders (&#8220;Sellers&#8221;)
 requesting:&#160; (i) the freezing of the escrow account maintained in connection with the transfer of Irgovel&#8217;s corporate control to us and the presentation of all documentation related to the transaction
 and (ii) damages in the amount of the difference between (a) the sum received by David Resyng in connection with the judicial settlement agreement executed in the action for the partial dissolution of the limited liability company filed by David Resyng against Irgovel and the Sellers and (b) the amount received by the Sellers in connection with the sale of Irgovel&#8217;s corporate control to us




 executed by and among the Sellers and us on January 31
 2008 (&#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;).&#160; Consequently
 we believe that the responsibility for any indemnity




 2009
 the Sellers filed a collection lawsuit against us seeking payment of the second installment of the purchase price under the Purchase Agreement
 which the Sellers assert is approximately $1.0 million.&#160; We have withheld payment of the second installment pending resolution of the Resyng lawsuit noted above.&#160; RiceBran Technologies
 the parent company
 has not been served with any formal notices in regard to this matter.&#160; To date
 only Irgovel has received formal legal notice.&#160; In addition
 the Purchase Agreement requires that all disputes between us and the Sellers be adjudicated through arbitration.&#160; In 2015




 $2.0 million was deposited into an escrow account to cover contingencies with the net remaining funds payable to the Sellers upon resolution of all contingencies.&#160; As of December 31
 2015
 the balance in the escrow account was $1.9 million and was included in restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet.&#160; On January 12
 2016
 the US District Court for the District of Arizona entered a final judgment in our favor affirming the arbitration award received in Brazil.&#160; On March 24
 2016
 the $1.9 million in the escrow account was released to us to fund the award owed to us by the Sellers and
 as required under an agreement with the Lender












 the Brazilian court ordered Irgovel not to access those funds under the premise that the Sellers may have a right to those funds as originally contemplated in the Purchase Agreement.&#160; A fine of R$10
000 per day for violating that order was established by the court.&#160; From the escrow release date of March 24
 2016 through today
 no fine has been imposed.&#160; We believe that with the final judgment in our favor
 the Sellers no longer have any possible legal claim on the escrow funds and
 thus











 mainly related to overtime
 illnesses allegedly contracted at work and work-related injuries and salary related matters for periods prior to the acquisition of Irgovel by RiceBran. The labor suits are mainly in the lower courts
 and for the majority of the cases a decision for the dismissal of the claims has been granted. None of these labor claims is individually significant.&#160; Management believes it&#8217;s unlikely there will be a judgment against Irgovel
 however
 in the event the court does issue a judgment against Irgovel
 it could be approximately $900




 formalized or not
 as a result of a past event
 it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Irgovel is a party to other several pending litigations and administrative proceedings at the Federal
 State and Municipal level. The assessment of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in these litigations and proceedings includes the analysis of the evidence available
 the hierarchy of the applicable laws
 available former court decisions
 as well as the most recent court decisions and their importance to the Brazilian legal system







 Irgovel is required to meet minimum annual processing targets or to achieve EBITDA on a local currency basis of at least R$4.0 million annually. If not achieved
 this would result in an event of default.&#160; It is possible that an event of default may be triggered and a waiver of non-compliance may not be obtained from the Investors. At December 31

 we periodically enter into employment agreements which incorporate indemnification provisions.&amp;#160; While the maximum amount to which we may be exposed under such agreements cannot be reasonably estimated
 we maintain insurance coverage


 2016



 from time to time we are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business in the USA and Brazil.&amp;#160; These matters may relate to employment and labor claims
 patent and intellectual property claims
 claims of alleged non-compliance with contract provisions and claims related to alleged violations of laws and regulations.&amp;#160; When applicable
 we record accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.&amp;#160; While the outcome of lawsuits and other proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty
 in the opinion of management
 individually or in the aggregate

 2008
 former Irgovel stockholder David Resyng filed an indemnification suit against Irgovel
 Osmar Brito and the remaining former Irgovel stockholders (&amp;#8220;Sellers&amp;#8221;)
 requesting:&amp;#160; (i) the freezing of the escrow account maintained in connection with the transfer of Irgovel&amp;#8217;s corporate control to us and the presentation of all documentation related to the transaction
 and (ii) damages in the amount of the difference between (a) the sum received by David Resyng in connection with the judicial settlement agreement executed in the action for the partial dissolution of the limited liability company filed by David Resyng against Irgovel and the Sellers and (b) the amount received by the Sellers in connection with the sale of Irgovel&amp;#8217;s corporate control to us
 in addition to moral damages as determined in the court&amp;#8217;s discretion.&amp;#160; The amount of damage claimed by Mr. Resyng is approximately $3.0 million.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;We believe that the filing of the above lawsuit is a fundamental default of the obligations undertaken by the Sellers under the quotas purchase agreement for the transfer of Irgovel&amp;#8217;s corporate control
 executed by and among the Sellers and us on January 31
 2008 (&amp;#8220;Purchase Agreement&amp;#8221;).&amp;#160; Consequently
 we believe that the responsibility for any indemnity
 costs and expenses incurred or that may come to be incurred by Irgovel and/or us in connection with the above lawsuit is the sole responsibility of the Sellers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;On February 6
 2009
 the Sellers filed a collection lawsuit against us seeking payment of the second installment of the purchase price under the Purchase Agreement
 which the Sellers assert is approximately $1.0 million.&amp;#160; We have withheld payment of the second installment pending resolution of the Resyng lawsuit noted above.&amp;#160; RiceBran Technologies
 the parent company
 has not been served with any formal notices in regard to this matter.&amp;#160; To date
 only Irgovel has received formal legal notice.&amp;#160; In addition
 the Purchase Agreement requires that all disputes between us and the Sellers be adjudicated through arbitration.&amp;#160; In 2015
 a final unappealable arbitration award was granted in our favor.&amp;#160; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;As part of the Purchase Agreement
 $2.0 million was deposited into an escrow account to cover contingencies with the net remaining funds payable to the Sellers upon resolution of all contingencies.&amp;#160; As of December 31
 2015
 the balance in the escrow account was $1.9 million and was included in restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet.&amp;#160; On January 12
 2016
 the US District Court for the District of Arizona entered a final judgment in our favor affirming the arbitration award received in Brazil.&amp;#160; On March 24
 2016
 the $1.9 million in the escrow account was released to us to fund the award owed to us by the Sellers and
 as required under an agreement with the Lender

 the Brazilian court ordered Irgovel not to access those funds under the premise that the Sellers may have a right to those funds as originally contemplated in the Purchase Agreement.&amp;#160; A fine of R$10
000 per day for violating that order was established by the court.&amp;#160; From the escrow release date of March 24
 2016 through today
 no fine has been imposed.&amp;#160; We believe that with the final judgment in our favor
 the Sellers no longer have any possible legal claim on the escrow funds and
 thus
 the court will remove the freeze.&amp;#160; We are working with counsel in Brazil to effectuate that outcome.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;We believe that there are no significant remaining contingencies.&amp;#160; We recognized a gain of $1.6 million in 2016

 mainly related to overtime
 illnesses allegedly contracted at work and work-related injuries and salary related matters for periods prior to the acquisition of Irgovel by RiceBran. The labor suits are mainly in the lower courts
 and for the majority of the cases a decision for the dismissal of the claims has been granted. None of these labor claims is individually significant.&amp;#160; Management believes it&amp;#8217;s unlikely there will be a judgment against Irgovel
 however
 in the event the court does issue a judgment against Irgovel
 it could be approximately $900
000 (USD).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;Irgovel accrues for losses on tax and other legal contingencies when it has a present obligation
 formalized or not
 as a result of a past event
 it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Irgovel is a party to other several pending litigations and administrative proceedings at the Federal
 State and Municipal level. The assessment of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in these litigations and proceedings includes the analysis of the evidence available
 the hierarchy of the applicable laws
 available former court decisions
 as well as the most recent court decisions and their importance to the Brazilian legal system

 Irgovel is required to meet minimum annual processing targets or to achieve EBITDA on a local currency basis of at least R$4.0 million annually. If not achieved
 this would result in an event of default.&amp;#160; It is possible that an event of default may be triggered and a waiver of non-compliance may not be obtained from the Investors. At December 31
 2016

 we entered into an $8 million senior secured credit facility agreement with a lender (the &amp;#8220;Lender&amp;#8221;) consisting of a $3.5 million revolving loan
 not to exceed a borrowing base
 as defined in the agreement
 and an initial $2.5 million term loan
 which term loan may be increased at the Lender&amp;#8217;s discretion by up to $2.0 million within 2 years.&amp;#160; The funds were used for general corporate purposes and to provide working capital to facilitate future growth.&amp;#160; The facility is secured by a senior interest in substantially all of our assets
 excluding half of our interest in Nutra SA and RBT PRO
 LLC.&amp;#160; The credit facility matures on June 1
 2018
 with the potential for two one-year maturity extensions.&amp;#160; The loan bears interest at a variable interest rate based on LIBOR
 with a 0.75% floor and 1.25% cap
 plus 10.75% per annum
 (11.5% at December 31

000 shares of common stock (exercise price of $5.25
 May 2020 expiration) to the Lender (see Note 11 for additional information related to the repricing of this warrant).&amp;#160; As of December 31
 2016
 the fair value of the warrant is $0.1 million.&amp;#160; As of December 31
 2016
 the remaining unamortized discount on the term note is $0.3 million.&amp;#160; As of December 31
 2016

 we entered into an agreement with the Lender which modified the financial covenants to require that (a) from February 1
 2016 to July 15
 2016
 we maintain cash on hand
 including availability under our revolving loan with the Lender
 of not less than $1.5 million provided that at least $0.8 million of such amount must be in the form of cash on hand
 and (b) we maintain an average monthly adjusted EBITDA
 as defined by the agreement
 calculated over each consecutive three-month period beginning on January 1
&amp;#160; February 1
 March 1
 April 1 and May 1
 2016
 of not less than $0.1 million.&amp;#160; The Lender also waived
 for the first two quarters of 2016
 any non-compliance with the financial covenants in the May 2015 agreement.&amp;#160; The amendment with the Lender requires that we repay $1.0 million of the senior term note which occurred on March 24
 2016.&amp;#160; In consideration for the amendments
 we paid and expensed $0.1 million to the Lender in 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;In June 2016 and September 2016
 we amended our agreements with the Lender to extend the prior modification of the loan agreement to December 31
 2016&amp;#160; The amendments required that we maintain cash on hand
 including availability under our revolving loan with the Lender
 of not less than approximately $1.3 million
 provided that at least $0.5 million of such amount must be in the form of cash on hand (see Note 11 for additional information related to the repricing of the &lt;font style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';&gt;warrant associated with these modifications).&amp;#160; We also paid an approximately $0.2 million amendment fee in the third quarter of 2016
 which was added to the outstanding loan balance.&amp;#160; The Lender also waived
 for the first three quarters of 2016
 any non-compliance with the financial covenants in the May 2015 agreement.&amp;#160; In November 2016
 we entered into a limited waiver and amendment agreement with the Lender to waive any specified defaults (as defined in the agreement) and requiring we maintain&lt;/font&gt; cash on hand
 including availability under our revolving loan with the Lender
 of not less than approximately $1.0 million
 provided that at least $0.3 million of such amount must be in the form of cash on hand.&amp;#160; &lt;font style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';&gt;We also paid an approximately $0.2 million extension fee in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to this agreement
 which was added to the outstanding loan balance.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;See Note 20 for additional information related to 2017 debt refinancing transactions

 the terms of subordinated notes in the principal amount of $6.3 million were amended to extend the maturity dates from July 2016 to May 2018 and change the interest rate from 5% per year to an annual interest rate of LIBOR (as defined in the amendment) plus 11% (currently 11.75%) (the &amp;#8220;Note Amendment&amp;#8221;).&amp;#160; Interest is payable quarterly.&amp;#160; Principal was payable in seven quarterly installments of $0.3 million beginning in October 2016
 with the remainder of principal due in May 2018.&amp;#160; The holders of these notes received warrants to acquire 289
670 shares of common stock in the aggregate (exercise price of $5.25
 May 2020 expiration).&amp;#160; We accounted for the amendment as an extinguishment and reissuance.&amp;#160; We recognized a $1.9 million loss on extinguishment equal to the total of (i) the difference between the $5.1 million carrying value of the notes on the date of the transaction and the $6.3 million face value of the notes and (ii) the $0.7 million fair value of the warrants at issuance.&amp;#160; These notes are secured by a subordinated interest in substantially all of our assets
 excluding our interest in Nutra SA and RBT PRO


 2016
 Brazil had approximately $0.5 million (USD) of installment loans in arrears.&amp;#160; The banks have not called these loans in default
 and management continues to work with the lenders to renegotiate payment terms
 however
 all Brazil segment debt has been classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31
 2016.&amp;#160; All Brazil segment debt is denominated in the Brazilian Real (R$)

 Irgovel entered into loan agreements with the Bank of Brazil.&amp;#160; As of December 31
 2016
 the remaining notes held a principal balance of R$8.0 million. The annual interest rate on the loans is 6.5%
 payable quarterly and the loans mature December 2021.&amp;#160; Irgovel must make monthly principal payments under each of the loans.&amp;#160; In July 2012

 depending on the agreement.&amp;#160; The annual interest rates on this debt range from 8.4% to 34.8%

 which was 13.8% at December 31

 2016
 we are in compliance with the provisions and financial covenants associated with our debt agreements

 Goodwill


 it is necessary to perform a quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test. Otherwise
 the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. The quantitative two-step goodwill impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value. The Company has two reporting units
 which are the same as our operating segments. Multiple valuation techniques can be used to assess the fair value of the reporting unit. All of these techniques include the use of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or goodwill impairment

 specifically related to our Brazil segment
 including a decline in raw bran availability and continuing operating losses resulting in a lack of working capital.&amp;#160; Due to the lack of working capital
 the Brazil segment ceased making all bank debt payments in the second quarter of 2016.&amp;#160; These events resulted in the need to perform an interim impairment test of our goodwill as of June 30
 2016
 which resulted in an estimated goodwill write-down of $3.0 million in the second quarter of 2016
 which was recorded in our Brazil segment. In the third quarter of 2016
 we completed the two-step goodwill impairment assessment to determine if any adjustment to the goodwill impairment charge was required.&amp;#160; Based on the assessment
 no modification of the initial impairment estimated was required in the third quarter of 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;We performed a qualitative test of goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2016.&amp;#160; The results of the impairment test indicated that the fair value of our USA segment related goodwill was in excess of the carrying value

 the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that may be different from current estimates of the tax liabilities.&amp;#160; If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and develop a common revenue standard for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.&amp;#160; Under the new guidance
 an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services
 applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.&amp;#160; An entity may choose to adopt the new standard either retrospectively or through a cumulative effect adjustment as of the start of the first period for which it applies the new standard.&amp;#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2018
 however
 early adoption is permitted.&amp;#160; We have begun to evaluate the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements but have not completed the evaluation and implementation process. We have not yet selected a transition method but have determined that we will utilize the deferred effective date of January 1
 2018 to adopt the standard.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;In February 2016
 the FASB issued guidance which changes the accounting for leases.&amp;#160; Under prior GAAP
 the recognition
 measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease for us as a lessee depend primarily on the lease&amp;#8217;s classification as a finance or operating lease.&amp;#160; For both types of leases
 lessees will recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.&amp;#160; For capital or finance leases
 lessees will recognize amortization of the right-of-use asset separately from interest expense on the lease liability.&amp;#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2019 and must be adopted on a modified retrospective approach.&amp;#160; Early adoption is allowed.&amp;#160; We have not yet determined the impact that the new guidance will have on our results of operations

 the FASB issued new guidance that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees.&amp;#160; The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled.&amp;#160; In addition
 cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows.&amp;#160; The guidance also allows us to repurchase more of an employee&amp;#8217;s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting
 clarifies that all cash payments made on an employee&amp;#8217;s behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on our cash flows statement
 and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur.&amp;#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2017 with early adoption permitted.&amp;#160; We plan to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2017 and change our accounting policy to recognize forfeitures as they occur.&amp;#160; This change will not have a material effect on our results of operations as we currently do not apply an estimated forfeiture rate to restricted stock awards to our officers and directors.&amp;#160; Additionally
 most of our outstanding stock option awards vest on a monthly basis over the vesting period (generally three or four years).&amp;#160; As these awards do not have performance conditions
 the expense is recognized each month on a straight-line basis and excludes the effect of the estimated forfeiture rate as there is no risk of expensing awards that would be subsequently forfeited prior to vesting.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;In June 2016
 the FASB issued a new credit loss standard that replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP.&amp;#160; The new impairment model requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur for most financial assets and certain other instruments.&amp;#160; It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods.&amp;#160; Early adoption for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018 is permitted.&amp;#160; Entities will apply the standard&amp;#8217;s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first effective reporting period.&amp;#160; We have not yet determined the impact that the new guidance will have on our results of operations
 financial position and cash flows and have not yet determined if we will early adopt the standard.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;In January 2017
 the FASB issued a new goodwill impairment standard that simplifies the goodwill impairment testing methodology.&amp;#160; The new standard eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test
 in which an entity determines the fair value at the test date of its assets and liabilities using the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.&amp;#160; It is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019.&amp;#160; Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1
 2017.&amp;#160; We will early adopt the standard as of January 1

 the FASB issued guidance which makes targeted amendments to current consolidation guidance.&amp;#160; Among other things
 the standard changes the manner in which we would assess one of the characteristics of variable interest entities (&amp;#8220;VIEs&amp;#8221;) and introduces a separate analysis specific to limited partnerships and similar entities (such as Nutra SA
 LLC) for assessing if the equity holders at risk lack decision making authority.&amp;#160; Limited partnerships and similar entities will be a VIE unless the limited partners hold substantive kick-out rights or participating rights.&amp;#160; A right to liquidate an entity is akin to a kick-out right.&amp;#160; Guidance for limited partnerships under the voting model has been eliminated.&amp;#160; A limited partner and similar partners with a controlling financial interest obtained through substantive kick-out rights would consolidate a limited partnership or similar entity.&amp;#160; Upon adoption in the first quarter of 2016
 there was no impact on our financial position or results of operations.&amp;#160; Specifically
 under the new guidance
 we continue to be the primary beneficiary of Nutra SA
 LLC.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;In August 2014
 the FASB issued guidance which requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements.&amp;#160; Certain disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt about an entity&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern&amp;#160; The guidance applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15
 2016
 and interim periods thereafter
 with early adoption permitted.&amp;#160; We adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2016

 2016
 W. John Short&amp;#8217;s employment as our chief executive officer was terminated.&amp;#160; On November 18
 2016
 the Company and Mr. Short entered into a Mutual Release Agreement (the &amp;#8220;Release Agreement&amp;#8221;)
 under which we resolved all matters related to Mr. Short&amp;#8217;s separation from employment with the Company and Mr. Short&amp;#8217;s service on our board of directors. The Release Agreement was effective on November 23
 2016. Pursuant to the Release Agreement
 Mr. Short resigned from our board of directors
 which resignation was effective November 29
 2016.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;Pursuant to the Release Agreement
 Mr. Short will receive the following payments: (i) an initial payment of $220
000; (ii) an additional payment of $225
000
 payable on or before January 15
 2017; (iii) fifteen equal monthly installments of $17
000
 with the first installment being paid on or before February 15
 2017; and (iv) $80
000
 which represents the value of Mr. Short&amp;#8217;s compensation had he continued to serve on our board of directors.&amp;#160; Payment of the amounts described in parts (i)
 (ii) and (iv) of this paragraph were made in accordance with the Release Agreement.&amp;#160; Payment of the amounts described in part (iii) of this paragraph will accelerate in the event we complete certain asset sales
 other than those made in the ordinary course of business.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;In addition to the payments described above
 the Release Agreement also provides for (i) a mutual release by Mr. Short and the Company
 (ii) payment to Mr. Short&amp;#8217;s attorneys for legal fees incurred by Mr. Short in connection with matters related to Mr. Short&amp;#8217;s employment agreement and this Release Agreement
 and (iii) full vesting of any unvested restricted stock held by Mr. Short.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;During 2016
 the USA segment recorded severance expense of approximately $0.7 million associated with the Release Agreement
 of which $0.3 million had been paid as of December 31
 2016.&amp;#160; The remaining outstanding obligations as of December 31

 generally upon shipment for USA segment customers and Brazil segment international customers and upon customer receipt for Brazil segment domestic customers.&amp;#160; Each transaction is evaluated to determine if all of the following four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred; (iii) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.&amp;#160; If any of the above criteria cannot be satisfied then such a transaction is not recorded as revenue
 or is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized only when the sales cycle is complete and payment is either received or becomes reasonably assured.&amp;#160; Changes in judgments and estimates regarding the application of the above mentioned four criteria might result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized by such transactions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;We make provisions for estimated returns
 discounts and price adjustments when they are reasonably estimable.&amp;#160; Revenues on the statements of operations are net of provisions for estimated returns
 routine sales discounts




 resulting in accumulated deficit of $260 million&amp;#160;which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of this filing.&amp;#160; Despite these historical losses and negative cash flows
 management believes it has plans in place that will mitigate these historical conditions. Specifically
 we completed an $8 million debt and equity raise in February 2017
 as further described below. Consequently
 we believe that the USA segment is adequately funded at this time to allow us to operate and execute on our business strategy for achieving consistent and positive operational cash flows. We continue to believe that we will be able to obtain additional funds to operate our business
 should it be necessary; however
 there can be no assurances that our efforts will prove successful.&amp;#160; The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;In May 2015
 the USA segment entered into an $8 million senior secured credit facility agreement with a lender (the &amp;#8220;Lender&amp;#8221;) consisting of a $3.5 million revolving loan
 not to exceed a borrowing base
 as defined in the agreement
 and an initial $2.5 million term loan.&amp;#160; As a result of the credit facility transaction
 the notes for a majority of the subordinated note holders representing approximately 97% of the principal due were amended
 resulting in a $1.9 million loss on extinguishment.&amp;#160; In February 2016
 we issued and sold preferred stock and warrants that netted proceeds of $2.6 million.&amp;#160; In March 2016
 the restricted cash previously held in a $1.9 million escrow account associated with the purchase of Irgovel (see Note 15) was released to us pursuant to a court order.&amp;#160; We repaid $1.0 million of the term loan with the Lender upon receipt of funds from the escrow account.&amp;#160; In addition
 we repaid a $0.3 million short-term note from a related party (see Note 17).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;In February 2017
 we issued and sold preferred stock and warrants that netted approximately $1.85 million after deducting fees and expenses related to the offering.&amp;#160; Additionally
 in February 2017
 we entered into a securities purchase agreement whereby we sold and issued original issue discount senior secured debentures that netted approximately $5.6 million after expenses (together
 the &amp;#8220;February 2017 Transactions
&amp;#8221; see Note 20 for additional details on these February 2017 Transactions).&amp;#160; Funds received from the February 2017 Transactions were used to repay amounts due to the Lender in full of approximately $3.8 million
 pay down the principal balance and interest due to the subordinated note holders totaling $0.5 million and for working capital and capital expenditure needs in our USA segment.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;The Brazil segment consists of the consolidated operations of Nutra SA

 whose only operating subsidiary is Industria Riograndens De Oleos Vegetais Ltda. (&amp;#8220;Irgovel&amp;#8221;)
 located in Pelotas
 Brazil.&amp;#160; Irgovel completed the final stages of a major capital expansion during the first quarter of 2015.&amp;#160; Throughout 2014
 significant cash was used during the shutdown period and subsequent restart of the plant.&amp;#160; In 2016
 2015 and 2014
 we invested $1.1 million
 $3.6 million and $10.3 million
 respectively
 in Nutra SA to fund completion of the capital project and Irgovel working capital needs. Under the terms of the February 2017 Transactions
 we are prohibited from contributing additional funding to Irgovel.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;Beginning in the second quarter of 2016 and through the fourth quarter of 2016
 the Brazil segment experienced severe cash shortages resulting in an increase in accounts payable (principally to raw bran suppliers) and accrued payroll related tax obligations as we delayed non-essential payments.&amp;#160; The nonpayment of operating liabilities resulted in suppliers refusing to ship raw bran and other materials necessary to maintain steady operation of the plant.&amp;#160; In addition to the Brazil segment working capital issues
 the funds necessary to meet scheduled debt payments no longer existed without additional equity funding. As a result
 the Brazil segment ceased making all bank debt payments in the second and third quarters of 2016.&amp;#160; Discussions have ensued with the related banks with regard to renegotiation of existing debt agreements.&amp;#160; However
 there is no assurance these discussions will be successful. In the second half of 2016
 our minority partner (the &amp;#8220;Investors&amp;#8221;) contributed $1.65 million to Irgovel and an additional $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.&amp;#160; With this equity support
 Irgovel management has negotiated various raw bran supply agreements that will allow Irgovel to obtain rice bran on a consistent basis with set pricing. As a result

 animal nutrition and specialty markets focused on value-added processing and marketing of healthy
 natural and nutrient dense products derived from raw rice bran

 we entered into a note payable with a director in the principal amount of $0.3 million and issued the director a warrant to acquire 25
000 share of common stock (exercise price of $5.25
 exercisable immediately and expiring in January 2021).&amp;#160; On the date of issuance
 we recorded the warrant at fair value as a derivative warrant liability
 pursuant to the Share Sequencing

 we entered into an additional amendment agreement with our Lender to extend the prior modification of the loan agreement.&amp;#160; In connection with this amendment
 we repriced the warrant held by the Lender from $1.85 per share to $1.60 per share.&amp;#160; Both prior to and subsequent to these modifications

 the RSAs that vested for employees in the United States were net-share settled such that we withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees&amp;#8217; minimum statutory United States tax obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes and remitted the equivalent cash amount to the appropriate taxing authorities.&amp;#160; The total shares withheld during 2016 of 42

 total payments for the employees&amp;#8217; tax obligations to the taxing authorities were approximately $43

 first-out method.&amp;#160; In the USA segment
 we employ a full absorption procedure using standard cost techniques.&amp;#160; The standards are customarily reviewed and adjusted annually so that they are materially consistent with actual purchase and production costs.&amp;#160; In the Brazil segment

 it is necessary to perform a quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test. Otherwise
 the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. The quantitative two-step goodwill impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value. The Company has two reporting units
 which are the same as our operating segments. Multiple valuation techniques can be used to assess the fair value of the reporting unit. All of these techniques include the use of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or goodwill impairment

 including current operating results

 generally upon shipment for USA segment customers and Brazil segment international customers and upon customer receipt for Brazil segment domestic customers.&amp;#160; Each transaction is evaluated to determine if all of the following four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred; (iii) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.&amp;#160; If any of the above criteria cannot be satisfied then such a transaction is not recorded as revenue
 or is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized only when the sales cycle is complete and payment is either received or becomes reasonably assured.&amp;#160; Changes in judgments and estimates regarding the application of the above mentioned four criteria might result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized by such transactions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;We make provisions for estimated returns

 we are not able to conclude that we have sufficient authorized and unissued shares to settle all contracts subject to the GAAP derivative guidance.&amp;#160; Our adopted sequencing approach is based on earliest issuance date (the &amp;#8220;Share Sequencing&amp;#8221;)
 therefore we are required to record certain warrants issued after the right was granted to the Investors in June 2015 at fair value
 as derivative warrant liabilities.&amp;#160; For the same reason
 the Series F Preferred Stock
 which is convertible to shares of our common stock

 we may be required to lower the exercise price on these warrants and issue additional warrants based on future issuances of our common stock and awards of stock options to employees
 additional issuance of warrants and/or other convertible instruments below certain exercise prices.&amp;#160; We account for the warrants with these anti-dilution clauses as liability instruments.&amp;#160; These warrants are valued using the lattice model in each reporting period and the resultant change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in other income (expense).&amp;#160; Additional warrants are recorded as liability instruments due to the Share Sequencing

 except for the change in accumulated deficit during the year
 which is the result of the income statement translation process.&amp;#160; Irgovel&amp;#8217;s revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates in effect during the period.&amp;#160; Translation differences are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as foreign currency translation.&amp;#160; Gains or losses on transactions denominated in a currency other than Irgovel&amp;#8217;s functional currency which arise as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates are recorded as foreign exchange gain or loss in the statements of operations.

 to reduce that deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.&amp;#160; The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in Brazil.&amp;#160; Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties
 the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that may be different from current estimates of the tax liabilities.&amp;#160; If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment
 an additional charge to expense would result.&amp;#160; If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and develop a common revenue standard for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.&amp;#160; Under the new guidance
 an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services
 applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.&amp;#160; An entity may choose to adopt the new standard either retrospectively or through a cumulative effect adjustment as of the start of the first period for which it applies the new standard.&amp;#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2018
 however
 early adoption is permitted.&amp;#160; We have begun to evaluate the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements but have not completed the evaluation and implementation process. We have not yet selected a transition method but have determined that we will utilize the deferred effective date of January 1
 2018 to adopt the standard.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;In February 2016
 the FASB issued guidance which changes the accounting for leases.&amp;#160; Under prior GAAP
 the recognition
 measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease for us as a lessee depend primarily on the lease&amp;#8217;s classification as a finance or operating lease.&amp;#160; For both types of leases
 lessees will recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.&amp;#160; For capital or finance leases
 lessees will recognize amortization of the right-of-use asset separately from interest expense on the lease liability.&amp;#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2019 and must be adopted on a modified retrospective approach.&amp;#160; Early adoption is allowed.&amp;#160; We have not yet determined the impact that the new guidance will have on our results of operations

 the FASB issued new guidance that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees.&amp;#160; The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled.&amp;#160; In addition
 cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows.&amp;#160; The guidance also allows us to repurchase more of an employee&amp;#8217;s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting
 clarifies that all cash payments made on an employee&amp;#8217;s behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on our cash flows statement
 and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur.&amp;#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2017 with early adoption permitted.&amp;#160; We plan to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2017 and change our accounting policy to recognize forfeitures as they occur.&amp;#160; This change will not have a material effect on our results of operations as we currently do not apply an estimated forfeiture rate to restricted stock awards to our officers and directors.&amp;#160; Additionally
 most of our outstanding stock option awards vest on a monthly basis over the vesting period (generally three or four years).&amp;#160; As these awards do not have performance conditions
 the expense is recognized each month on a straight-line basis and excludes the effect of the estimated forfeiture rate as there is no risk of expensing awards that would be subsequently forfeited prior to vesting.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;In June 2016
 the FASB issued a new credit loss standard that replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP.&amp;#160; The new impairment model requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur for most financial assets and certain other instruments.&amp;#160; It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods.&amp;#160; Early adoption for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018 is permitted.&amp;#160; Entities will apply the standard&amp;#8217;s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first effective reporting period.&amp;#160; We have not yet determined the impact that the new guidance will have on our results of operations
 financial position and cash flows and have not yet determined if we will early adopt the standard.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;In January 2017
 the FASB issued a new goodwill impairment standard that simplifies the goodwill impairment testing methodology.&amp;#160; The new standard eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test
 in which an entity determines the fair value at the test date of its assets and liabilities using the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.&amp;#160; It is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019.&amp;#160; Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1
 2017.&amp;#160; We will early adopt the standard as of January 1

 the FASB issued guidance which makes targeted amendments to current consolidation guidance.&amp;#160; Among other things
 the standard changes the manner in which we would assess one of the characteristics of variable interest entities (&amp;#8220;VIEs&amp;#8221;) and introduces a separate analysis specific to limited partnerships and similar entities (such as Nutra SA
 LLC) for assessing if the equity holders at risk lack decision making authority.&amp;#160; Limited partnerships and similar entities will be a VIE unless the limited partners hold substantive kick-out rights or participating rights.&amp;#160; A right to liquidate an entity is akin to a kick-out right.&amp;#160; Guidance for limited partnerships under the voting model has been eliminated.&amp;#160; A limited partner and similar partners with a controlling financial interest obtained through substantive kick-out rights would consolidate a limited partnership or similar entity.&amp;#160; Upon adoption in the first quarter of 2016
 there was no impact on our financial position or results of operations.&amp;#160; Specifically
 under the new guidance
 we continue to be the primary beneficiary of Nutra SA
 LLC.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-align: justify;&gt;In August 2014
 the FASB issued guidance which requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements.&amp;#160; Certain disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt about an entity&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern&amp;#160; The guidance applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15
 2016
 and interim periods thereafter
 with early adoption permitted.&amp;#160; We adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2016

GOING CONCERN
 MANAGEMENT PLANS AND GENERAL BUSINESS [Abstract]




GOING CONCERN
 MANAGEMENT PLANS AND GENERAL BUSINESS
NOTE 1. GOING CONCERN
We continued to experience losses and negative cash flows from operations throughout 2016
 resulting in accumulated deficit of $260 million&#160;which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of this filing.&#160; Despite these historical losses and negative cash flows
 management believes it has plans in place that will mitigate these historical conditions. Specifically
 we completed an $8 million debt and equity raise in February 2017
 as further described below. Consequently
 we believe that the USA segment is adequately funded at this time to allow us to operate and execute on our business strategy for achieving consistent and positive operational cash flows. We continue to believe that we will be able to obtain additional funds to operate our business
 should it be necessary; however
In May 2015
 the USA segment entered into an $8 million senior secured credit facility agreement with a lender (the &#8220;Lender&#8221;) consisting of a $3.5 million revolving loan
 not to exceed a borrowing base
 as defined in the agreement
 and an initial $2.5 million term loan.&#160; As a result of the credit facility transaction
 the notes for a majority of the subordinated note holders representing approximately 97% of the principal due were amended
 resulting in a $1.9 million loss on extinguishment.&#160; In February 2016
 we issued and sold preferred stock and warrants that netted proceeds of $2.6 million.&#160; In March 2016
 the restricted cash previously held in a $1.9 million escrow account associated with the purchase of Irgovel (see Note 15) was released to us pursuant to a court order.&#160; We repaid $1.0 million of the term loan with the Lender upon receipt of funds from the escrow account.&#160; In addition
In February 2017
 we issued and sold preferred stock and warrants that netted approximately $1.85 million after deducting fees and expenses related to the offering.&#160; Additionally
 in February 2017
 we entered into a securities purchase agreement whereby we sold and issued original issue discount senior secured debentures that netted approximately $5.6 million after expenses (together
 the &#8220;February 2017 Transactions
&#8221; see Note 20 for additional details on these February 2017 Transactions).&#160; Funds received from the February 2017 Transactions were used to repay amounts due to the Lender in full of approximately $3.8 million
The Brazil segment consists of the consolidated operations of Nutra SA
 LLC (&#8220;Nutra SA&#8221;)
 whose only operating subsidiary is Industria Riograndens De Oleos Vegetais Ltda. (&#8220;Irgovel&#8221;)
 located in Pelotas
 Brazil.&#160; Irgovel completed the final stages of a major capital expansion during the first quarter of 2015.&#160; Throughout 2014
 significant cash was used during the shutdown period and subsequent restart of the plant.&#160; In 2016
 2015 and 2014
 we invested $1.1 million
 $3.6 million and $10.3 million
 respectively
 in Nutra SA to fund completion of the capital project and Irgovel working capital needs. Under the terms of the February 2017 Transactions
Beginning in the second quarter of 2016 and through the fourth quarter of 2016
 the Brazil segment experienced severe cash shortages resulting in an increase in accounts payable (principally to raw bran suppliers) and accrued payroll related tax obligations as we delayed non-essential payments.&#160; The nonpayment of operating liabilities resulted in suppliers refusing to ship raw bran and other materials necessary to maintain steady operation of the plant.&#160; In addition to the Brazil segment working capital issues
 the funds necessary to meet scheduled debt payments no longer existed without additional equity funding. As a result
 the Brazil segment ceased making all bank debt payments in the second and third quarters of 2016.&#160; Discussions have ensued with the related banks with regard to renegotiation of existing debt agreements.&#160; However
 there is no assurance these discussions will be successful. In the second half of 2016
 our minority partner (the &#8220;Investors&#8221;) contributed $1.65 million to Irgovel and an additional $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.&#160; With this equity support
 Irgovel management has negotiated various raw bran supply agreements that will allow Irgovel to obtain rice bran on a consistent basis with set pricing. As a result
We are an ingredient company serving food
 animal nutrition and specialty markets focused on value-added processing and marketing of healthy
 natural and nutrient dense products derived from raw rice bran
 an underutilized by-product of the rice milling industry.&#160; We apply our proprietary and patented technologies and intellectual properties to convert raw rice bran into numerous high value products including stabilized rice bran (&#8220;SRB&#8221;)
 rice bran oil (&#8220;RBO&#8221;)
 defatted rice bran (&#8220;DRB&#8221;)
 RiBalance
 a complete rice bran nutritional package derived from further processing of SRB; RiSolubles
 a highly nutritious
 carbohydrate and lipid rich fraction of RiBalance; RiFiber
 a fiber rich insoluble derivative of RiBalance
 and ProRyza
 rice bran protein-based products
 and a variety of other valuable derivatives extracted from these core products.&#160; Our target markets are natural food
 functional food
 nutraceutical supplement and animal nutrition manufacturers
 wholesalers and retailers
We have two reportable operating segments: (i) USA segment
 which manufactures and distributes SRB (for food and animal nutrition customers) in various granulations along with Stage II products and derivatives and (ii) Brazil segment
 which extracts crude RBO and DRB from rice bran
 which are then further processed into fully refined rice bran oil for sale internationally and in Brazil
 compounded animal nutrition products for horses
 cows
 swine
 sheep and poultry and a number of valuable food and animal nutrition products derivatives and co-products. Stage II refers to the proprietary
 patented processes run at our Dillon
 Montana facility and includes products produced at that facility. In addition we incur corporate and other expenses not directly attributable to reportable operating segments
 which include costs related to our corporate staff
 general and administrative expenses including public company expenses
 intellectual property
 professional fees
 and other expenses.&#160; No corporate allocations
 including interest
The combined operations of our USA and Brazil segments encompass our approach to processing raw rice bran into various high quality
 value-added constituents and finished products.&#160; Over the past decade
 we have developed and optimized our proprietary processes to support the production of healthy
 natural
 hypoallergenic
 gluten free
 and non-genetically modified ingredients and supplements for use in meats
 baked goods
 cereals
 coatings
 health foods
 nutritional supplements
The USA segment produces SRB inside two supplier rice mills in California and our facility in Mermentau
 Louisiana.&#160; A facility located in Lake Charles
 Louisiana has been idle since May 2009.&#160; The USA segment also includes our Dillon
 Montana Stage II facility which produces our Stage II products: RiBalance
 a complete rice bran nutritional package derived from further processing of SRB; RiSolubles
 a highly nutritious
 carbohydrate and lipid rich fraction of RiBalance; RiFiber
 a fiber rich insoluble derivative of RiBalance
 and ProRyza
 rice bran protein-based products
 and a variety of other valuable derivatives extracted from these core products.&#160; The manufacturing facilities included in our USA segment have proprietary processing equipment and process patented technology for the stabilization and further processing of rice bran into finished products.&#160; In 2016
The Brazil segment consists of the consolidated operations of Nutra SA
 whose only operating subsidiary is Irgovel
 located in Pelotas
 Brazil.&#160; Irgovel manufactures RBO and DRB products for both the food ingredient and animal nutrition markets in Brazil and internationally.&#160; In refining RBO to an edible grade
 several co-products are obtained.&#160; One such product is distilled fatty acids
 a valuable raw material for the detergent industry.&#160; Irgovel also produces rice lecithin
 which has application in food ingredient products
 animal nutrition and industrial applications.&#160; DRB is compounded with a number of other ingredients to produce complex animal nutrition products which are packaged and sold under Irgovel brands in the Brazilian market
 sold as a raw material for further processing into food ingredient products or sold in bulk into the animal nutrition markets in Brazil and neighboring countries.&#160; In 2016
 approximately 58% of Brazil segment product revenue was from sales of RBO products and the remainder was from sales of DRB products.

 &#8211; The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in U.S. Dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities
 &#8211; The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.&#160; Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates
 &#8211; We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.&#160; As of December 31
 2016 and 2015
 &#8211; Accounts receivable represent amounts receivable on trade accounts.&#160; The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable.&#160; We analyze the aging of customer accounts
 customer concentrations
 customer credit-worthiness
 current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.&#160; From period to period
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value
 with cost determined by the first-in
 first-out method.&#160; In the USA segment
 we employ a full absorption procedure using standard cost techniques.&#160; The standards are customarily reviewed and adjusted annually so that they are materially consistent with actual purchase and production costs.&#160; In the Brazil segment
 we use actual average purchase and production costs.&#160; Provisions for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory are made based upon our analysis of inventory levels
We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.&#160; An impairment loss is recognized when the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset to be held and used are not sufficient to recover the unamortized balance of the asset.&#160; An impairment loss is recognized based on the difference between the carrying values and estimated fair value.&#160; The estimated fair value is determined based on either the discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods with the amount of any such deficiency charged to operations in the current year.&#160; Estimates of future cash flows are based on many factors
 including current operating results
 expected market trends and competitive influences.&#160; Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value
 &#8211; Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. We may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case
 it is necessary to perform a quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test. Otherwise
 the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. The quantitative two-step goodwill impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value. The Company has two reporting units
 which are the same as our operating segments. Multiple valuation techniques can be used to assess the fair value of the reporting unit. All of these techniques include the use of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or goodwill impairment
We regularly perform reviews to determine if facts and circumstances exist which indicate that the useful lives of our intangible assets are shorter than originally estimated or the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset to be held and used are not sufficient to recover the unamortized balance of the asset.&#160; An impairment loss is recognized based on the difference between the carrying values and estimated fair value.&#160; The estimated fair value is determined based on either the discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods with the amount of any such deficiency charged to operations in the current year.&#160; Estimates of future cash flows are based on many factors
 including current operating results
 &#8211; We recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss pass to our customers
 generally upon shipment for USA segment customers and Brazil segment international customers and upon customer receipt for Brazil segment domestic customers.&#160; Each transaction is evaluated to determine if all of the following four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred; (iii) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.&#160; If any of the above criteria cannot be satisfied then such a transaction is not recorded as revenue
We make provisions for estimated returns
 discounts and price adjustments when they are reasonably estimable.&#160; Revenues on the statements of operations are net of provisions for estimated returns
 routine sales discounts
Selling

 general and administrative expenses include salaries and wages
 bonuses and incentives
 stock-based compensation expense
 employee-related expenses
 facility-related expenses
 marketing and advertising expense
 depreciation of non-operating property and equipment
 professional fees
 amortization of intangible assets
Share-based compensation expense for stock options granted to employees is calculated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model based on awards ultimately expected to vest
 reduced for estimated forfeitures
 and expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period of the grant.&#160; Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on our historical forfeiture experience and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.&#160; Beginning in 2017
 we will recognize forfeitures as they occur rather than recording an estimated amount.&#160; This will not materially impact our financial statements.&#160; The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model requires us to estimate key assumptions such as expected life
 volatility
 risk-free interest rates and dividend yield to determine the fair value of share-based awards
For restricted stock awards (&#8220;RSAs&#8221;)
We account for share-based compensation awards granted to non-employees and consultants by determining the fair value of the awards granted at either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued
 whichever is more reliably measured.&#160; Generally we value stock options granted to non-employees and consultants using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model and RSAs at fair value.&#160; If the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used
 it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached or (ii) the date at which the counterparty&#8217;s performance is complete.&#160; The expense associated with stock awards issued to consultants or other third parties are recognized over the term of service.&#160; In the event services are terminated early or we require no specific future performance
 &#8211; The Investors may elect
 until January 1
 2018
 to exchange units in Nutra SA for our common stock (the &#8220;Exchange Right&#8221;).&#160; The appraised fair value of the Investors&#8217; interest in Nutra SA and the market price of our stock would be used to determine the amount of ownership interest the Investors would receive.&#160; The number of common shares and warrants issuable if the Investors elect the Exchange Right is variable and indeterminate.&#160; For accounting purposes
 we are not able to conclude that we have sufficient authorized and unissued shares to settle all contracts subject to the GAAP derivative guidance.&#160; Our adopted sequencing approach is based on earliest issuance date (the &#8220;Share Sequencing&#8221;)
 therefore we are required to record certain warrants issued after the right was granted to the Investors in June 2015 at fair value
 as derivative warrant liabilities.&#160; For the same reason
 the Series F Preferred Stock
 which is convertible to shares of our common stock
 We have certain warrant agreements in effect that contain anti-dilution clauses.&#160; Under these clauses
 we may be required to lower the exercise price on these warrants and issue additional warrants based on future issuances of our common stock and awards of stock options to employees
 additional issuance of warrants and/or other convertible instruments below certain exercise prices.&#160; We account for the warrants with these anti-dilution clauses as liability instruments.&#160; These warrants are valued using the lattice model in each reporting period and the resultant change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in other income (expense).&#160; Additional warrants are recorded as liability instruments due to the Share Sequencing
 &#8211; We use the U.S. Dollar as our reporting currency.&#160; The functional currency for Irgovel is the Brazilian Real.&#160; Assets and liabilities of Irgovel are translated using the exchange rate in effect at the consolidated balance sheet date.&#160; Equity accounts are translated at historical rates
 except for the change in accumulated deficit during the year
 which is the result of the income statement translation process.&#160; Irgovel&#8217;s revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates in effect during the period.&#160; Translation differences are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as foreign currency translation.&#160; Gains or losses on transactions denominated in a currency other than Irgovel&#8217;s functional currency which arise as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates are recorded as foreign exchange gain or loss in the statements of operations. The Brazilian Real exchange rates to the U.S. Dollar at December 31
 2014
 2015 and 2016 were 0.3758
 0.2523 and 0.3069
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.&#160; Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.&#160; A valuation allowance is established
 when necessary
 to reduce that deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.&#160; The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in Brazil.&#160; Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties
 the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that may be different from current estimates of the tax liabilities.&#160; If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment
 an additional charge to expense would result.&#160; If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts
In May 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and develop a common revenue standard for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.&#160; Under the new guidance
 an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services
 applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.&#160; An entity may choose to adopt the new standard either retrospectively or through a cumulative effect adjustment as of the start of the first period for which it applies the new standard.&#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2018
 however
 early adoption is permitted.&#160; We have begun to evaluate the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements but have not completed the evaluation and implementation process. We have not yet selected a transition method but have determined that we will utilize the deferred effective date of January 1
In February 2016
 the FASB issued guidance which changes the accounting for leases.&#160; Under prior GAAP
 the recognition
 measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease for us as a lessee depend primarily on the lease&#8217;s classification as a finance or operating lease.&#160; For both types of leases
 lessees will recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.&#160; For capital or finance leases
 lessees will recognize amortization of the right-of-use asset separately from interest expense on the lease liability.&#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2019 and must be adopted on a modified retrospective approach.&#160; Early adoption is allowed.&#160; We have not yet determined the impact that the new guidance will have on our results of operations
In March 2016
 the FASB issued new guidance that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees.&#160; The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled.&#160; In addition
 cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows.&#160; The guidance also allows us to repurchase more of an employee&#8217;s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting
 clarifies that all cash payments made on an employee&#8217;s behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on our cash flows statement
 and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur.&#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2017 with early adoption permitted.&#160; We plan to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2017 and change our accounting policy to recognize forfeitures as they occur.&#160; This change will not have a material effect on our results of operations as we currently do not apply an estimated forfeiture rate to restricted stock awards to our officers and directors.&#160; Additionally
 most of our outstanding stock option awards vest on a monthly basis over the vesting period (generally three or four years).&#160; As these awards do not have performance conditions
In June 2016
 the FASB issued a new credit loss standard that replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP.&#160; The new impairment model requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur for most financial assets and certain other instruments.&#160; It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods.&#160; Early adoption for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018 is permitted.&#160; Entities will apply the standard&#8217;s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first effective reporting period.&#160; We have not yet determined the impact that the new guidance will have on our results of operations
In January 2017
 the FASB issued a new goodwill impairment standard that simplifies the goodwill impairment testing methodology.&#160; The new standard eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test
 in which an entity determines the fair value at the test date of its assets and liabilities using the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.&#160; It is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019.&#160; Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1
 2017.&#160; We will early adopt the standard as of January 1
In February 2015
 the FASB issued guidance which makes targeted amendments to current consolidation guidance.&#160; Among other things
 the standard changes the manner in which we would assess one of the characteristics of variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;) and introduces a separate analysis specific to limited partnerships and similar entities (such as Nutra SA
 LLC) for assessing if the equity holders at risk lack decision making authority.&#160; Limited partnerships and similar entities will be a VIE unless the limited partners hold substantive kick-out rights or participating rights.&#160; A right to liquidate an entity is akin to a kick-out right.&#160; Guidance for limited partnerships under the voting model has been eliminated.&#160; A limited partner and similar partners with a controlling financial interest obtained through substantive kick-out rights would consolidate a limited partnership or similar entity.&#160; Upon adoption in the first quarter of 2016
 there was no impact on our financial position or results of operations.&#160; Specifically
 under the new guidance
 we continue to be the primary beneficiary of Nutra SA
In August 2014
 the FASB issued guidance which requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements.&#160; Certain disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt about an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern&#160; The guidance applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15
 2016
 and interim periods thereafter
 with early adoption permitted.&#160; We adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2016
 and it did not have a material effect on our results of operations.

We hold a variable interest which relates to our equity interest in Nutra SA (see Note 1).&#160; In December 2010
 we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement (&#8220;MIPA&#8221;) with AF Bran Holdings-NL LLC and AF Bran Holdings LLC (the &#8220;Investors&#8221;).&#160; The Investors&#8217; share of Nutra SA&#8217;s net income (loss) increases (decreases) redeemable noncontrolling interest.&#160; Our variable interest in Nutra SA is our Brazil segment.&#160; We are the primary beneficiary of Nutra SA
 and as such
 Nutra SA&#8217;s assets
 liabilities and results of operations are included in our consolidated financial statements.&#160; The Investors&#8217; interests are reflected in net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in Nutra SA in the consolidated statements of operations and redeemable noncontrolling interest in Nutra SA in the consolidated balance sheets.&#160; Due to the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of 2016 combined with continuing operating losses
 the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interest reflects a deficit balance beginning in the second quarter of 2016.&#160; This deficit balance is reflected in the total (deficit) equity attributable to RiceBran Technologies shareholders section of our consolidated balance sheet at December 31

 2016 (see Note 9)
 Nutra SA redeemed a certain number of units held by us equal to $1.7 million

Redeemable noncontrolling interest in Nutra SA
The Investors have drag along rights which provide the Investors the ability to force a sale of Nutra SA assets after January 1
 2018. The right terminates upon the occurrence of certain events (a $50 million Nutra SA initial public offering or a change of control
 as defined in the LLC Agreement).&#160; We may elect to exercise a right of first refusal to purchase the Investors&#8217; interest instead of proceeding to a sale.&#160; We have assessed the likelihood of the Investors exercising these rights as less than probable at December 31
The Investors may elect
 until January 1
 2018
 to exercise their Exchange Right.&#160; The appraised fair value of the Investors&#8217; interest in Nutra SA and the market price of our stock would be used to determine the amount of ownership interest the Investors would receive.&#160; The shares issued to the Investors may not exceed 49% of our outstanding common stock after such issuance; however
 if this limitation applies
 we would be required to issue to the Investors a warrant to purchase a number of shares of our common stock that
 when combined with the shares of common stock issued to the Investors
Under the original LLC Agreement
 as amended
 any units held by the Investors beginning January 1
 2014
 accrued a yield at 4% (&#8220;Yield&#8221;).&#160; The LLC Agreement was further amended in August 2015 to eliminate the Yield

Several economic factors occurred during the second quarter of 2016
 specifically related to our Brazil segment
 including a decline in raw bran availability and continuing operating losses resulting in a lack of working capital.&#160; Due to the lack of working capital
 the Brazil segment ceased making all bank debt payments in the second quarter of 2016.&#160; These events resulted in the need to perform an interim impairment test of our goodwill as of June 30
 2016
 which resulted in an estimated goodwill write-down of $3.0 million in the second quarter of 2016
 which was recorded in our Brazil segment. In the third quarter of 2016
 we completed the two-step goodwill impairment assessment to determine if any adjustment to the goodwill impairment charge was required.&#160; Based on the assessment
We performed a qualitative test of goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2016.&#160; The results of the impairment test indicated that the fair value of our USA segment related goodwill was in excess of the carrying value
 and thus was not impaired.

In May 2015
 we entered into an $8 million senior secured credit facility agreement with a lender (the &#8220;Lender&#8221;) consisting of a $3.5 million revolving loan
 not to exceed a borrowing base
 as defined in the agreement
 and an initial $2.5 million term loan
 which term loan may be increased at the Lender&#8217;s discretion by up to $2.0 million within 2 years.&#160; The funds were used for general corporate purposes and to provide working capital to facilitate future growth.&#160; The facility is secured by a senior interest in substantially all of our assets
 excluding half of our interest in Nutra SA and RBT PRO
 LLC.&#160; The credit facility matures on June 1
 2018
 with the potential for two one-year maturity extensions.&#160; The loan bears interest at a variable interest rate based on LIBOR
 with a 0.75% floor and 1.25% cap
 plus 10.75% per annum
 (11.5% at December 31
 a warrant to purchase 300
000 shares of common stock (exercise price of $5.25
 May 2020 expiration) to the Lender (see Note 11 for additional information related to the repricing of this warrant).&#160; As of December 31
 2016
 the fair value of the warrant is $0.1 million.&#160; As of December 31
 2016
 the remaining unamortized discount on the term note is $0.3 million.&#160; As of December 31
 2016
The May 2015 agreement with the Lender included certain financial and non-financial covenants such as a requirement that we maintain $2.0 million of total liquidity at all times which is defined as $1.0 million in cash on hand and $1.0 million of available borrowings.&#160; In February 2016
 we entered into an agreement with the Lender which modified the financial covenants to require that (a) from February 1
 2016 to July 15
 2016
 we maintain cash on hand
 including availability under our revolving loan with the Lender
 of not less than $1.5 million provided that at least $0.8 million of such amount must be in the form of cash on hand
 and (b) we maintain an average monthly adjusted EBITDA
 as defined by the agreement
 calculated over each consecutive three-month period beginning on January 1
&#160; February 1
 March 1
 April 1 and May 1
 2016
 of not less than $0.1 million.&#160; The Lender also waived
 for the first two quarters of 2016
 any non-compliance with the financial covenants in the May 2015 agreement.&#160; The amendment with the Lender requires that we repay $1.0 million of the senior term note which occurred on March 24
 2016.&#160; In consideration for the amendments
In June 2016 and September 2016
 we amended our agreements with the Lender to extend the prior modification of the loan agreement to December 31
 2016&#160; The amendments required that we maintain cash on hand
 including availability under our revolving loan with the Lender
 of not less than approximately $1.3 million

 which was added to the outstanding loan balance.&#160; The Lender also waived
 for the first three quarters of 2016
 any non-compliance with the financial covenants in the May 2015 agreement.&#160; In November 2016

 including availability under our revolving loan with the Lender
 of not less than approximately $1.0 million

See Note 20 for additional information related to 2017 debt refinancing transactions
In May 2015
 the terms of subordinated notes in the principal amount of $6.3 million were amended to extend the maturity dates from July 2016 to May 2018 and change the interest rate from 5% per year to an annual interest rate of LIBOR (as defined in the amendment) plus 11% (currently 11.75%) (the &#8220;Note Amendment&#8221;).&#160; Interest is payable quarterly.&#160; Principal was payable in seven quarterly installments of $0.3 million beginning in October 2016
 with the remainder of principal due in May 2018.&#160; The holders of these notes received warrants to acquire 289
670 shares of common stock in the aggregate (exercise price of $5.25
 May 2020 expiration).&#160; We accounted for the amendment as an extinguishment and reissuance.&#160; We recognized a $1.9 million loss on extinguishment equal to the total of (i) the difference between the $5.1 million carrying value of the notes on the date of the transaction and the $6.3 million face value of the notes and (ii) the $0.7 million fair value of the warrants at issuance.&#160; These notes are secured by a subordinated interest in substantially all of our assets
 excluding our interest in Nutra SA and RBT PRO
See Note 20 for additional information related to 2017 debt refinancing transactions
As of December 31
 2016
 Brazil had approximately $0.5 million (USD) of installment loans in arrears.&#160; The banks have not called these loans in default
 and management continues to work with the lenders to renegotiate payment terms
 however
 all Brazil segment debt has been classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31
 2016.&#160; All Brazil segment debt is denominated in the Brazilian Real (R$)
In December 2011
 Irgovel entered into loan agreements with the Bank of Brazil.&#160; As of December 31
 2016
 the remaining notes held a principal balance of R$8.0 million. The annual interest rate on the loans is 6.5%
 payable quarterly and the loans mature December 2021.&#160; Irgovel must make monthly principal payments under each of the loans.&#160; In July 2012
Irgovel has working capital lines of credit secured by accounts receivable.&#160; The total amount of borrowing cannot exceed 40%-100% of the collateral
 depending on the agreement.&#160; The annual interest rates on this debt range from 8.4% to 34.8%
Irgovel has an unsecured note payable for Brazilian federal and social security taxes under special government tax programs.&#160; Principal and interest payments are due monthly through January 2029.&#160; Interest on the notes is payable monthly at the Brazilian SELIC target rate
 which was 13.8% at December 31
As of December 31
 2016
 we are in compliance with the provisions and financial covenants associated with our debt agreements
 as modified and discussed above.

 our board of directors authorized the issuance of 3

000
000 shares of our common stock at the holder&#8217;s election at any time
 subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations
 at a ratio of 1 preferred share for 666.66666 shares of common stock.&#160; The Series F Preferred Stock is only entitled to receive dividends if we declare dividends
 in which case the dividend will be paid (i) first an amount equal to $0.01 per share of preferred stock and (ii) then to and in the same form as dividends paid on shares of our common stock.&#160; Otherwise
In February 2016
 in conjunction with the sale of the Series F Preferred Stock
 we also sold warrants to purchase 2
660
000 shares of common stock (exercise price of $2.00 per share
 exercisable beginning in August 2016 and expiring in August 2021).&#160; The placement agent for the offering received a cash fee of $0.2 million.&#160; The net proceeds from the offering were $2.6 million
 after deducting placement agent discounts
 commissions and other cash offering expenses of $0.4 million.&#160; On the date of issuance
 we allocated $2.5 million of the $3.0 million gross proceeds to derivative warrant liability
 to record the warrants at fair value and recorded the remaining $0.5 million proceeds as preferred stock.&#160; We recorded a dividend on preferred stock for the preferred stock beneficial conversion feature equal to the proceeds allocated to the preferred stock at issuance ($0.5 million)
 as the fair value of the common stock underlying the convertible preferred stock at issuance was $2.7 million.&#160; As a result of this offering
 the exercise price of certain warrants that contain full ratchet anti-dilution provisions was reduced from $5.24 per share to $1.50 per share and the number of shares of common stock underlying these warrants increased from 426

 we repriced a previously issued warrant held by the Lender from $5.25 per share to $1.85 per share. In September 2016
 we entered into an additional amendment agreement with our Lender to extend the prior modification of the loan agreement.&#160; In connection with this amendment

Due to offerings and conversions that occurred in 2013 and 2014
 we believe our ability to utilize previously accumulated net operating loss carryforwards are subject to substantial annual limitations due to &#8220;change in ownership&#8221; provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986

 and similar state regulations.&#160; Therefore in 2014
 we recorded the impact of the expiration of substantial net operating loss carryforwards prior to utilization.&#160; We have not yet completed a formal analysis to determine the exact amount of such limitation
 therefore
We are subject to taxation in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and local and non-U.S. jurisdictions.&#160; We record liabilities for income tax contingencies based on our best estimate of the underlying exposures.&#160; We are open for audit by the IRS for years after 2012 and

In the normal course of business
 we periodically enter into employment agreements which incorporate indemnification provisions.&#160; While the maximum amount to which we may be exposed under such agreements cannot be reasonably estimated
 we maintain insurance coverage
We have employment contracts with certain officers and key management that include provisions for potential severance payments in the event of without-cause terminations or terminations under certain circumstances after a change in control. In addition
Future minimum payments under these commitments as of December 31

Years Ending December 31

In addition to the matters discussed below
 from time to time we are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business in the USA and Brazil.&#160; These matters may relate to employment and labor claims
 patent and intellectual property claims
 claims of alleged non-compliance with contract provisions and claims related to alleged violations of laws and regulations.&#160; When applicable
 we record accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.&#160; While the outcome of lawsuits and other proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty
 in the opinion of management
 individually or in the aggregate
On August 28
 2008
 former Irgovel stockholder David Resyng filed an indemnification suit against Irgovel
 Osmar Brito and the remaining former Irgovel stockholders (&#8220;Sellers&#8221;)
 requesting:&#160; (i) the freezing of the escrow account maintained in connection with the transfer of Irgovel&#8217;s corporate control to us and the presentation of all documentation related to the transaction
 and (ii) damages in the amount of the difference between (a) the sum received by David Resyng in connection with the judicial settlement agreement executed in the action for the partial dissolution of the limited liability company filed by David Resyng against Irgovel and the Sellers and (b) the amount received by the Sellers in connection with the sale of Irgovel&#8217;s corporate control to us
We believe that the filing of the above lawsuit is a fundamental default of the obligations undertaken by the Sellers under the quotas purchase agreement for the transfer of Irgovel&#8217;s corporate control
 executed by and among the Sellers and us on January 31
 2008 (&#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;).&#160; Consequently
 we believe that the responsibility for any indemnity
On February 6
 2009
 the Sellers filed a collection lawsuit against us seeking payment of the second installment of the purchase price under the Purchase Agreement
 which the Sellers assert is approximately $1.0 million.&#160; We have withheld payment of the second installment pending resolution of the Resyng lawsuit noted above.&#160; RiceBran Technologies
 the parent company
 has not been served with any formal notices in regard to this matter.&#160; To date
 only Irgovel has received formal legal notice.&#160; In addition
 the Purchase Agreement requires that all disputes between us and the Sellers be adjudicated through arbitration.&#160; In 2015
As part of the Purchase Agreement
 $2.0 million was deposited into an escrow account to cover contingencies with the net remaining funds payable to the Sellers upon resolution of all contingencies.&#160; As of December 31
 2015
 the balance in the escrow account was $1.9 million and was included in restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet.&#160; On January 12
 2016
 the US District Court for the District of Arizona entered a final judgment in our favor affirming the arbitration award received in Brazil.&#160; On March 24
 2016
 the $1.9 million in the escrow account was released to us to fund the award owed to us by the Sellers and
 as required under an agreement with the Lender
With regard to the request for freezing the escrow funds noted above
 the Brazilian court ordered Irgovel not to access those funds under the premise that the Sellers may have a right to those funds as originally contemplated in the Purchase Agreement.&#160; A fine of R$10
000 per day for violating that order was established by the court.&#160; From the escrow release date of March 24
 2016 through today
 no fine has been imposed.&#160; We believe that with the final judgment in our favor
 the Sellers no longer have any possible legal claim on the escrow funds and
 thus
We believe that there are no significant remaining contingencies.&#160; We recognized a gain of $1.6 million in 2016
Irgovel is defendant in several labor claims
 mainly related to overtime
 illnesses allegedly contracted at work and work-related injuries and salary related matters for periods prior to the acquisition of Irgovel by RiceBran. The labor suits are mainly in the lower courts
 and for the majority of the cases a decision for the dismissal of the claims has been granted. None of these labor claims is individually significant.&#160; Management believes it&#8217;s unlikely there will be a judgment against Irgovel
 however
 in the event the court does issue a judgment against Irgovel
 it could be approximately $900
Irgovel accrues for losses on tax and other legal contingencies when it has a present obligation
 formalized or not
 as a result of a past event
 it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Irgovel is a party to other several pending litigations and administrative proceedings at the Federal
 State and Municipal level. The assessment of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in these litigations and proceedings includes the analysis of the evidence available
 the hierarchy of the applicable laws
 available former court decisions
 as well as the most recent court decisions and their importance to the Brazilian legal system
As further described in Note 4
 Irgovel is required to meet minimum annual processing targets or to achieve EBITDA on a local currency basis of at least R$4.0 million annually. If not achieved
 this would result in an event of default.&#160; It is possible that an event of default may be triggered and a waiver of non-compliance may not be obtained from the Investors. At December 31
 2016
We have employment contracts with certain officers and key management that include provisions for potential severance payments in the event of without-cause terminations or terminations under certain circumstances after a change in control. In addition
 vesting of outstanding nonvested equity grants would accelerate following a change in control. See Note 9 for severance information related to our former chief executive officer.

 2017
 we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain accredited investors
 pursuant to which we sold and issued: (i) an aggregate of 2
000 shares of Convertible Series G Preferred Stock (&#8220;Series G Preferred Stock&#8221;) with a stated value equal to $1
000 per share and (ii) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1
423
488 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.96 per share (&#8220;Preferred Warrants&#8221;) which such Series G Preferred Stock and Preferred Warrants become convertible or exercisable
 as applicable
 immediately upon the Company&#8217;s filing with the State of California of an amendment to its articles of incorporation (the &#8220;Amendment&#8221;) to increase the number of its authorized shares of common stock to 50
000
000 shares from 25
000
000 shares of common stock&#160; (the &#8220;Preferred Stock Private Placement&#8221;). The closing of the Preferred Stock Private Placement took place on February 13
We received aggregate net proceeds
 after deducting placement agent fees and other estimated expenses related to the Preferred Stock Private Placement
 in the amount of approximately $1.85 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital
The Preferred Stock is non-voting and is convertible at the holder&#8217;s election at any time
 at a ratio of 1 preferred share for 948.9915 shares of common stock.&#160; The Series G Preferred Stock is only entitled to receive dividends if any are declared by the Company
 in which case the dividend will be paid (a) first an amount equal to $0.01 per share of Series G Preferred Stock (before any distributions or payments to junior securities)
Each Preferred Warrant will be exercisable beginning on the Authorized Share Increase Date (the &#8220;Initial Exercise Date&#8221; or February 15
 2017) at an exercise price of $0.96 per share
 subject to adjustment as provided therein. The Preferred Warrants will be exercisable for five years from the Initial Exercise Date

The closing of the Debenture Private Placement took place on February 13
 2017.&#160; The Aggregate Principal Amount of the Debentures shall be due and payable on February 13
 2019. The Debentures Purchase Agreement contains customary representations
We received aggregate net proceeds
 after deducting placement agent fees and other estimated expenses related to the Debenture Private Placement
 in the amount of approximately $5.6 million. We used the net proceeds from this offering to (i) pay off the debt of approximately $3.8 million held by the Lender
 (ii) pay down the principal and interest due on subordinated notes held by certain subordinated creditors totaling $0.5 million
The Debentures Purchase Agreement also provides for the repricing of 875
000 existing warrants held by Purchasers which currently have an exercise price of $5.87
 $5.27 and $5.25. The Company agreed to: (i) reduce the exercise price to $0.96
 provided that such warrants shall not be exercisable for 6 months and a day from the date such exercise price is reduced
 and (ii) amend the termination dates on such existing warrants to be August 10
 2022. The number of existing warrants being repriced is based on each Purchaser&#8217;s subscription amount of the Debentures
 and shall not exceed 125 Warrant Shares for each $1
In connection with the Debenture Private Placement
 the Company and its subsidiaries entered into a Security Agreement with the Debenture Purchasers dated as of February 13

 2017 (&#8220;Debenture Resale Registration Statement&#8221;).&#160; If the Debenture Resale Registration Statement is not declared effective by May 13
 2017 (or June 13
 2017 if a full SEC review occurs) then we will have to pay certain liquidated damages of 2% multiplied by the aggregate exercise price of the warrants each month

 &#8211; The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in U.S. Dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities
 disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses.&#160; Actual results may differ from those estimates.&#160; The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of RiceBran Technologies and all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest.&#160; Variable interest in subsidiaries for which we are the primary beneficiary are consolidated.&#160; All significant inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.&#160; Noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries are recorded net of tax as net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.




 &#8211; The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.&#160; Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates
 actual results could differ from those estimates.&#160;&#160; 




 &#8211; We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.&#160; As of December 31
 2016 and 2015
 we maintained our cash and cash equivalents with major banks.&#160; We maintain cash in bank accounts in amounts which at times may exceed federally insured limits.&#160; We have not experienced any losses on such accounts.




 &#8211; Accounts receivable represent amounts receivable on trade accounts.&#160; The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable.&#160; We analyze the aging of customer accounts
 customer concentrations
 customer credit-worthiness
 current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.&#160; From period to period
 differences in judgments or estimates utilized may result in material differences in the amount and timing of the provision for doubtful accounts.&#160; We periodically evaluate our credit policy to ensure that the customers are worthy of terms and support our business plans.




Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value
 with cost determined by the first-in
 first-out method.&#160; In the USA segment
 we employ a full absorption procedure using standard cost techniques.&#160; The standards are customarily reviewed and adjusted annually so that they are materially consistent with actual purchase and production costs.&#160; In the Brazil segment
 we use actual average purchase and production costs.&#160; Provisions for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory are made based upon our analysis of inventory levels
 historical obsolescence and future sales forecasts; while inventory determined to be obsolete is written off immediately.




We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.&#160; An impairment loss is recognized when the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset to be held and used are not sufficient to recover the unamortized balance of the asset.&#160; An impairment loss is recognized based on the difference between the carrying values and estimated fair value.&#160; The estimated fair value is determined based on either the discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods with the amount of any such deficiency charged to operations in the current year.&#160; Estimates of future cash flows are based on many factors
 including current operating results
 expected market trends and competitive influences.&#160; Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value
 less estimated costs to sell.




 &#8211; Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. We may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case
 it is necessary to perform a quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test. Otherwise
 the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. The quantitative two-step goodwill impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value. The Company has two reporting units
 which are the same as our operating segments. Multiple valuation techniques can be used to assess the fair value of the reporting unit. All of these techniques include the use of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or goodwill impairment
 or both.




We regularly perform reviews to determine if facts and circumstances exist which indicate that the useful lives of our intangible assets are shorter than originally estimated or the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset to be held and used are not sufficient to recover the unamortized balance of the asset.&#160; An impairment loss is recognized based on the difference between the carrying values and estimated fair value.&#160; The estimated fair value is determined based on either the discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods with the amount of any such deficiency charged to operations in the current year.&#160; Estimates of future cash flows are based on many factors
 including current operating results
 expected market trends and competitive influences.&#160; We also evaluate the amortization periods assigned to its intangible assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives.




 &#8211; We recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss pass to our customers
 generally upon shipment for USA segment customers and Brazil segment international customers and upon customer receipt for Brazil segment domestic customers.&#160; Each transaction is evaluated to determine if all of the following four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred; (iii) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.&#160; If any of the above criteria cannot be satisfied then such a transaction is not recorded as revenue
We make provisions for estimated returns
 discounts and price adjustments when they are reasonably estimable.&#160; Revenues on the statements of operations are net of provisions for estimated returns
 routine sales discounts
 volume allowances and adjustments.&#160; Revenues on the statements of operations are also net of taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.



Selling
 General and Administrative Expenses
Selling

 general and administrative expenses include salaries and wages
 bonuses and incentives
 stock-based compensation expense
 employee-related expenses
 facility-related expenses
 marketing and advertising expense
 depreciation of non-operating property and equipment
 professional fees
 amortization of intangible assets
 provisions for losses on accounts receivable and other operating expenses.









Share-based compensation expense for stock options granted to employees is calculated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model based on awards ultimately expected to vest
 reduced for estimated forfeitures
 and expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period of the grant.&#160; Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on our historical forfeiture experience and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.&#160; Beginning in 2017
 we will recognize forfeitures as they occur rather than recording an estimated amount.&#160; This will not materially impact our financial statements.&#160; The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model requires us to estimate key assumptions such as expected life
 volatility
 risk-free interest rates and dividend yield to determine the fair value of share-based awards
For restricted stock awards (&#8220;RSAs&#8221;)
We account for share-based compensation awards granted to non-employees and consultants by determining the fair value of the awards granted at either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued
 whichever is more reliably measured.&#160; Generally we value stock options granted to non-employees and consultants using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model and RSAs at fair value.&#160; If the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used
 it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached or (ii) the date at which the counterparty&#8217;s performance is complete.&#160; The expense associated with stock awards issued to consultants or other third parties are recognized over the term of service.&#160; In the event services are terminated early or we require no specific future performance
 the entire amount is expensed.&#160; The value is re-measured each reporting period over the requisite service period.




 &#8211; The Investors may elect
 until January 1
 2018
 to exchange units in Nutra SA for our common stock (the &#8220;Exchange Right&#8221;).&#160; The appraised fair value of the Investors&#8217; interest in Nutra SA and the market price of our stock would be used to determine the amount of ownership interest the Investors would receive.&#160; The number of common shares and warrants issuable if the Investors elect the Exchange Right is variable and indeterminate.&#160; For accounting purposes
 we are not able to conclude that we have sufficient authorized and unissued shares to settle all contracts subject to the GAAP derivative guidance.&#160; Our adopted sequencing approach is based on earliest issuance date (the &#8220;Share Sequencing&#8221;)
 therefore we are required to record certain warrants issued after the right was granted to the Investors in June 2015 at fair value
 as derivative warrant liabilities.&#160; For the same reason
 the Series F Preferred Stock
 which is convertible to shares of our common stock
 has been recorded in temporary equity on our consolidated balance sheet.




 We have certain warrant agreements in effect that contain anti-dilution clauses.&#160; Under these clauses
 we may be required to lower the exercise price on these warrants and issue additional warrants based on future issuances of our common stock and awards of stock options to employees
 additional issuance of warrants and/or other convertible instruments below certain exercise prices.&#160; We account for the warrants with these anti-dilution clauses as liability instruments.&#160; These warrants are valued using the lattice model in each reporting period and the resultant change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in other income (expense).&#160; Additional warrants are recorded as liability instruments due to the Share Sequencing
 as disclosed above.




 &#8211; We use the U.S. Dollar as our reporting currency.&#160; The functional currency for Irgovel is the Brazilian Real.&#160; Assets and liabilities of Irgovel are translated using the exchange rate in effect at the consolidated balance sheet date.&#160; Equity accounts are translated at historical rates
 except for the change in accumulated deficit during the year
 which is the result of the income statement translation process.&#160; Irgovel&#8217;s revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates in effect during the period.&#160; Translation differences are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as foreign currency translation.&#160; Gains or losses on transactions denominated in a currency other than Irgovel&#8217;s functional currency which arise as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates are recorded as foreign exchange gain or loss in the statements of operations. The Brazilian Real exchange rates to the U.S. Dollar at December 31
 2014
 2015 and 2016 were 0.3758
 0.2523 and 0.3069
 respectively.




Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.&#160; Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.&#160; A valuation allowance is established
 when necessary
 to reduce that deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.&#160; The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in Brazil.&#160; Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties
 the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that may be different from current estimates of the tax liabilities.&#160; If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment
 an additional charge to expense would result.&#160; If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts
 the reversal of the liabilities may result in income tax benefits being recognized in the period when it is determined that the liabilities are no longer necessary.




In May 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and develop a common revenue standard for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.&#160; Under the new guidance
 an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services
 applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.&#160; An entity may choose to adopt the new standard either retrospectively or through a cumulative effect adjustment as of the start of the first period for which it applies the new standard.&#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2018
 however
 early adoption is permitted.&#160; We have begun to evaluate the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements but have not completed the evaluation and implementation process. We have not yet selected a transition method but have determined that we will utilize the deferred effective date of January 1
In February 2016
 the FASB issued guidance which changes the accounting for leases.&#160; Under prior GAAP
 the recognition
 measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease for us as a lessee depend primarily on the lease&#8217;s classification as a finance or operating lease.&#160; For both types of leases
 lessees will recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.&#160; For capital or finance leases
 lessees will recognize amortization of the right-of-use asset separately from interest expense on the lease liability.&#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2019 and must be adopted on a modified retrospective approach.&#160; Early adoption is allowed.&#160; We have not yet determined the impact that the new guidance will have on our results of operations
In March 2016
 the FASB issued new guidance that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees.&#160; The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled.&#160; In addition
 cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows.&#160; The guidance also allows us to repurchase more of an employee&#8217;s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting
 clarifies that all cash payments made on an employee&#8217;s behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on our cash flows statement
 and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur.&#160; The guidance is effective for our annual and interim periods beginning in 2017 with early adoption permitted.&#160; We plan to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2017 and change our accounting policy to recognize forfeitures as they occur.&#160; This change will not have a material effect on our results of operations as we currently do not apply an estimated forfeiture rate to restricted stock awards to our officers and directors.&#160; Additionally
 most of our outstanding stock option awards vest on a monthly basis over the vesting period (generally three or four years).&#160; As these awards do not have performance conditions
In June 2016
 the FASB issued a new credit loss standard that replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP.&#160; The new impairment model requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur for most financial assets and certain other instruments.&#160; It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods.&#160; Early adoption for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018 is permitted.&#160; Entities will apply the standard&#8217;s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first effective reporting period.&#160; We have not yet determined the impact that the new guidance will have on our results of operations
In January 2017
 the FASB issued a new goodwill impairment standard that simplifies the goodwill impairment testing methodology.&#160; The new standard eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test
 in which an entity determines the fair value at the test date of its assets and liabilities using the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.&#160; It is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019.&#160; Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1
 2017.&#160; We will early adopt the standard as of January 1
In February 2015
 the FASB issued guidance which makes targeted amendments to current consolidation guidance.&#160; Among other things
 the standard changes the manner in which we would assess one of the characteristics of variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;) and introduces a separate analysis specific to limited partnerships and similar entities (such as Nutra SA
 LLC) for assessing if the equity holders at risk lack decision making authority.&#160; Limited partnerships and similar entities will be a VIE unless the limited partners hold substantive kick-out rights or participating rights.&#160; A right to liquidate an entity is akin to a kick-out right.&#160; Guidance for limited partnerships under the voting model has been eliminated.&#160; A limited partner and similar partners with a controlling financial interest obtained through substantive kick-out rights would consolidate a limited partnership or similar entity.&#160; Upon adoption in the first quarter of 2016
 there was no impact on our financial position or results of operations.&#160; Specifically
 under the new guidance
 we continue to be the primary beneficiary of Nutra SA
In August 2014
 the FASB issued guidance which requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements.&#160; Certain disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt about an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern&#160; The guidance applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15
 2016
 and interim periods thereafter
 with early adoption permitted.&#160; We adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2016
 and it did not have a material effect on our results of operations.







Disclosure of accounting purposes
 we are not able to conclude that we have sufficient authorized and unissued shares to settle all contracts subject to the GAAP derivative guidance. Our adopted sequencing approach is based on earliest issuance date (the Share Sequencing)

Tabular disclosure of warrants or rights issued. Warrants and rights outstanding are derivative securities that give the holder the right to purchase securities (usually equity) from the issuer at a specific price within a certain time frame. Warrants are often included in a new debt issue to entice investors by a higher return potential. The main difference between warrants and call options is that warrants are issued and guaranteed by the company
 whereas options are exchange instruments and are not issued by the company. Also
 the lifetime of a warrant is often measured in years
 while the lifetime of a typical option is measured in months. Disclose the title of issue of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the aggregate amount of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the date from which the warrants or rights are exercisable
 and the price at which the warrant or right is exercisable.

The estimated amount of dividends to be paid to holders of the underlying shares (expected dividends) over the option's term. Dividends are taken into account because payment of dividends to shareholders reduces the fair value of the underlying shares
 and option holders generally do not receive dividends.




























The estimated measure of the maximum percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean.
