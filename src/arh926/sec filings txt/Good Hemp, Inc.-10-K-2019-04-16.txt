Non-alcoholic beverages are among the most widely distributed food products in the world and are being sold through more than 400
000 retailers in the United States
 our core market. The United States has more than 2
600 beverage companies and 500 bottlers of beverage products. Collectively they account for more than $100 billion in annual sales. It is estimated that globally more than $300 billion worth of non-alcoholic beverages are sold annually. The beverage market is controlled by two giants
 The Coca-Cola Company (&#8220;Coke&#8221;) and PepsiCo
 combining for over 70% of the non-alcoholic beverage market. Carbonated beverage sales are slipping

Direct Store Delivery (&#8220;DSD&#8221; ) - DSD players
 and regional and local distributors touch over 90% of retail chains in the US. DSDs primarily distribute beverages
 chips
 snacks and milk and provide pre-sales
Direct to Retail Channel (&#8220;Warehouse Direct&#8221;) - We are targeting listings with large retail convenience store and grocery store chains where we ship direct to the chain stores warehousing system. Retailers must have warehousing and delivery capabilities. Services to retailers will be provided by an assigned broker
 approved by us
 to oversee pre-sale and merchandising services. Our direct to retail channel of distribution is an important part of our strategy to target large national or regional restaurant chains
 retail accounts
 including mass merchandisers and premier food-service businesses. Through these programs
 we will negotiate directly with the retailer to carry our products
Our strategy is to outsource the manufacturing and warehousing of our products to independent contract manufacturers (&#8220;co-packers&#8221;). We will purchase our raw materials from North American suppliers which deliver to our third-party co-packers. We will use two or more co-packers to manufacture and package our products. Once our products are manufactured
 we store finished product in a warehouse adjacent to each co-packer or in third party warehouses. Our copackers will be chosen based on their proximity to markets covered by our distributors. Most of the ingredients used in the formulation of our products are off-the shelf and thus readily available. No ingredient has a lead time greater than two weeks. Other than minimum case volume requirements per production run for most co-packers
 we will not have annual minimum production commitments with our co-packers. Our co-packers may terminate their arrangements with us at any time
Substantially all the raw materials used in the preparation
 bottling and packaging of our products will be purchased by us or by our contract manufacturers in accordance with our specifications. The raw materials used in the preparation and packaging of our products will consist primarily of juice concentrates
 natural flavors
 stevia
 pure cane sugar
 bottles
 labels
 trays and enclosures. These raw materials will be purchased from suppliers selected by us or by our contract manufacturers. We believe that we have adequate sources of raw materials
We will purchase our flavor concentrate from several flavor concentrate suppliers. Generally
 all natural flavor suppliers own the proprietary rights to the flavors. About the development of new products and flavors
 independent suppliers bear a large portion of the expense for product development
 thereby enabling us to develop new products and flavors at relatively low cost. We anticipate that for future flavors and additional products
 we may purchase flavor concentrate from other flavor houses with the intention of developing other sources of flavor concentrate for each of our products. If we must replace a flavor supplier
 we could experience disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers
Our product philosophy will continue to be based on developing products in those segments of the market that offer the greatest chance of success such as health
 wellness and natural refreshment and rehydration
 and we will continue to seek out underserved market niches. We believe we can quickly respond
 given our technical and marketing expertise
 to changing market conditions with new and innovative products. We are committed to developing products that are distinct
 meet a quantifiable need
 are proprietary
 lend themselves to at least a 30% gross profit
 project a quality and healthy image
We own the following intellectual property: - Good Hemp&#174; trademark
Our sales are expected to be seasonal and experience fluctuations in quarterly results because of many factors. Historically
 the industry experiences an increase in revenues during the warm weather months of April through September. Timing of customer purchases will vary each year and sales can be expected to shift from one quarter to another. Thus
We are an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; as defined under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
 commonly referred to as the JOBS Act. We will remain an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; for up to five years
 or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion
 (ii) the date that we become a &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
As an &#8220;emerging growth company
&#8221; we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies&#8221; including
not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (we also will not be subject to the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) as long as we are a &#8220;smaller reporting company
In addition
 Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Under this provision
 an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. In other words
 an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can delay the adoption of such accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies until the first to occur of the date the subject company (i) is no longer an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period provided in Securities Act Section 7(a) (2) (B). The Company has elected to take advantage of this extended transition period and
 as a result
 our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies. Accordingly
 until the date that we are no longer an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; or affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the exemption provided by Securities Act Section 7(a) (2) (B)
 upon the issuance of a new or revised accounting standard that applies to your financial statements and has a different effective date for public and private companies

 or auditing scope or procedure
An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our Principal Executive and Financial Officers of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-K. Disclosure controls and procedures are procedures designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

 within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s rules and forms
 and that such information is accumulated and is communicated to our management
 including our Principal Executive and Financial Officers
 or persons performing similar functions
 as appropriate
 to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation
 our management concluded that

 that the objectives of the controls system are met
 and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission
 internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by
 or under the supervision of the company&#8217;s Principal Executive and Financial Officers and implemented by its Board of Directors
 management and other personnel
Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
The Company&#8217;s Principal Executive and Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2018
 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
Based on this evaluation
 management concluded that the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31
the Company did not maintain adequate segregation of duties related to job responsibilities for initiating
 authorizing
Notwithstanding the above
 a controls system cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met
 and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
Additionally
There was no change in the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements
 whether due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As described in Note 3 to the financial statements
 the Company has accumulated losses and no revenue

 formerly known as Keyser Resources
 Inc.
 was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 26
Shortly after September 30
 2013
 the Company ceased operation as it was in default of certain creditor obligations. In 2017
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the recoverability of long-lived assets and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts
 historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company&#8217;s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results
For purposes of the statement of cash flows
 cash equivalents include demand deposits

The FASB issued ASC 820-10
 
 for financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices
 such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active
 - The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness. At times
 its cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. The Company&#8217;s management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds
 and as such
The Company computes net income or loss per share in accordance with ASC 260 Earnings per Share. Under the provisions of the Earnings per Share Topic ASC
 basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted net loss per share gives effect to common stock equivalents; however
The Company accounts for its income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 Income Taxes

Lone
Star Gold
 Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Lone Star&#8221;)
 formerly known as Keyser Resources
 Inc.
 was incorporated
in the State of Nevada on November 26
 2007. The Company is an Exploration Stage Company as defined by Financial Accounting Standards
Board Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 915 

Shortly
after September 30
 2013
 the Company ceased operation as it was in default of certain creditor obligations. In 2017
 the Company
was put into receivership to satisfy those outstanding creditor claims. In 2018 the Company emerged from receivership and commenced
operations including bringing all necessary SEC filings up-to-date.



































The entire disclosure for the nature of an entity's business
 major products or services
 principal markets including location
 and the relative importance of its operations in each business and the basis for the determination
 including but not limited to
 assets
 revenues
 or earnings. For an entity that has not commenced principal operations

(a)
Basis of Presentation

These
financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States and are expressed in US dollars.

The
Company&#8217;s fiscal year-end is December 31.

(b)
Use of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company
regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the recoverability of long-lived assets and deferred income tax asset
valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts
 historical experience and various other
factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company&#8217;s estimates. To the extent
there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results
 future results of operations will be affected.

(c)
Cash and Cash Equivalents

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows
 cash equivalents include demand deposits
 money market funds
 and all highly liquid debt
instructions with original maturities of three months or less.

(d)
Financial Instruments

The
FASB issued ASC 820-10
 
 for financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 provides
a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. ASC 820-10 defines fair
value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal
or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 also establishes
a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
 where available. The following summarizes
the three levels of inputs required by the standard that the Company uses to measure fair value:



    
Level 1: Quoted
    prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

    
Level 2: Observable
    inputs other than Level 1 prices
 such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are
    not active
 or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full
    term of the related assets or liabilities.

    
Level 3: Unobservable
    inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

&#160;
&#160;
(e)
Concentrations and Credit Risk

The
Company does not have any financial asset and therefore is not exposed to any credit risks.

Cash

 its cash
and cash equivalents with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. The Company&#8217;s
management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds
 and as such
it believes that any associated credit risk exposures are limited.

(g)
Net Loss Per Common Share

The
Company computes net income or loss per share in accordance with ASC 260 Earnings per Share. Under the provisions of the Earnings
per Share Topic ASC
 basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders for the period
by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted net loss per
share gives effect to common stock equivalents; however
 potential common shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive.

(g)
Income Taxes

The
Company accounts for its income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 Income Taxes
 which requires recognition of deferred tax assets
and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations
in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that would
otherwise be recorded for income tax benefits primarily relating to operating loss carryforwards as realization cannot be determined
to be more likely than not.

The
statement establishes a more-likely-than-not threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements.
Also
 the statement implements a process for measuring those tax positions which meet the recognition threshold of being ultimately
sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. There are no uncertain tax positions taken by the Company on its tax returns
and the adoption of the statement had no material impact to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. The Company
files tax returns in the US and states in which it has operations and is subject to taxation. Tax years subsequent to 2013 remain
open to examination by U.S. federal and state tax jurisdictions.

(h)
Commitment and Contingencies

The
Company follows ASC 450-20
 
 to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies
arising from claims
 assessments
 litigation
 fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability
has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated.

(i)
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In
June 2018
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued ASU No. 2018-07
 Compensation &#8211; Stock Compensation
(Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting
 which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based
payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees except for certain circumstances. Any transition impact
will be a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. This ASU is effective
for the annual period beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within that annual period and early adoption
is permitted. We have adopted this guidance on January 1
 2019 and there is no material impact on our financial statements.
&#160;
&#160;
In
February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842)
 which will require organizations that lease assets to recognize
on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. Qualitative and quantitative
disclosures are required
 and optional practical expedients may be elected. This ASU is effective for the annual period beginning
after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within that annual period. Subsequent amendments to the initial guidance have
been issued in January 2017
 January 2018
 and July 2018 within ASU No. 2017-03
 ASU No. 2018-01
 ASU No. 2018-10
 and ASU No.
2018-11 regarding qualitative disclosures
 optional practical expedients
 codification improvements and an optional transition
method to adopt with a cumulative-effect adjustment versus a modified retrospective approach. These updates do not change the
core principle of the guidance under ASU No. 2016-02
 but rather provide implementation guidance. This pronouncement will have
no impact on these financial statements.

In
August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13
 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework &#8211; Changes to the
Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement
 which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurement by removing
modifying
 and adding certain disclosures. This ASU is effective for the annual period beginning after December 15
 2019
 including
interim periods within that annual period. . We do not expect his pronouncement will not have a material impact on our financial
statements.

In
August 2018
 the SEC adopted amendments to simplify certain disclosure requirements
 as set forth in Securities Act Release No.
33-10532
 Disclosure Update and Simplification
 which includes a requirement for entities to present the changes in shareholders&#8217;
equity in the interim financial statements in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. This amendment is effective for all filings made
on or after November 5
 2018. In light of the timing of effectiveness of the amendment and proximity to the filing date for most
filers&#8217; quarterly reports
 the SEC has allowed for a filer&#8217;s first presentation of the changes in shareholders&#8217;
equity to be included in its Form 10-Q for the quarter that begins after the effective date. . We do not expect his pronouncement
will not have a material impact on our financial statements.

2014-15&#8221;).

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts
or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

The
Company&#8217;s financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company has ceased operations for the time being
and is in the process of pursuing business opportunities for the Company to resume as a going concern.

As
reflected in the financial statements
 the Company had an accumulated deficit of $5
230
429 at December 31
 2018 and no revenue
for the year then ended. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern
in the future once it acquires a viable entity.



































The entire disclosure when substantial doubt is raised about the ability to continue as a going concern. Includes
 but is not limited to
 principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern
 management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the ability to meet its obligations
 and management's plans that alleviated or are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern.

Lone
Star operates in the United States; accordingly
 federal and state income taxes have been provided based upon the tax laws and
rates of the US. Deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax
bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates
 which will be in effect when these differences reverse.
&#160;
&#160;


The
    Company is subject to United States income taxes at a rate of 21% on the first $315
000 of taxable profits. The reconciliation
    of the provision for income taxes at the United States statutory rate compared to the Company&#8217;s income tax expense as
    reported is as follows:

for a purchase price consisting of 12
000
&#8221;).
The transaction was completed and closed on February 12
 2019. The Class &#8220;A&#8221; preferred stock was transferred from
Mr. William Alessi.

On
February 6
 2019
 the Company terminated its acquisition agreement with Infinity
 Inc. because the acquisition transaction had
not closed by January 14
 2019
 as required by the agreement. Pursuant to the Agreement
 which was entered into on November 28
2018 the Company was to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Infinity
 Inc. under certain conditions.

On
February 28
 2019
 the Company was advised that FINRA had received the necessary documentation to announce a 1:100 reverse split.
This corporate action took effect on 3/1/2019. The new symbol as of March 1
 2019 will be LSTGD. Please note that a &#8220;D&#8221;
has been appended as the 5th character for 20 business days including the effective date.
&#160;

On
March 14
 2019 the Company borrowed $50
000 from an unrelated third party. The loan is unsecured

and is due and payable on September 14
 2019. At the option of the note holder
 the note may at any time be converted into shares
of the Company&#8217;s common stock. The number of shares to be issued upon conversion will be determined by dividing the amount
to be converted by 60% of the average of the three lowest closing prices of the Company&#8217;s common stock during the ten trading
days immediately preceding the conversion date. If at any time prior to July 14
 2020 the Company sells or issues any shares of
its common stock at a price below $1.20 per share the Company will issue such number of additional shares of its common stock
to the note holder as determined by the following:


B
= C


$1.20

These
financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States and are expressed in US dollars.

The
Company&#8217;s fiscal year-end is December 31.




The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company
regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the recoverability of long-lived assets and deferred income tax asset
valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts
 historical experience and various other
factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company&#8217;s estimates. To the extent
there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results
 future results of operations will be affected.




For
purposes of the statement of cash flows
 cash equivalents include demand deposits
 money market funds
 and all highly liquid debt
instructions with original maturities of three months or less.





The
FASB issued ASC 820-10
 
 for financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 provides
a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. ASC 820-10 defines fair
value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal
or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 also establishes
a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
 where available. The following summarizes
the three levels of inputs required by the standard that the Company uses to measure fair value:



    
Level 1: Quoted
    prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

    
Level 2: Observable
    inputs other than Level 1 prices
 such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are
    not active
 or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full
    term of the related assets or liabilities.

    
Level 3: Unobservable
    inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.






The
Company does not have any financial asset and therefore is not exposed to any credit risks.

Cash

 its cash
and cash equivalents with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. The Company&#8217;s
management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds
 and as such
it believes that any associated credit risk exposures are limited.




The
Company computes net income or loss per share in accordance with ASC 260 Earnings per Share. Under the provisions of the Earnings
per Share Topic ASC
 basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders for the period
by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted net loss per
share gives effect to common stock equivalents; however
 potential common shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive.




The
Company accounts for its income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 Income Taxes
 which requires recognition of deferred tax assets
and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations
in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that would
otherwise be recorded for income tax benefits primarily relating to operating loss carryforwards as realization cannot be determined
to be more likely than not.

The
statement establishes a more-likely-than-not threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements.
Also
 the statement implements a process for measuring those tax positions which meet the recognition threshold of being ultimately
sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. There are no uncertain tax positions taken by the Company on its tax returns
and the adoption of the statement had no material impact to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. The Company
files tax returns in the US and states in which it has operations and is subject to taxation. Tax years subsequent to 2013 remain
open to examination by U.S. federal and state tax jurisdictions.




The
Company follows ASC 450-20
 
 to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies
arising from claims
 assessments
 litigation
 fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability
has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated.




In
June 2018
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued ASU No. 2018-07
 Compensation &#8211; Stock Compensation
(Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting
 which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based
payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees except for certain circumstances. Any transition impact
will be a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. This ASU is effective
for the annual period beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within that annual period and early adoption
is permitted. We have adopted this guidance on January 1
 2019 and there is no material impact on our financial statements.
&#160;
&#160;
In
February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842)
 which will require organizations that lease assets to recognize
on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. Qualitative and quantitative
disclosures are required
 and optional practical expedients may be elected. This ASU is effective for the annual period beginning
after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within that annual period. Subsequent amendments to the initial guidance have
been issued in January 2017
 January 2018
 and July 2018 within ASU No. 2017-03
 ASU No. 2018-01
 ASU No. 2018-10
 and ASU No.
2018-11 regarding qualitative disclosures
 optional practical expedients
 codification improvements and an optional transition
method to adopt with a cumulative-effect adjustment versus a modified retrospective approach. These updates do not change the
core principle of the guidance under ASU No. 2016-02
 but rather provide implementation guidance. This pronouncement will have
no impact on these financial statements.

In
August 2018
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13
 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework &#8211; Changes to the
Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement
 which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurement by removing
modifying
 and adding certain disclosures. This ASU is effective for the annual period beginning after December 15
 2019
 including
interim periods within that annual period. . We do not expect his pronouncement will not have a material impact on our financial
statements.

In
August 2018
 the SEC adopted amendments to simplify certain disclosure requirements
 as set forth in Securities Act Release No.
33-10532
 Disclosure Update and Simplification
 which includes a requirement for entities to present the changes in shareholders&#8217;
equity in the interim financial statements in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. This amendment is effective for all filings made
on or after November 5
 2018. In light of the timing of effectiveness of the amendment and proximity to the filing date for most
filers&#8217; quarterly reports
 the SEC has allowed for a filer&#8217;s first presentation of the changes in shareholders&#8217;
equity to be included in its Form 10-Q for the quarter that begins after the effective date. . We do not expect his pronouncement
will not have a material impact on our financial statements.&#160;
