 2015 (the Closing Date)
 we sold our assets and various liabilities related to our brewery and micro-brewing operations and are no longer in that business after the Closing Date.&#160; We recognized the sale of our brewery and micro-brewing operations as a discontinued operation
 in accordance with accounting guidelines.&#160; See further discussion below under 



 2015.&#160; Our b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha is a gluten free

 all natural
 fermented black teas made with purified water
 organic cane juice
 and kombucha culture with origins in China tracing back more than 2
000 years.&#160; Kombucha products contain a colony of bacteria and yeast with more than 1 billion microorganisms.&#160; The product end result is rich in probiotics
 B-Vitamins and other nutritional ingredients.&#160; Health benefits are mostly anecdotal but reputed to support digestion

 most competitors utilize small batch production processes and are handcrafted in nature.&#160; This leads to significant differences between batches and potential inconsistency in flavor and character every time.&#160; In contrast
 we use large batch-controlled production processes.&#160; This statistically controlled approach
 coupled with our proprietary production processes
 leads to product stability
 consistency




 our proprietary process also leads to a superior balanced flavor profile with a crisp clean finish and no harsh vinegar taste that is typically associated with competitive kombucha products.&#160; This more rounded and balanced complex flavor profile enables b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha to appeal to a more mainstream consumer without alienating hardcore kombucha advocates























 marketing and distribution company and believe that the b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha brand
 the level of retail distribution and penetration across all channels
 and our retail relationships will be our greatest determinants of market value over the long term.&#160; We currently utilize a hybrid production model whereby we purchase raw ingredients and packaging materials directly
 and utilize the services of third-party manufacturers for production.&#160; Currently we utilize the services of one third-party manufacturer
 Unix Packaging Inc. in Southern California.&#160; We then ship nationally from that location.&#160; From a logistics standpoint
 this structure leads to increased distribution expense
 thereby having a negative impact on our gross margins.&#160; In the future
 we believe that we can expand our relationships into new geographies regions in order to lower supply chain and production costs




 non-exclusive supply contract that concludes in December 2016
 but that we can renew upon mutual agreement.&#160; We currently purchase our raw ingredients and packaging materials directly from our suppliers and then consolidate them.&#160; Our component raw materials and packaging materials are readily available through multiple vendors
 with limited perceived risk to consistent supply.&#160; Anchor Glass Container Corporation is our principal packaging supplier
 and California Custom Fruits and Flavors
 Inc. is our primary ingredient supplier







000 stores throughout the United States and Canada and mostly in the food
 drug and mass market and specialty health food stores.&#160; To penetrate those channels and further expand national distribution
 we have engaged sales agents
 brokers
 and regional and large national distributors to support our distribution expansion and retailer management efforts.&#160; We have also retained Horizon
 UNFI
 KeHE Distributors
 R&amp;K Foods
 Unified Grocers
 DPI Specialty Foods and others as distributors.&#160; Currently
 we sell all of our products to our retailers either direct or through brokers and distributors.&#160; Our larger retail clients purchase our product through their own warehouse distribution network.&#160; Our current retail clients include Whole Foods
 Kroger
 Safeway
 Vons and Ralphs and multiple smaller independent food




 drug and mass market and specialty health food stores.&#160; Like most competitors in ready-to-drink healthy beverages
 we expect to compete in all channels including food
 drug
 mass

 we anticipate that we will be required to invest in marketing and advertising to ensure consumer purchases and retailer sell-through off the shelf.&#160; We expect to continue to offer promotional allowances
 trial and sampling programs
 and other initiatives to support our retailers.&#160; These marketing investments range from 5% to 15% of net sales
 and are similar to most other beverage company promotional programs.&#160;&#160; Many retailers request some type of promotional introductory program
 slotting fees or other incentives
 which can be as much as 10% of net sales.&#160; Thus far
 we have been successful in mitigating or even eliminating these introductory fees and have been able to offset them with additional goods

 the kombucha category has been rapidly growing at more than 40% per year compounded annually for the last five years and reached $529 million in retail sales in the United States for 2015.&#160; It is a global business with the United States accounting for an estimated 39.4% of the global market.&#160; The kombucha segment is growing rapidly along with the overall healthy

 either through the sale of equity or debt securities
 to meet our planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the next 12 months.&#160; We estimate that our capital needs over the next 12 months will be $400

000.&#160; We will require additional cash resources to achieve the milestones indicated above.&#160; If our own financial resources and future current cash flows from operations are insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements
 we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities.&#160; The sale of additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders.&#160; The incurrence of indebtedness will result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that could restrict our operations or modify our plans to grow the business.&#160; Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us

 a trace amount of alcohol is produced
 typically less than 0.5%.&#160; This trace alcohol amount allows the products to be commercialized as non-alcoholic beverages.&#160; The fact that there are trace amounts of alcohol led to consumer confusion in 2011 and 2012
 which led to product recalls from various retailers.&#160; Although the manufacture of our b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha products utilizes strict quality control processes in its production processes to keep its products at trace levels
 not all kombucha products in the industry are manufactured under the same standards.&#160; In addition

 due to their different production processes
 may experience secondary fermentation in their bottles

 we have a limited operating history from which investors can evaluate our business.&#160; Our ability to successfully develop our products
 and to realize consistent
 meaningful revenues and profit has not been established and cannot be assured.&#160; For us to achieve success
 our products must receive broad market acceptance by consumers.&#160; Without this market acceptance

 two insiders with only one independent director.&#160; As such
 we do not have an independent audit committee
 compensation committee or governance committee.&#160; As a result











 due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects.&#160; This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance.&#160; Moreover
 the OTCQB is not a stock exchange
 and trading of securities on the OTCQB is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a national securities exchange like the NASDAQ or the NYSE.&#160; Accordingly








 a decline in the price of our common stock could be detrimental to our liquidity and our operations because the decline may cause investors not to choose to invest in our stock.&#160; If we are unable to raise the funds we require for all our planned operations
 we may be forced to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may suffer a significant negative effect on our business plan and operations
 including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations.&#160; As a result
 our business may suffer








 payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors
 and will depend upon
 among other things
 the results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition
 operating and capital requirements
 and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant.&#160; There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid
 and if dividends are paid
 there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend.&#160; Unless we pay dividends

























 subject to certain exceptions.&#160; Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules
 which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors.&#160; The term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5
000
000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1
000
000 or annual income exceeding $200
000 or $300
000 jointly with their spouse.&#160; The penny stock rules require a broker- dealer
 prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules
 to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC
 which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market.&#160; The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock
 the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account.&#160; The bid and offer quotations
 and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information
 must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation.&#160; In addition
 the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction.&#160; These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules.&#160; Consequently







 the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer
 a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer.&#160; Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers
 broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status
 tax status
 investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules
 FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers.&#160; FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock

 as amended
 is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms
 and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our interim president and chief executive officer (who is the Company's principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer
 treasurer
 and secretary (who is the Company's principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.&#160; In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures
 management recognizes that any controls and procedures
 no matter how well designed and operated
 can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives
 and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.&#160; The ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures was due to material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting







 as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.&#160; Our management
 with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has conducted an assessment
 including testing
 using the criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) (2013).&#160; Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.&#160; Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.&#160; This assessment included review of the documentation of controls
 evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls
 testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation.&#160; Based on this evaluation
 management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31







































 we are currently reviewing our disclosure controls and procedures related to these material weaknesses and expect to implement changes in the next fiscal year
 including identifying specific areas within our governance








 internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.&#160; Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.&#160; All internal control systems
 no matter how well designed
 have inherent limitations.&#160; Therefore







 2015 that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.&#160; We believe that a control system
 no matter how well designed and operated
 cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met
 and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any






 plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting.&#160; During the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K
 we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above.&#160; To remediate such weaknesses


























 remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner.&#160; Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
 if any





 our financial statements for the year ended December 31

 stock warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under the relevant sections of ASC Topic 815-40
.&#160; The result of this accounting treatment could be that the fair value of a financial instrument is classified as a derivative instrument and is marked-to-market at each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability.&#160; In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability
 the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income or other expense.&#160; Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument
 the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity.&#160; Financial instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under ASC Topic 815-40 are reclassified to a liability account at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date.&#160; The Company determined that none of its financial instruments meet the criteria for derivative accounting as of December 31

 there is no impairment.&#160; If the reporting unit's carrying amount is determined to be greater than the fair value
 the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment

 excluding goodwill
 of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step one.&#160; The implied fair value of the goodwill in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill.&#160; If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value of the goodwill

 the change in&#13;fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income or other expense.&amp;#160; Upon conversion or exercise of a&#13;derivative instrument
 the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to&#13;equity.&amp;#160; Financial instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under ASC Topic&#13;815-40 are reclassified to a liability account at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date.&amp;#160; The Company&#13;determined that none of its financial instruments meet the criteria for derivative accounting as of December 31
 2015 (Successor)&#13;and December 31

 if any related equity instruments&#13;were granted with the debt. In accordance with this guidance

 the Company entered into a factoring agreement to sell
 with recourse
 certain receivables to an unrelated third-party financial&#13;institution.&amp;#160; Under the terms of the factoring agreement
 the Company receives an advance of 80% of qualified receivables&#13;and maximum amount of outstanding advances at any one time will not exceed $500

 the Company received net advances from the factoring of accounts receivable of $110
663 and recognized factoring&#13;interest and fees of $34
069.&amp;#160; The Company pays factoring fees associated with the sale of receivables at the rate of 0.67%&#13;of the gross face value of the receivable for every ten-day period or fraction thereof from the date of the advance until the&#13;receivable is paid in full.&amp;#160; The outstanding factoring payable as of December 31

 &lt;i&gt;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&lt;/i&gt;
 goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful&#13;lives are not amortized but tested for impairment annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicates that the carrying&#13;value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its fair value.&amp;#160; &lt;/font&gt;The goodwill impairment test is applied by&#13;performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit.&amp;#160; If
 on the basis of qualitative&#13;factors
 it is considered not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount
&#13;further testing of goodwill for impairment would not be required.&amp;#160; Otherwise

 there is no impairment.&amp;#160; If the reporting unit's carrying amount is determined to be greater&#13;than the fair value
 the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment
 if any.&amp;#160; The second step involves&#13;calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible assets
 excluding goodwill
&#13;of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step one.&amp;#160; The implied fair value of the&#13;goodwill in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill.&amp;#160; If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than&#13;the carrying value of the goodwill

 or when it can be separated&#13;or divided from the acquired entity and sold

 packaging and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in
 first-out basis) or market&#13;value.&amp;#160; Provisions for excess inventory are included in cost of goods sold and have historically been immaterial but adequate&#13;to provide for losses on its raw materials.&amp;#160; There was no reserve for obsolescence as of December 31
 2015 (Successor) and&#13;December 31

 Income Taxes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&amp;#160; The liability method measures deferred income taxes by applying enacted statutory rates&#13;in effect at the balance sheet date to the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts&#13;on the financial statements.&amp;#160; The resulting deferred tax assets or liabilities have been adjusted to reflect changes in tax&#13;laws as they occur.&amp;#160; A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not&#13;be realized.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=line-height: 11.4pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=color: #000000; font: 10pt/11.4pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt&gt;The&#13;Company expects to recognize the financial statement benefit of an uncertain tax position only after considering the probability&#13;that a tax authority would sustain the position in an examination.&amp;#160; For tax positions meeting a more-likely-than-not threshold
&#13;the amount to be recognized in the financial statements will be the benefit expected to be realized upon settlement with the tax&#13;authority.&amp;#160; For tax positions not meeting the threshold
 no financial statement benefit is recognized.&amp;#160; As of December&#13;31
 2015
 the Company had no uncertain tax positions.&amp;#160; The Company recognizes interest and penalties
 if any

 no provision for income&#13;taxes has been reflected in these financial statements.&amp;#160; The Predecessor has no unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31

 whichever is more dilutive.&amp;#160; As the Company incurred net losses&#13;for the years ended December 31
 2015 (Successor) and 2014 (Predecessor)
 no potentially dilutive securities were included in the&#13;calculation of diluted earnings per share as the impact would have been anti-dilutive.&amp;#160; Therefore
 basic and dilutive net&#13;income (loss) per share were the same.&amp;#160; If the Company had net income
 potential dilutive securities consists of warrants&#13;to purchase 1

 2015
 the Company acquired substantially&#13;all of the operating assets of B&amp;#38;R Liquid Adventure
 LLC
 a California Limited Liability Company (&amp;#34;B&amp;#38;R&amp;#34;) (the&#13;&amp;#34;Acquisition&amp;#34;).&amp;#160; B&amp;#38;R is engaged in the manufacture of b&amp;#250;cha&amp;#174; Live Kombucha
 a gluten free
 organic&#13;certified
 sparkling kombucha tea.&amp;#160; On April 1
 2015
 the parties executed all documents related to the Acquisition.&amp;#160;&#13;Upon the closing of the Acquisition
 the Company received substantially all of the operating assets of B&amp;#38;R
 consisting of inventory

 a fermented
 probiotic tea beverage
&#13;offers a myriad of health benefits.&amp;#160; With the acquisition of the b&amp;#250;cha&amp;#174; Live Kombucha brand
 which features eight&#13;flavors

000
 a secured promissory note in an amount of $140
000 and the issuance 1
479
290 shares&#13;of common stock valued at $500
000.&amp;#160; In addition
 the Company assumed $121

479
290 shares of common stock were issued&#13;with &amp;#34;Price Protection&amp;#34; for a period of 18 months
 meaning that on the date that is 18 months from the date of the Acquisition
&#13;if the market value of the common stock issued pursuant to the Acquisition is less than $500
000
 the Company shall issue additional&#13;shares so the aggregate amount of shares held by B&amp;#38;R is equal to a market value of $500
000 based on the average closing bid&#13;price of the common stock for the five days prior thereto.&amp;#160; The Company determined the fair value of the 1
479
290 shares&#13;issued as of December 31
 2015 to be higher than $500

 the Predecessor got in a dispute&#13;with Devil's Canyon Brewery (&amp;#34;DCB&amp;#34;) over damage allegedly caused by the Predecessor to certain brewing tanks and related&#13;premises damage arising out of the Predecessor's use of DBC's facilities for brewing of its products.&amp;#160; The Predecessor's insurance&#13;carrier paid for certain repairs which DCB subsequently contended were insufficient.&amp;#160; Dissatisfied with the repairs
 in September&#13;2012
 DCB filed a lawsuit against the Predecessor.&amp;#160; The Predecessor vigorously defended the action while concurrently seeking&#13;to settle the action.&amp;#160; Mediation and settlement conferences were unsuccessful and a jury trial commenced in October 2013.&amp;#160;&#13;The jury found in favor of DCB's breach of contract claims and awarded damages in the amount of $130
700
 which is recorded as&#13;reserve for legal settlement on the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31
 2013.&amp;#160; The Predecessor's insurance carrier&#13;subsequently paid what it contended was its policy limits of $113

 DCB filed a motion for attorneys'&#13;fees seeking approximately $355
000.&amp;#160; In January 2014
 the Predecessor filed its own motion seeking approximately $234
000&#13;in attorneys' fees contending that it should be designated the prevailing party in this action.&amp;#160; In March 2014
 the court&#13;denied the Predecessor's motion for attorneys' fees and granted DCB's motion for approximately $268
000
 which the court later&#13;modified increasing the award in favor of DCB to $316
545.&amp;#160; The Predecessor appealed to the court and the appeal remained&#13;pending as of December 31

 2015
&#13;the parties settled the case with the Predecessor agreeing to pay $275
000 in full and final settlement of the case.&amp;#160; The&#13;Predecessor is indebted to its attorney for fees and costs in the amount of approximately $182
000 as of December 31

&#13;the Company entered into a factoring agreement to sell
 with recourse
 certain receivables to an unrelated third-party financial&#13;institution.&amp;#160; Under the terms of the factoring agreement
 the Company receives an advance of 80% of qualified receivables&#13;and maximum amount of outstanding advances at any one time will not exceed $500

 &lt;i&gt;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&lt;/i&gt;
 goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful&#13;lives are not amortized but tested for impairment annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicates that the carrying&#13;value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its fair value.&amp;#160; &lt;/font&gt;The goodwill impairment test is applied by&#13;performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit.&amp;#160; If
 on the basis of qualitative&#13;factors
 it is considered not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount
&#13;further testing of goodwill for impairment would not be required.&amp;#160; Otherwise

 there is no impairment.&amp;#160; If the reporting unit's carrying amount is determined to be greater&#13;than the fair value
 the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment
 if any.&amp;#160; The second step involves&#13;calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible assets
 excluding goodwill
&#13;of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step one.&amp;#160; The implied fair value of the&#13;goodwill in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill.&amp;#160; If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than&#13;the carrying value of the goodwill

NOTE
1 &#150; ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION


Company
 Inc. (the Company) was formed under the laws of the State of Washington on April 26
 2010.&#160; Through September 30
2015
 the Company was a micro-brewing company and also manufactured and sold b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha
 a gluten free
 organic
certified
 sparkling kombucha tea.&#160; The Company acquired the b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha brand and the assets related
to the production and sale of it pursuant to an agreement dated April 1
 2015 (see Note 4).&#160; The b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha
brand is distributed in major health and grocery chains throughout North America.


1
 2015 (the Closing Date)
 the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the APA) whereby the Company sold its assets
and various liabilities related to its brewery and micro-brewing operations to AMBREW
 LLC
 a Washington limited liability company
(AMBREW).&#160; On the closing date
 the parties executed all documents related to the transaction.&#160; Under the terms of
the APA
 the assets sold consisted of accounts receivable
 inventories
 prepaid assets and property and equipment.&#160; The liabilities
consisted of brewing-related contracts held by the Company
 liabilities related to inventory as well as lease obligations.&#160;
The Company recognized the sale of its brewery and micro-brewing operations as a discontinued operation
 in accordance with ASU
2014-08
 


1
 2015
 the Company is focusing exclusively on its b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha business
 which produces a gluten-free
 organic
certified sparkling kombucha tea.



of Presentation

 (see Note 4)
 the Company
is referred to as the Successor and its results of operations combines the brewery operations and the kombucha tea operations.&#160;




to highlight the lack of comparability between these two periods.


Concern



accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates
among other things
 the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.&#160; The Company
had an accumulated deficit of $3
331
878 and $4
863
782 as of as of December 31
 2015 (Successor) and 2014 (Predecessor)
 respectively
had net losses of $1

 2015 (Predecessor) and for the year ended 2014 (Predecessor)
 respectively
 and had negative working capital of
$45
138 as of December 31
 2015.&#160; These matters
 among others
 raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue
as a going concern.


the Company is attempting to increase sales and generate additional revenues
 the Company's cash position may not be significant
enough to support the Company's daily operations.&#160; If the Company is unable to obtain additional financing through the issuance
of debt or equity
 the Company may be unable to continue as a going concern.&#160; While the Company believes in the viability
of its strategy to generate additional revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds
 there can be no assurances to that
effect.&#160; The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets
or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

NOTE
2 &#150; SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating the Company's financial
statements.&#160; These accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles and have been consistently applied
in the preparation of the financial statements.


of Estimates


preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.&#160;
Actual results could differ from those estimates.&#160; The more significant estimates and assumptions made by management include
allowance for doubtful accounts
 inventory valuation
 provision for excess or expired inventory
 depreciation of property and equipment
realizability of long-lived assets and fair market value of equity instruments issued for goods or services.&#160; The current
economic environment has increased the degree and uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions.




period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.


and Cash Equivalents


and cash equivalents as of December 31
 2015 (Successor) and December 31
 2014 (Predecessor) included cash on-hand.&#160; Cash
equivalents are considered all accounts with an original&#160;maturity date within 90 days.


Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts


Company's accounts receivable primarily consists of trade receivables.&#160; The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts
that is based on historical trends
 customer knowledge
 any known disputes
 and the aging of the accounts receivable balances combined
with management's estimate of future potential recoverability.&#160; Receivables are written off against the allowance after all
attempts to collect a receivable have failed.&#160; The Company's allowance for doubtful accounts was zero as of December 31
 2015
(Successor) and $13
638 as of December 31
 2014 (Predecessor).


of Credit Risk


instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivables.&#160;
The Company places its cash with high credit quality financial institutions.&#160; At times such amounts may exceed federally insured
limits.


arising from sales of the Company's products are not collateralized. As of December 31
 2015 (Successor)
 three customers represented
approximately 92.8% (59.0%
 22.9% and 10.9%) of accounts receivable.&#160; As of December 31
 2014 (Predecessor)
 four customers
represented approximately 75.1% (25.4%
 24.0%
 13.5% and 12.1%) of accounts receivable.


the nine months ended December 31
 2015 (Successor)
 three customers represented approximately 75.6% (32.7%
 24.2% and 18.6%) of
total revenue.&#160; For the three months ended March 31
 2015 (Predecessor)
 three customers represented approximately 85.6% (30.2%
29.4% and 26.0%) of total revenue.&#160; For the year ended December 31
 2014 (Predecessor)
 four customers represented approximately
84.5% (28.1%
 18.9%
 18.9% and 18.6%) of revenue.


Value of Financial Instruments


financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents
 accounts payable and accrued expenses and shareholder loans.&#160;
The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that
approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements.


for Derivative Liabilities


Company evaluates stock options
 stock warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those
contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under the relevant sections of ASC Topic 815-40

.&#160; The result of this accounting treatment
could be that the fair value of a financial instrument is classified as a derivative instrument and is marked-to-market at each
balance sheet date and recorded as a liability.&#160; In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability
 the change in
fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income or other expense.&#160; Upon conversion or exercise of a
derivative instrument
 the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to
equity.&#160; Financial instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under ASC Topic
815-40 are reclassified to a liability account at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date.&#160; The Company
determined that none of its financial instruments meet the criteria for derivative accounting as of December 31
 2015 (Successor)
and December 31
 2014 (Predecessor).


Conversion Features


has from time to time issued convertible notes that may have conversion prices that create an embedded pursuant to accounting guidance.&#160;
A beneficial conversion feature exists on the date a convertible note is issued when the fair value of the underlying common stock
to which the note is convertible into is in excess of the remaining unallocated proceeds of the note after first considering the
allocation of a portion of the note proceeds to the fair value of any attached equity instruments
 if any related equity instruments
were granted with the debt. In accordance with this guidance
 the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature is recorded
as a debt discount with a corresponding amount to additional paid in capital.&#160; The debt discount is amortized to interest
expense over the life of the note using the effective interest method.


Receivable Factoring Arrangement with Recourse


2015
 the Company entered into a factoring agreement to sell
 with recourse
 certain receivables to an unrelated third-party financial
institution.&#160; Under the terms of the factoring agreement
 the Company receives an advance of 80% of qualified receivables
and maximum amount of outstanding advances at any one time will not exceed $500
000.&#160; For the nine months ended December
31
 2015 (Successor)
 the Company received net advances from the factoring of accounts receivable of $110
663 and recognized factoring
interest and fees of $34
069.&#160; The Company pays factoring fees associated with the sale of receivables at the rate of 0.67%
of the gross face value of the receivable for every ten-day period or fraction thereof from the date of the advance until the
receivable is paid in full.&#160; The outstanding factoring payable as of December 31
 2015 was $110
663.

performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit.&#160; If
 on the basis of qualitative
factors
 it is considered not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount
further testing of goodwill for impairment would not be required.&#160; Otherwise
 goodwill impairment is tested using a two-step
approach.


value of a company's reporting units to their carrying amount.&#160; If the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be
greater than its carrying amount
 there is no impairment.&#160; If the reporting unit's carrying amount is determined to be greater
than the fair value
 the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment
 if any.&#160; The second step involves
calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible assets
 excluding goodwill
of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step one.&#160; The implied fair value of the
goodwill in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill.&#160; If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than
the carrying value of the goodwill
 an impairment loss equivalent to the difference is recorded.&#160; The Company performed a
qualitative assessment and determined there was no impairment of goodwill recognized during 2015.

 or when it can be separated
or divided from the acquired entity and sold
 transferred
 licensed
 rented or exchanged
 either individually or in combination
with a related contract
 asset or liability.&#160; Such intangibles are amortized over their useful lives.&#160; Impairment losses
are recognized is the carrying amount of an&#160; intangible asset subject to amortization is not recoverable from expected future
cash flows and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value.




Compensation&#151;Stock
&#160; Stock-based compensation to employees is measured at the grant date
 based on the fair value of
the award
 and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period.&#160; The Company accounts for stock-based
compensation to other than employees in accordance with FASB ASC 505-50.&#160; Equity instruments issued to other than employees
are valued at the earlier of a commitment date or upon completion of the services
 based on the fair value of the equity instruments
and is recognized as expense over the service period.&#160; The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based payments using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for common stock options and warrants and the latest fair market price of the Company's
common stock for common share issuances.


and Provision for Excess or Expired Inventory


consist of tea ingredients
 packaging and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in
 first-out basis) or market
value.&#160; Provisions for excess inventory are included in cost of goods sold and have historically been immaterial but adequate
to provide for losses on its raw materials.&#160; There was no reserve for obsolescence as of December 31
 2015 (Successor) and
December 31
 2014 (Predecessor).


and Equipment


and equipment consists primarily of brewing equipment and are stated at cost.&#160; Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method based upon the estimated useful lives of the underlying assets
 generally five years.&#160; Major renewals and betterments
that extend the life of the property are capitalized.&#160; Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.


Assets


Company's long-lived assets consisted of property and equipment and customer relationships and are reviewed for impairment in accordance
with the guidance of the FASB Topic ASC 360
 Property
 Plant
.&#160;
The Company tests for impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.&#160; Through December 31
 2015
 the Company had not experienced
impairment losses on its long-lived assets as management determined that there were no indicators that a carrying amount of the
asset may not be recoverable.


Recognition


Company's products are distributed in major health and grocery chains throughout North America.&#160; Revenue is recognized upon
delivery of goods to the customer.&#160; An allowance for estimated returns is provided at the time of the sale.&#160; In accordance
with the guidance in FASB Topic ASC 605
 
the Company recognizes revenue when (a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 (b) delivery has occurred or services have
been rendered
 (c) the fee is fixed or determinable
 and (d) collectability is reasonable assured.


of Goods Sold


of goods sold mainly consisted of raw material costs
 packaging costs
 direct labor and certain overhead allocated costs.&#160;
Costs are recognized when the related revenue is recorded.&#160; Shipping and handling costs for all wholesale sales transactions
are billed to the customer and are included in costs of goods sold for all periods presented.


Promotions and Sales


promotional and selling expenses consisted of sales salaries
 tap handles
 media advertising costs
 sales and marketing expenses
and promotional activity expenses and are recognized when incurred in the accompanying statement of operations.


and Administrative Expenses


and administrative expenses consisted of professional service fees
 rent and utility expenses
 meals
 travel and entertainment
expenses
 and other general and administrative overhead costs.&#160; Expenses are recognized when incurred.


Programs and Incentives


programs and incentives
 which include customer promotional discount programs and customer incentives
 are a common practice in
the alcohol beverage industry.&#160; The Company incurs customer program costs to promote sales of products and to maintain competitive
pricing.&#160; Amounts paid in connection with customer programs and incentives are recorded as reductions to net revenue or as
advertising
 promotional and selling expenses in accordance with ASC Topic 605-50

Revenue Recognition&#151;Customer Payments and Incentives
 based on the nature of the expenditure.


Taxes




Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed under
ASC 740
&#160; The liability method measures deferred income taxes by applying enacted statutory rates
in effect at the balance sheet date to the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts
on the financial statements.&#160; The resulting deferred tax assets or liabilities have been adjusted to reflect changes in tax
laws as they occur.&#160; A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not
be realized.


Company expects to recognize the financial statement benefit of an uncertain tax position only after considering the probability
that a tax authority would sustain the position in an examination.&#160; For tax positions meeting a more-likely-than-not threshold
the amount to be recognized in the financial statements will be the benefit expected to be realized upon settlement with the tax
authority.&#160; For tax positions not meeting the threshold
 no financial statement benefit is recognized.&#160; As of December
31
 2015
 the Company had no uncertain tax positions.&#160; The Company recognizes interest and penalties
 if any
 related to uncertain
tax positions as general and administrative expenses.&#160; The Company currently has no federal tax examinations nor has it had
any federal income tax penalties since its inception.




Predecessor is a limited liability corporation and is classified as a partnership for income tax purposes.&#160; The Predecessor
profits and losses are reportable by the members on their respective income tax returns.&#160; Accordingly
 no provision for income
taxes has been reflected in these financial statements.&#160; The Predecessor has no unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31
2014.


Income (Loss) Per Share


net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average common shares outstanding.&#160;
Diluted net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the
period using the treasury stock method or the two-class method
 whichever is more dilutive.&#160; As the Company incurred net losses
for the years ended December 31
 2015 (Successor) and 2014 (Predecessor)
 no potentially dilutive securities were included in the
calculation of diluted earnings per share as the impact would have been anti-dilutive.&#160; Therefore
 basic and dilutive net
income (loss) per share were the same.&#160; If the Company had net income
 potential dilutive securities consists of warrants
to purchase 1
127
000 and 875
042 shares of common stock as of December 31
 2015 (Successor) and December 31
 2014 (Predecessor)
respectively.


Accounting Pronouncements


does not believe that any recently issued
 but not yet effective accounting pronouncements
 if adopted
 would have a material effect
on the accompanying financial statements.

NOTE 3 &#150; DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS &#150;
BREWERY AND MICRO-BREWING OPERATIONS


 2015 (the &#34;Closing Date&#34;)
the Company entered into an APA whereby it sold its assets and various liabilities related to its brewery and micro-brewing operations
to AMBREW (the &#34;Sale&#34;.)&#160; On the Closing Date
 the parties executed all documents related to the Sale.&#160; Under
the terms of the APA
 the assets sold consisted of accounts receivable
 inventories
 prepaid assets and property and equipment.&#160;
The liabilities consisted of brewing-related contracts held by the Company
 liabilities related to inventory as well as lease obligations.&#160;
The Sale price was paid in cash of $395
650 and assumed debt owed to a third party related to three equipment financing agreements
and various capital lease arrangements (See Note 8.)


namely that the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board (&#34;WSLCB&#34;) shall have approved AMBREW's assumption of the Company's
WSLCB license and issued a corresponding license in AMBREW's name to operate the assets of the business from and after the Closing
Date (the &#34;WSLCB Condition&#34;).&#160; The parties intend
 to the maximum extent possible
 provided that the conditions
to Sale have occurred
 including specifically the WSLCB Condition
 that the benefits and obligations of ownership and operation

 the Predecessor got in a dispute
with Devil's Canyon Brewery (&#34;DCB&#34;) over damage allegedly caused by the Predecessor to certain brewing tanks and related
premises damage arising out of the Predecessor's use of DBC's facilities for brewing of its products.&#160; The Predecessor's insurance
carrier paid for certain repairs which DCB subsequently contended were insufficient.&#160; Dissatisfied with the repairs
 in September
2012
 DCB filed a lawsuit against the Predecessor.&#160; The Predecessor vigorously defended the action while concurrently seeking
to settle the action.&#160; Mediation and settlement conferences were unsuccessful and a jury trial commenced in October 2013.&#160;
The jury found in favor of DCB's breach of contract claims and awarded damages in the amount of $130
700
 which is recorded as
reserve for legal settlement on the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31
 2013.&#160; The Predecessor's insurance carrier
subsequently paid what it contended was its policy limits of $113
700 and the Predecessor paid the balance of the judgment in January
2014.


 DCB filed a motion for attorneys'
fees seeking approximately $355
000.&#160; In January 2014
 the Predecessor filed its own motion seeking approximately $234
000
in attorneys' fees contending that it should be designated the prevailing party in this action.&#160; In March 2014
 the court
denied the Predecessor's motion for attorneys' fees and granted DCB's motion for approximately $268
000
 which the court later
modified increasing the award in favor of DCB to $316
545.&#160; The Predecessor appealed to the court and the appeal remained
pending as of December 31
 2014.


 2015
the parties settled the case with the Predecessor agreeing to pay $275
000 in full and final settlement of the case.&#160; The
Predecessor is indebted to its attorney for fees and costs in the amount of approximately $182
000 as of December 31
 2014
 which
is recorded as accounts payable on the accompanying balance sheets.

Use
of Estimates


preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.&#160;
Actual results could differ from those estimates.&#160; The more significant estimates and assumptions made by management include
allowance for doubtful accounts
 inventory valuation
 provision for excess or expired inventory
 depreciation of property and equipment
realizability of long-lived assets and fair market value of equity instruments issued for goods or services.&#160; The current
economic environment has increased the degree and uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions.







period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.




Cash
and Cash Equivalents


and cash equivalents as of December 31
 2015 (Successor) and December 31
 2014 (Predecessor) included cash on-hand.&#160; Cash
equivalents are considered all accounts with an original&#160;maturity date within 90 days.





Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts


Company's accounts receivable primarily consists of trade receivables.&#160; The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts
that is based on historical trends
 customer knowledge
 any known disputes
 and the aging of the accounts receivable balances combined
with management's estimate of future potential recoverability.&#160; Receivables are written off against the allowance after all
attempts to collect a receivable have failed.&#160; The Company's allowance for doubtful accounts was zero as of December 31
 2015
(Successor) and $13
638 as of December 31
 2014 (Predecessor).




Concentrations
of Credit Risk


instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivables.&#160;
The Company places its cash with high credit quality financial institutions.&#160; At times such amounts may exceed federally insured
limits.


arising from sales of the Company's products are not collateralized. As of December 31

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments


financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents
 accounts payable and accrued expenses and shareholder loans.&#160;
The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that
approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements.




Accounting
for Derivative Liabilities


Company evaluates stock options
 stock warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those
contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under the relevant sections of ASC Topic 815-40

.&#160; The result of this accounting treatment
could be that the fair value of a financial instrument is classified as a derivative instrument and is marked-to-market at each
balance sheet date and recorded as a liability.&#160; In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability
 the change in
fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income or other expense.&#160; Upon conversion or exercise of a
derivative instrument
 the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to
equity.&#160; Financial instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under ASC Topic
815-40 are reclassified to a liability account at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date.&#160; The Company
determined that none of its financial instruments meet the criteria for derivative accounting as of December 31
 2015 (Successor)
and December 31
 2014 (Predecessor).




Beneficial
Conversion Features


has from time to time issued convertible notes that may have conversion prices that create an embedded pursuant to accounting guidance.&#160;
A beneficial conversion feature exists on the date a convertible note is issued when the fair value of the underlying common stock
to which the note is convertible into is in excess of the remaining unallocated proceeds of the note after first considering the
allocation of a portion of the note proceeds to the fair value of any attached equity instruments
 if any related equity instruments
were granted with the debt. In accordance with this guidance
 the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature is recorded
as a debt discount with a corresponding amount to additional paid in capital.&#160; The debt discount is amortized to interest
expense over the life of the note using the effective interest method.




Accounts
Receivable Factoring Arrangement with Recourse


the Company entered into a factoring agreement to sell
 with recourse
 certain receivables to an unrelated third-party financial
institution.&#160; Under the terms of the factoring agreement
 the Company receives an advance of 80% of qualified receivables
and maximum amount of outstanding advances at any one time will not exceed $500
000.&#160; For the nine months ended December 31
2015 (Successor)
 the Company received net advances from the factoring of accounts receivable of $110
663 and recognized factoring
interest and fees of $34
069.&#160; The Company pays factoring fees associated with the sale of receivables at the rate of 0.67%
of the gross face value of the receivable for every ten-day period or fraction thereof from the date of the advance until the receivable
is paid in full.&#160; The outstanding factoring payable as of December 31
 2015 was $110
663.

performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit.&#160; If
 on the basis of qualitative
factors
 it is considered not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount
further testing of goodwill for impairment would not be required.&#160; Otherwise
 goodwill impairment is tested using a two-step
approach.


value of a company's reporting units to their carrying amount.&#160; If the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be
greater than its carrying amount
 there is no impairment.&#160; If the reporting unit's carrying amount is determined to be greater
than the fair value
 the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment
 if any.&#160; The second step involves
calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible assets
 excluding goodwill
of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step one.&#160; The implied fair value of the
goodwill in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill.&#160; If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than
the carrying value of the goodwill
 an impairment loss equivalent to the difference is recorded.&#160; The Company performed a
qualitative assessment and determined there was no impairment of goodwill recognized during 2015.


asset apart from goodwill whenever the intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights
 or when it can be separated
or divided from the acquired entity and sold
 transferred
 licensed
 rented or exchanged
 either individually or in combination
with a related contract
 asset or liability.&#160; Such intangibles are amortized over their useful lives.&#160; Impairment losses
are recognized is the carrying amount of an&#160; intangible asset subject to amortization is not recoverable from expected future
cash flows and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value.





Share-Based
Compensation


Compensation&#151;Stock
&#160; Stock-based compensation to employees is measured at the grant date
 based on the fair value of
the award
 and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period.&#160; The Company accounts for stock-based
compensation to other than employees in accordance with FASB ASC 505-50.&#160; Equity instruments issued to other than employees
are valued at the earlier of a commitment date or upon completion of the services
 based on the fair value of the equity instruments
and is recognized as expense over the service period.&#160; The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based payments using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for common stock options and warrants and the latest fair market price of the Company's
common stock for common share issuances.




Inventories
and Provision for Excess or Expired Inventory


consist of tea ingredients
 packaging and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in
 first-out basis) or market
value.&#160; Provisions for excess inventory are included in cost of goods sold and have historically been immaterial but adequate
to provide for losses on its raw materials.&#160; There was no reserve for obsolescence as of December 31
 2015 (Successor) and
December 31
 2014 (Predecessor).




Property
and Equipment


and equipment consists primarily of brewing equipment and are stated at cost.&#160; Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method based upon the estimated useful lives of the underlying assets
 generally five years.&#160; Major renewals and betterments
that extend the life of the property are capitalized.&#160; Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.




Long-lived
Assets


Company's long-lived assets consisted of property and equipment and customer relationships and are reviewed for impairment in accordance
with the guidance of the FASB Topic ASC 360
 Property
 Plant
.&#160;
The Company tests for impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.&#160; Through December 31
 2015
 the Company had not experienced
impairment losses on its long-lived assets as management determined that there were no indicators that a carrying amount of the
asset may not be recoverable.




Revenue
Recognition


Company's products are distributed in major health and grocery chains throughout North America.&#160; Revenue is recognized upon
delivery of goods to the customer.&#160; An allowance for estimated returns is provided at the time of the sale.&#160; In accordance
with the guidance in FASB Topic ASC 605
 
the Company recognizes revenue when (a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 (b) delivery has occurred or services have
been rendered
 (c) the fee is fixed or determinable
 and (d) collectability is reasonable assured.




Cost
of Goods Sold


of goods sold mainly consisted of raw material costs
 packaging costs
 direct labor and certain overhead allocated costs.&#160;
Costs are recognized when the related revenue is recorded.&#160; Shipping and handling costs for all wholesale sales transactions
are billed to the customer and are included in costs of goods sold for all periods presented.



Advertising
 Promotions and Sales
Advertising
Promotions and Sales


promotional and selling expenses consisted of sales salaries
 tap handles
 media advertising costs
 sales and marketing expenses
and promotional activity expenses and are recognized when incurred in the accompanying statement of operations.




General

 rent and utility expenses
 meals
 travel and entertainment
expenses
 and other general and administrative overhead costs.&#160; Expenses are recognized when incurred.




Customer
Programs and Incentives


programs and incentives
 which include customer promotional discount programs and customer incentives
 are a common practice in
the alcohol beverage industry.&#160; The Company incurs customer program costs to promote sales of products and to maintain competitive
pricing.&#160; Amounts paid in connection with customer programs and incentives are recorded as reductions to net revenue or as
advertising
 promotional and selling expenses in accordance with ASC Topic 605-50

Revenue Recognition&#151;Customer Payments and Incentives
 based on the nature of the expenditure.




Income
Taxes




Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed under
ASC 740
&#160; The liability method measures deferred income taxes by applying enacted statutory rates
in effect at the balance sheet date to the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts
on the financial statements.&#160; The resulting deferred tax assets or liabilities have been adjusted to reflect changes in tax
laws as they occur.&#160; A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not
be realized.


Company expects to recognize the financial statement benefit of an uncertain tax position only after considering the probability
that a tax authority would sustain the position in an examination.&#160; For tax positions meeting a more-likely-than-not threshold
the amount to be recognized in the financial statements will be the benefit expected to be realized upon settlement with the tax
authority.&#160; For tax positions not meeting the threshold
 no financial statement benefit is recognized.&#160; As of December
31
 2015
 the Company had no uncertain tax positions.&#160; The Company recognizes interest and penalties
 if any
 related to uncertain
tax positions as general and administrative expenses.&#160; The Company currently has no federal tax examinations nor has it had
any federal income tax penalties since its inception.




Predecessor is a limited liability corporation and is classified as a partnership for income tax purposes.&#160; The Predecessor
profits and losses are reportable by the members on their respective income tax returns.&#160; Accordingly
 no provision for income
taxes has been reflected in these financial statements.&#160; The Predecessor has no unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31
2014.




Net
Income (Loss) Per Share


net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average common shares outstanding.&#160;
Diluted net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the
period using the treasury stock method or the two-class method
 whichever is more dilutive.&#160; As the Company incurred net losses
for the years ended December 31
 2015 (Successor) and 2014 (Predecessor)
 no potentially dilutive securities were included in the
calculation of diluted earnings per share as the impact would have been anti-dilutive.&#160; Therefore
 basic and dilutive net
income (loss) per share were the same.&#160; If the Company had net income
 potential dilutive securities consists of warrants
to purchase 1
127
000 and 875
042 shares of common stock as of December 31
 2015 (Successor) and December 31
 2014 (Predecessor)
respectively.

Tabular disclosure of warrants or rights issued. Warrants and rights outstanding are derivative securities that give the holder the right to purchase securities (usually equity) from the issuer at a specific price within a certain time frame. Warrants are often included in a new debt issue to entice investors by a higher return potential. The main difference between warrants and call options is that warrants are issued and guaranteed by the company
 whereas options are exchange instruments and are not issued by the company. Also
 the lifetime of a warrant is often measured in years
 while the lifetime of a typical option is measured in months. Disclose the title of issue of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the aggregate amount of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the date from which the warrants or rights are exercisable
 and the price at which the warrant or right is exercisable.
