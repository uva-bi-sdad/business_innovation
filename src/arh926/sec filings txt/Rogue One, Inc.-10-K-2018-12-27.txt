History

 2009. Anthus was a developer and manufacturer of natural and organic food products
packaged for consumer consumption. The Company had one product line in the natural food category. In 2013 the Company terminated
its production of products due to a lack of working capital. However as additional funds have been secured by the new management
team

888
889 to approximately 29

rounded up to the next whole share. The consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this reverse
stock split.

Discontinued
Operations

In light of
our legal proceedings involving certain former management of the Company
 we decided to discontinue our business operations of
our wholly-owned subsidiary Harvest Soul. This business was classified as discontinued operations beginning with our December
31
 2015 consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. In August 2018
 we executed a definitive agreement to sell
and transfer our equity interest in Harvest Soul.

Our results
of operations related to Harvest Soul have been reclassified as discontinued operations on a retrospective basis for all years
presented. Unless otherwise indicated
 the following discussions in this section (Item 1. Business) pertain only to our continuing
operations. For additional information see Note 3 &mdash; Discontinued Operations to our consolidated financial statements included
in this Form 10-K.

Words like
&ldquo;Natural
&rdquo; &ldquo;clean label
&rdquo; &ldquo;green
&rdquo; &ldquo;eco-friendly&rdquo;
 &ldquo;organic&rdquo;
 &ldquo;non
GMO&rdquo; and &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo; are the new buzzwords in today&rsquo;s food and beverage industry. Products and ingredients
bearing these tags have created demand among consumers
 and therefore have been significant purchase influencers. The markets
for these natural and naturally derived products are growing at a fast rate
 creating an immense profit potential for food and
beverage manufacturers. The past two decades have witnessed consumers becoming more health conscious and resorting to preventive
measures
 rather than reactionary ones. Functional foods and beverages play a major role in this segment
 promoting the concept
of healthiness-on-the-go. These functional foods and beverages include health ingredients
 which may promote general health and
well- being by preventing certain diseases. However
 the industry also confronts certain challenges in coping with the demand
of natural ingredients used in food and beverage applications
 particularly
 in terms of sustainability.

The
&ldquo;health and wellness&rdquo; mega trend drives the overall natural ingredients market. Increasing incidence of lifestyle-based
disorders
 such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)
 obesity
 osteoporosis and diabetes
 has propelled consumers to resort to natural
alternatives. Moreover
 the number of articles and newsletters circulated in media describing the ill-effects of consuming synthetic
ingredients has further cautioned consumers. Consumers perceive natural ingredients as having a positive impact on general health
while synthetic ingredients have certain detrimental effects on health. As a result
 food manufacturers have promptly responded
to the situation by completely replacing or partially replacing synthetic ingredients with their natural counterparts.

It
is becoming clearer that healthy eating is transitioning from a niche market to the mainstream. Health and wellness-focused products
are expanding rapidly
 with eight out of ten of the fastest growing food and beverage categories inextricably linked to consumer
perceptions of health. In 2013
 the market for Health &amp; Nutrition foods at retail value is estimated at $720 billion with
a CAGR of 7.4%. This constituted 24% of the total food market which had an average CAGR of 2.8%. More specifically
 the global
functional food market is expected to show a CAGR of 9.7% during 2014-2017.

This is where
the &ldquo;future value&rdquo; of the company will be derived. We will build and buy companies in the health and wellness food
and beverage space. Acquisition targets that meet our investment criteria share a number of common features:

Item 1A.
Risk Factors

Our business
is subject to numerous risks. We caution you that the following important factors
 among others
 could cause our actual results
to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC
 press
releases
 communications with investors and oral statements. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this and in any other
public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or
unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors mentioned in the discussion below will be important in determining future results.
Consequently
 no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Actual future results may vary materially from those anticipated
in forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements
 whether as a result of new
information
 future events or otherwise. You are advised
 however
 to consult any further disclosure we make in our reports filed
with the SEC.

An investment
in our Company involves a substantial risk of loss. You should carefully consider the risks described below
 before you make any
investment decision regarding our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties
 including those generally affecting the market
in which we operate or that we currently deem immaterial
 may also impair our business. If any such risks actually materialize
our business
 financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. In such case
 the trading price of our common
stock could decline.

The following
risk factors are not exhaustive and the risks discussed herein do not purport to be inclusive of all possible risks but are intended
only as examples of possible investment risks. To facilitate understanding of the various business risks applicable to our Company
and the strategic alliance companies through which we intend to operate our business during the foreseeable future
 the risk factors
discussed herein address our Company together with the risks applicable to our operations that we intend to conduct with our strategic
alliance partners.

Risks Related
to our Business and Industry

THE COMPANY
IS SUBJECT TO THE RISKS INHERENT IN A NEWLY-CREATED BUSINESS

The Company
is subject to substantially all the risks inherent in a newly-created business. As a result of its small size and capitalization
and limited operating history
 the Company is particularly susceptible to adverse effects of changing economic conditions and
consumer tastes
 competition
 and other contingencies or events beyond the control of the Company. It may be more difficult for
the Company to prepare for and respond to these types of risks and the risks described elsewhere in this Form 10-K than for a
company with an established business and operating cash flow. If the Company is not able to manage these risks successfully
 the
Company&rsquo;s operations could be negatively impacted. Due to changing circumstances
 the Company may be forced to change dramatically
or even terminate
 its planned operations.

INVESTORS
MAY LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT IF FRESH PROMISE FOODS
 INC. FAILS TO IMPLEMENT ITS BUSINESS PLAN.

The Company
expects to face substantial risks
 uncertainties
 expenses
 and difficulties because it is a development-stage company. The Company
has no demonstrable operations record of substance upon which you can evaluate the company&rsquo;s business and prospects. The
Company&rsquo;s prospects must be considered in light of the risks
 uncertainties
 expenses and difficulties frequently encountered
by companies in their early stages of development. The Company cannot guarantee that it will be successful in accomplishing its
objectives.

As of the
date of this filing the Company has had only limited start-up operations and has generated minimal revenues. Considering these
facts
 our independent auditors have raised substantial doubt about the company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern
in the independent auditors&rsquo; report to the financial statements filed with our Form 10-K. In addition
 the company&rsquo;s
lack of operating capital could negatively affect the value of its common shares and could result in the loss of your entire investment.


WE HAVE
NOT AND DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING ANY CASH DIVIDEND ON OUR COMMON STOCK AND BECAUSE OF THIS OUR SECURITIES COULD FACE DEVALUATION
IN THE MARKET.

We have paid
no cash dividends on our Common Stock to date and it is not anticipated that any cash dividends will be paid to holders of our
Common Stock in the foreseeable future. While our dividend policy will be based on the operating results and capital needs of
our business operations
 it is anticipated that any earnings will be retained to finance our business operations and future expansion.


    
    




CHANGES
IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND DISCRETIONARY SPENDING MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUE
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION.

Shifts in
consumer preferences away from our products
 our inability to develop new products that appeal to consumers
 or changes in our
product mix that eliminate items popular with some consumers could harm our business. Also
 our success depends to a significant
extent on discretionary consumer spending
 which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary
income. Accordingly
 we may experience declines in revenue during economic downturns or during periods of uncertainty. Any material
decline in the amount of discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on our sales
 results of operations
 business
and financial condition.

FLUCTUATIONS
IN VARIOUS COMMODITY
 PACKAGING AND SUPPLY COSTS
 COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS.

The prices
of the main ingredients in our offerings can be highly volatile. Supplies and prices of the various products that we use to prepare
our products can be affected by a variety of factors
 such as weather
 seasonal fluctuations
 demand
 politics and economics in
the producing countries. An increase in pricing of any major ingredients that we use in our products could have a significant
adverse effect on our profitability. In addition; higher diesel prices have
 in some cases
 resulted in the imposition of surcharges
on the delivery of commodities to distributors. Additionally
 higher diesel and gasoline prices may affect our supply costs and
may affect our sales going forward. To help mitigate the risks of volatile commodity prices and to allow greater predictability
in pricing
 we hope to enter into fixed price or to-be-fixed priced purchase commitments. We cannot assure you that these activities
will be successful or that they will not result in our paying substantially more than would have been required absent such activities.
We do not presently have any multi-year pricing agreements (with fixed processing costs)
 and none with guaranteed volume commitments.

We
may not be able to prevent others from using our intellectual property
 and may be subject to claims by third parties that we
infringe on their intellectual property.

Our products
are created using proprietary formulations; however
 we have no registered patents. Preventing and policing the unauthorized use
of our intellectual property is often difficult and any steps we take may not
 in every case
 prevent the infringement by unauthorized
third parties. Further
 there can be no assurance that our efforts to enforce our rights and protect our intellectual property
will be successful. We may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights
 which may result in substantial
costs and diversion of resources and management attention.

Further
 although
management does not believe that our products infringe on the intellectual rights of others
 there is no assurance that we will
not be the target of infringement or other claims. Such claims
 even if not true
 could result in significant legal and other
costs and may be a distraction to our management or interrupt our business.

LITIGATION
AND PUBLICITY CONCERNING PRODUCT QUALITY
 HEALTH AND OTHER ISSUES
 WHICH CAN RESULT IN LIABILITIES AND ALSO CAUSE CONSUMERS TO
AVOID OUR PRODUCTS
 WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

Beverage and
food service businesses can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from consumers or government authorities resulting
from food and beverage quality
 illness
 injury or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one retail location
or a limited number of retail locations. Adverse publicity about these allegations may negatively affect us
 regardless of whether
the allegations are true
 by discouraging consumers from buying our products. We could also incur significant liabilities
 if
a lawsuit or claim results in a decision against us
 or litigation costs
 regardless of the result.

BEVERAGE
AND FOOD SAFETY CONCERNS AND INSTANCES OF FOOD-BORNE ILLNESSES COULD HARM OUR CONSUMERS
 RESULT IN NEGATIVE PUBLICITY AND CAUSE
THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF SOME CONSUMERS&rsquo; STORES AND
 IN SOME CASES
 COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PRICE AND AVAILABILITY OF
FRUITS
 ANY OF WHICH COULD HARM OUR BRAND REPUTATION
 RESULT IN A DECLINE IN SALES OR AN INCREASE IN COSTS.

We consider
food and beverage safety a top priority and will dedicate substantial resources towards ensuring that consumers enjoy high-quality
safe and wholesome products. However
 we cannot guarantee that controls and training will be fully effective in preventing all
food-borne illnesses. Furthermore
 reliance on third-party suppliers and distributors increases the risk that food-borne illness
incidents (such as E. coli
 Hepatitis A
 Salmonella or Listeria) could occur outside of our control and at multiple locations.
We will utilize High Pressure Processing (HPP) whenever possible to mitigate these risks.

Instances
of food-borne illnesses
 whether real or perceived
 and whether at our consumers&rsquo; stores or those of our competitors
 could
harm consumers and otherwise result in negative publicity about us or the products we serve
 which could adversely affect sales.
If there is an incident involving consumers&rsquo; C-stores and other approved channels serving contaminated products
 consumers
may be harmed
 our sales may decrease and our brand name may be impaired. If consumers become ill from food-borne illnesses
 we
could be forced to temporarily suspend some operations. If we react to negative publicity by changing our products or other key
aspects of the Fresh Promise experience
 we may lose consumers who do not accept those changes
 and may not be able to attract
enough new consumers to produce the revenue needed to make our operations profitable. In addition
 we may have different or additional
competitors for our intended consumers as a result of making any such changes and may not be able to compete successfully against
those competitors. Food safety concerns and instances of food-borne illnesses and injuries caused by food contamination have in
the past
 and could in the future
 adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause consumers to
shift their preferences
 particularly if we choose to pass any higher ingredient costs along to consumers. As a result
 our costs
may increase and our sales may decline. A decrease in consumer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity
or as a result of a change in our products or smoothie experience or a temporary suspension of any of our consumer operations
could materially harm our business.


    
    


THE FOOD
SERVICE INDUSTRY HAS INHERENT OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT MAY NOT BE ADEQUATELY COVERED BY INSURANCE.

We can give
no assurance that we will be adequately insured against all risks or that our insurers will pay a particular claim. Furthermore
in the future
 we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates for our operations. We may also be
subject to calls
 or premiums
 in amounts based not only on our own claim records but also the claim records of all other members
of the protection and indemnity associations through which we may receive indemnity insurance coverage for tort liability. Our
insurance policies may also contain deductibles
 limitations and exclusions which
 although we may believe are standard in the
food service industry
 may nevertheless increase our costs.

THE PLANNED
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF STORES WHERE ARE OUR PRODUCTS WILL BE AVAILABLE MAY MAKE FUTURE RESULTS UNPREDICTABLE.

Our future
results depend on various factors
 including successful selection of new markets
 market acceptance of Fresh Promise Foods brands
consumer recognition of the quality of our products and willingness to pay our prices (which reflect our often-higher ingredient
costs
) the quality and performance of our equipment and general economic conditions. In addition
 as with the experience of other
retail food and beverage concepts who have tried to expand nationally
 we may find that the Fresh Promise Foods concept has limited
or no appeal to consumers in new markets or we may experience a decline in the popularity of our brands. Newly opened stores may
not succeed
 future markets may not be successful and average store revenue may not meet expectations.

OUR FAILURE
TO MANAGE OUR GROWTH EFFECTIVELY COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.

Our plans
call for a significant increase in the number of consumers. Product supply
 financial and management controls and information
systems may be inadequate to support our expansion. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these
systems
 procedures
 and controls and to hire
 train and retain management and staff. We may not respond quickly enough to the
changing demands that our expansion will impose on our management
 employees and existing infrastructure. We also place a lot
of importance on our culture
 which we believe will be an important contributor to our success. As we grow
 however
 we may have
difficulty maintaining our culture or adapting it sufficiently to meet the needs of our operations. Our failure to manage our
growth effectively could harm our business and operating results.

OUR OPERATING
RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY AND COULD FALL BELOW THE EXPECTATIONS OF INVESTORS DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS.

Our operating results may fluctuate
significantly because of various factors
 including:



    
1.
    
The impact of inclement
    weather
 natural disasters and other calamities
 such as earthquakes and/or hurricanes
 which could cause a delay in getting
    our products to our consumers;

    
    
    

    
    
Unseasonably cold
    or wet weather conditions could cause a delay in getting our products to our consumers;

    
    
    

    
    
Profitability of
    our operations where our products are sold
 especially in new markets;

    
    
    

    
    
Changes in comparable
    store sales and consumer visits
 including the introduction of new product items;

    
    
    

    
    
Variations in general
    economic conditions
 including those relating to changes in diesel and gasoline prices;

    
    
    

    
    
Negative publicity
    about the ingredients we use or the occurrence of food-borne illnesses or other problems at stores where our products are
    available;

    
    
    

    
    
Changes in consumer
    preferences and discretionary spending;

    
    
    

    
    
Increases in infrastructure
    costs; and

    
    
    

    
    
Fluctuation in supply
    prices.


Because of
these factors
 results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for
any year. Average consumers&rsquo; store revenue or comparable store revenue in any particular future period may decrease. In
the future
 our operating results may fall below the expectations of investors. In that event
 the value of our Common Stock or
other securities would likely decrease.

OUR CONSUMERS
AND SUPPLIERS COULD TAKE ACTIONS THAT HARM OUR REPUTATION AND REDUCE OUR PROFITS.

Consumers
and suppliers are separate entities and are not our employees. Further
 we do not exercise control over the day-to-day operations
of our consumers and suppliers. Any operational shortcomings of our consumers and suppliers are likely to be attributed to our
system-wide operations and could adversely affect our reputation and have a direct negative impact on our profits.

OUR REVENUE
IS SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY BASED ON WEATHER AND VARIES BY SEASON.

Seasonal factors
could also cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our revenue may be lower during the winter months and the holiday
season and during periods of inclement weather and higher during the spring
 summer and fall months. Our revenue will likely also
vary from quarter to quarter as a result of the number of trading days
 that is
 the number of days in a quarter when stores are
open.

    
    



WE COULD
FACE LIABILITY FROM OUR CONSUMERS
 SUPPLIERS OR GOVERNMENT.

A consumer
supplier or government agency may bring legal action against us based on the consumer/ supplier relationships. Various state and
federal laws govern our relationship with consumers and suppliers. If we fail to comply with these laws
 we could be liable for
damages to consumers or suppliers and fines or other penalties. Expensive litigation with our consumers/suppliers or government
agencies may adversely affect both our profits and our important relations with our consumer/suppliers.

WE MAY
NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS.

Developing
our business may require significant capital in the future. To meet our capital needs
 we expect to rely on our cash flow from
operations and potentially
 third-party financing. Third-party financing may not
 however
 be available on terms favorable to
us
 or at all. Our ability to obtain additional funding will be subject to various factors
 including market conditions
 our operating
performance
 lender sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with other contractual restrictions
 such
as financial covenants under our credit facility. These factors may make the timing
 amount
 terms and conditions of additional
financings unattractive. Our inability to raise capital could impede our growth.

LITIGATION
COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US BY DISTRACTING MANAGEMENT
 INCREASING OUR EXPENSES OR SUBJECTING US TO MATERIAL MONEY DAMAGES AND OTHER
REMEDIES.

Our consumers
could file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury their consumers suffered
at or after a visit to their stores
 or that we have problems with food quality or operations. We are also subject to a variety
of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business
 including personal injury claims
 contract claims and claims alleging
violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters
 discrimination and similar matters
 and we could
become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters in the future. Regardless of whether any
claims against us are valid
 or whether we are ultimately held liable
 claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and
money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any
claims could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting
from these allegations may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects
 which in turn could adversely affect
our results. The food and beverage services industry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content
of food products they sell and disclosure and advertising practices.

WE MAY
ALSO INCUR COSTS RESULTING FROM OTHER SECURITY RISKS WE MAY FACE IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ELECTRONIC PROCESSING AND TRANSMISSION
OF CONFIDENTIAL CONSUMER INFORMATION.

We rely on
commercially available software and other technologies to provide security for processing and transmission of consumer credit
card data. Our systems could be compromised in the future
 which could result in the misappropriation of consumer information
or the disruption of systems. Either of those consequences could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business
or subject it to additional liabilities.

WE ARE
EXPOSED TO INCREASED COSTS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPLIANCE WITH CHANGING LAWS
 REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS IN GENERAL
 AND
SPECIFICALLY WITH INCREASED AND NEW REGULATION OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND DISCLOSURE STANDARDS.

We expect
to spend an increased amount of management time and external resources to comply with existing and changing laws
 regulations
and standards in general
 and specifically relating to corporate governance. In particular
 Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 requires management to annually review and evaluate all of our internal control systems
 and file attestations of
the effectiveness of these systems by our management and by our independent auditors. This process may require us to hire additional
personnel and use outside advisory services and result in additional accounting and legal expenses. If in the future our chief
executive officer
 chief financial officer or independent auditors determine that our controls over financial reporting are not
effective as defined under Section 404
 investor perceptions may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the value
of our stock. If our independent auditors are unable to provide an unqualified attestation of management&rsquo;s assessment of
our internal control over financial reporting
 or disclaim an ability to issue an attestation
 it could result in a loss of investor
confidence in our financial reports
 adversely affect our stock value and our ability to access the capital markets or borrow
money. Failure to comply with other existing and changing laws
 regulations and standards could also adversely affect the Company.

THE REPORT
OF OUR INDEPENDENT AUDITORS INDICATES UNCERTAINTY CONCERNING OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN AND THIS MAY IMPAIR OUR
ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL TO FUND OUR BUSINESS PLAN.

Our independent
auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We cannot assure you that this will not
impair our ability to raise capital on attractive terms. Additionally
 we cannot assure you that we will ever achieve significant
revenues and therefore remain a going concern.

COMPETITORS
WITH MORE RESOURCES MAY FORCE US OUT OF BUSINESS.

We will compete
with many well-established companies
 food and beverage service
 C-stores and other approved channels and otherwise
 on the basis
of taste
 quality and price of product offered
 consumer service
 atmosphere
 location and overall guest experience. Aggressive
pricing by our competitors or the entrance of new competitors into our markets could reduce our revenue and profit margins.

    
    



WE MAY
NOT BE ABLE TO ATTAIN PROFITABILITY WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING
 WHICH MAY BE UNAVAILABLE.

The Company
has limited capital resources. To date
 the Company has funded its operations from limited funding and has not generated sufficient
cash from operations to be profitable or to maintain sufficient inventory. Unless the Company begins to generate sufficient revenues
to finance operations as a going concern
 the Company may experience liquidity and solvency problems. Such liquidity and solvency
problems may force the Company to cease operations if additional financing is not available.

THE COST
TO MEET OUR REPORTING AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS AS A PUBLIC COMPANY SUBECT TO THE EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 WILL BE SUBSTANTIAL AND MAY
RESULT IN US HAVING INSUFFICIENT FUNDS TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS OR EVEN MEET ROUTINE BUSINESS OBLIGATIONS.

Subject to
the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934
 we will incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting
legal
 and a host of other expenses for annual reports and proxy statements.

WE MAY
HAVE DIFFICULTY IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING MANAGEMENT AND OUTSIDE INDEPENDENT MEMBERS TO OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AS A RESULT OF
THEIR CONCERNS RELATING TO THEIR INCREASED PERSONAL EXPOSURE TO LAWSUITS AND STOCKHOLDER CLAIMS BY VIRTUE OF HOLDING THESE POSITIONS
IN A PUBLICLY-HELD COMPANY.

The directors
and management of publicly-traded corporations are increasingly concerned with the extent of their personal exposure to lawsuits
and stockholder claims
 as well as governmental and creditor claims which may be made against them
 particularly in view of recent
changes in securities laws imposing additional duties
 obligations and liabilities on management and directors. Due to these perceived
risks
 directors and management are also becoming increasingly concerned with the availability of directors&rsquo; and officers&rsquo;
liability insurance to pay on a timely basis the costs incurred in defending such claims. We currently do not carry directors&rsquo;
and officers&rsquo; liability insurance. Directors&rsquo; and officers&rsquo; liability insurance has recently become much more
expensive and difficult to obtain. If we are unable to provide directors&rsquo; and officers&rsquo; liability insurance at affordable
rates or at all
 it may become increasingly more difficult to attract and retain qualified outside directors to serve on our board
of directors.

We may lose
potential independent board members and management candidates to other companies that have greater directors&rsquo; and officers&rsquo;
liability insurance to insure them from liability or to companies that have revenues or have received greater funding to date
which can offer more lucrative compensation packages. The fees of directors are also rising in response to their increased duties
obligations and liabilities as well as increased exposure to such risks. As a company with a limited operating history and limited
resources
 we will have a more difficult time attracting and retaining management and outside independent directors than a more
established company due to these enhanced duties
 obligations and liabilities.

WE MAY
NOT ACHIEVE RESULTS SIMILAR TO THE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS.

Projections
and estimated financial results are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and
 though considered reasonable
by us
 are subject to significant business
 economic
 and competitive uncertainties and contingencies
 all of which are difficult
to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly
 there can be no assurance that the projected results will be
realized or that actual results will not be significantly lower than projected. Neither we nor any other person or entity assumes
any responsibility for the accuracy or validity of the projections.

Risks Related
to an Investment in our Common Stock

OUR DIRECTORS
HAVE THE RIGHT TO AUTHORIZE THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR PREFERRED STOCK.

Our directors
within the limitations and restrictions contained in our articles of incorporation and without further action by our stockholders
have the authority to issue shares of preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and to fix the number of shares
and the relative rights
 conversion rights
 voting rights
 and terms of redemption
 liquidation preferences and any other preferences
special rights and qualifications of any such series. Any issuance of shares of preferred stock could adversely affect the rights
of holders of our common stock.

IF THERE
IS A MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES IN THE FUTURE
 OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE AND ILLIQUID.

We can make
no assurance that there will be a public market for our common Stock in the future. If there is a market for our Common Stock
in the future
 we anticipate that such market may be illiquid and might be subject to wide fluctuations in response to several
factors
 including
 but not limited to the following factors:



    
(1)
    
actual or anticipated
    variations in our results of operations;

    
    
    

    
    
our ability or inability
    to generate new revenue;

    
    
    

    
    
our ability to anticipate
    and effectively adapt to a developing market;

    
    
    

    
    
our ability to attract
    retain and motivate qualified personnel;

    
    
    

    
    
consumer satisfaction
    and loyalty;

    
    
    

    
    
increased competition;
    and

    
    
    

    
    
conditions and trends
    in the market for organic and natural products.




    
    

CONVERSION
OF OUR PROMISSORY NOTES OR SALES OF A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK INTO THE PUBLIC MARKET BY SELLING SHAREHOLDERS
MAY CAUSE A REDUCTION IN THE PRICE OF OUR STOCK AND PURCHASERS WHO ACQUIRE SHARES FROM THE SELLING SHAREHOLDERS MAY LOSE SOME
OR ALL OF THEIR INVESTMENTS.

If a market
for our shares develops
 sales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock in the public market could cause a reduction
in the price of our Common Stock. If selling Shareholders resell a substantial portion of the issued and outstanding shares of
our Common Stock it could have an adverse effect on the price of our Common Stock. As a result of any such decreases in the price
of our Common Stock
 purchasers who acquire shares from Selling Shareholders may lose some or all of their investment.

OUR EXISTING
SHAREHOLDERS WILL EXPERIENCE DILUTION.

We will need
to raise additional funds
 and these funds may not be available on favorable terms
 or at all. Furthermore
 if we issue equity
or debt securities to raise additional funds
 our existing shareholders will experience dilution
 and the new equity or debt securities
may have rights
 preference
 and privileges senior to those of our existing shareholders. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable
terms
 we may not be able to develop or enhance our products
 execute our business plan
 take advantage of future opportunities
or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated consumer requirements.

There is no
assurance that we will be profitable
 and we may not be able to successfully develop
 manage or market our products and services.
We may not be able to attract or retain qualified executives and technological personnel and our products and services may become
obsolete. Government regulation may hinder our business. Additional dilution in outstanding stock ownership will be incurred due
to the issuance of more shares
 stock options
 or the exercise of stock options
 and other risks inherent in our business.

Currently
there is a public market for our securities
 but there can be no assurances that the public market will develop further and
 if
developed further
 it is likely to experience significant price fluctuations.

We have a
trading symbol for our common stock
 namely &lsquo;FPFI&rsquo;. There can be no assurances as to whether:



    
    
the market for our
    shares will continue to develop; or

    
    
    

    
    
the prices at which
    our common stock will trade;


Prices for
our common stock will be determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors
 including the depth and liquidity
of the market for shares of our common stock
 developments affecting our business
 including the impact of the factors referred
to elsewhere in these risk factors
 investor perception of our Company and general economic and market conditions.

We
are subject to the penny stock rules which will make our securities more difficult to sell.

We are subject
to the SEC&rsquo;s &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules because our securities sell below $5.00 per share. The penny stock rules require
broker-dealers to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks
and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid
and offer quotations for the penny stock
 the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson
 and monthly account statements
showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer&rsquo;s account. In addition
 the bid and offer quotations
and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to completing
the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer&rsquo;s confirmation.

Furthermore
the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction
 the broker dealer must make a special written determination that the
penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser&rsquo;s written agreement to the transaction.
The penny stock rules are burdensome and may reduce purchases of any offerings and reduce the trading activity for our securities.
As long as our securities are subject to the penny stock rules
 the holders of such securities will find it more difficult to
sell their securities.

We
are not likely to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

We currently
intend to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. Accordingly
 we do not expect to
pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future
 but will review this policy as circumstances dictate.

SHARES
ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE BY OUR CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE.

The sale of
a significant number of shares of common stock at any particular time could be difficult to achieve at the market prices prevailing
immediately before such shares are offered. In addition
 sales of substantial amounts of common stock
 including shares issued
upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants
 under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 144 or otherwise could adversely
affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital at that time through the
sale of our securities.

    
    



THERE IS
A NEED FOR ANY GOVERNMENTAL APPROVAL OF OUR PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS.

Companies
have been the target of class action lawsuits and other proceedings alleging
 among other things
 violations of federal and state
workplace and employment laws. Proceedings of this nature
 if successful
 could result in our payment of substantial damages.

Our results
of operations may be adversely affected by legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of employees or consumers.
In recent years
 a number of companies
 including juice companies
 have been subject to lawsuits
 including class action lawsuits
alleging violations of federal and state law. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial awards by
the defendants. Although we are not currently a party to any material class action lawsuits
 we could incur substantial damages
and expenses resulting from lawsuits
 which would increase the cost of operating the business and decrease the cash available
for other uses.

WE ARE
SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REGULATION.

We are subject
to various federal
 state and local regulations. Our products are subject to state and local regulation by health
 sanitation
food and workplace safety and other agencies. We may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses
or approvals for new products which could delay planned execution of our business plan. We are subject to the U.S. Americans with
Disabilities Act and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of
employment
 public accommodations and other areas. We may in the future have to modify office and warehouse space
 for example
by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures
 to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations
for disabled persons. The expenses associated with these modifications could be material. Our operations are also subject to the
U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act
 which governs such matters as minimum wages
 overtime and other working conditions
 along with
the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act
 family leave mandates and a variety of similar laws enacted by the states that govern
these and other employment law matters. In addition
 federal proposals to introduce a system of mandated health insurance and
flexible work time and other similar initiatives could
 if implemented
 adversely affect our operations. In recent years
 there
has been an increased legislative
 regulatory and consumer focus on nutrition and advertising practices in the food industry.
As a result
 we may in the future become subject to initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising
 such as requirements
to provide information about the nutritional content of our products
 which could increase our expenses.

AS A PUBLIC
COMPANY
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO COMPLEX LEGAL AND ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS THAT WILL REQUIRE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES AND WILL
EXPOSE US TO RISK OF NON-COMPLIANCE.

As a public
company
 we are subject to numerous legal and accounting requirements that do not apply to private companies. The cost of compliance
with many of these requirements is material
 not only in absolute terms but
 more importantly
 in relation to the overall scope
of the operations of a small company. Our relative inexperience with these requirements may increase the cost of compliance and
may also increase the risk that we will fail to comply.

Failure to
comply with these requirements can have numerous adverse consequences including
 but not limited to
 our inability to file required
periodic reports on a timely basis
 loss of market confidence and/or governmental or private actions against us. We cannot assure
you that we will be able to comply with all of these requirements or that the cost of such compliance will not prove to be a substantial
competitive disadvantage vis-&agrave;-vis our privately held and larger public competitors.

WE MAY
BE SUBJECT TO SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION
 THEREBY DIVERTING OUR RESOURCES THAT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR PROFITABILITY AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

As discussed
in the preceding risk factors
 the market for our common shares is characterized by significant price volatility when compared
to seasoned issuers
 and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite
future. In the past
 plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of
volatility in the market price of its securities. We may become the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation will result
in substantial costs and liabilities and will divert management&rsquo;s attention and resources.

&rdquo; &ldquo;expects
&rdquo; &ldquo;anticipates
&rdquo; &ldquo;intends
&rdquo;
&ldquo;plans
&rdquo; &ldquo;estimates&rdquo; or similar expressions.

Forward-looking
statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
expressed in these forward-looking statements
 including the risks and uncertainties described below and other factors we describe
from time to time in our periodic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;SEC&rdquo;). We therefore
caution you not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this report speak only as
of the date of this report
 and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement
 whether as a result
of new information
 future developments or otherwise.

Management&rsquo;s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This Annual
report on Form 10-K and other reports filed by Fresh Promise Foods
 Inc. (&ldquo;we
&rdquo; &ldquo;us
&rdquo; &ldquo;our
&rdquo;
or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) contain
or may contain forward-looking statements (collectively the &ldquo;Filings&rdquo;) and information that are based upon beliefs
of
 and information currently available to
 the Company&rsquo;s management as well as estimates and assumptions made by Company&rsquo;s
management. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements
 which are only predictions
and speak only as of the date hereof. When used in the Filings
 the words &ldquo;anticipate&rdquo;
 &ldquo;believe&rdquo;
 &ldquo;estimate&rdquo;
&ldquo;expect&rdquo;
 &ldquo;future&rdquo;
 &ldquo;intend&rdquo;
 &ldquo;plan&rdquo;
 or the negative of these terms and similar
expressions as they relate to the Company or the Company&rsquo;s management identify forward-looking statements. Such statements
reflect the current view of the Company with respect to future events and are subject to risks
 uncertainties
 assumptions
 and
other factors. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize
 or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect
actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated
 believed
 estimated
 expected
 intended
 or planned.

Although the
Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable
 the Company cannot guarantee
future results
 levels of activity
 performance
 or achievements. Except as required by applicable law
 including the securities
laws of the United States
 the Company does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements
to actual results.

Our financial
statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;).
These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates
 judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates
 judgments
and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates
 judgments
and assumptions are made. These estimates
 judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
Our financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results.
In many cases
 the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management&rsquo;s
judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management&rsquo;s judgment in selecting any available alternative
would not produce a materially different result. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements
and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.

    
    



Results
of Operations for the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015



We did not
record any revenues for the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015. As discussed above
 we discontinued our operating subsidiary
Harvest Soul; which had been our sole source for sales revenue in prior periods. We are contemplating various opportunities as
a means to generate future sales revenue; however
 we can provide no assurance that our efforts will successfully result in any
new revenues.

Gross
Margin

Gross margin
is calculated by subtracting cost of sales from revenue. Gross margin percentage is calculated by dividing gross margins by revenue.

We did not
record any cost of goods sold for either of the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015. As such
 we did not realize any gross
margin for either of the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015.

Operating
Expenses

We did not
incur any operating expenses from continuing operations for the year ended December 31
 2016
 compared to $49
771 in operating
expenses from continuing operations for the year ended December 31
 2015.

The primary
components of our operating expenses include professional fees
 investor relations activities
 and various administrative and
office expenses. The material decrease in our operating expenses is attributable to the effective suspension of operations experienced
at the corporate level resulting from the legal matter described throughout this report involving current and former management.
We expect our operating expenses to increase proportionally to our business activities as we begin to execute upon our Plan of
Operations in future periods.

Other
Income (Expense)

Net other
expenses totaled $258
062 for the year ended December 31
 2016
 compared to $718
068 in net other expenses for the year ended
December 31
 2015.

The Company
issues convertible notes to finance operations. Some notes have embedded derivative features. The value of these instruments fluctuate
as the trading price of our common stock changes. During 2016
 we experienced a non-cash gain of $81
934 from the decline in value
of these derivative features. This compares to a non-cash gain of $870
439 from the decline in value of these derivative liabilities
in 2015. During 2015
 we incurred a non-cash expense of $742
709 in conjunction with the issuance of these notes. We did not incur
any such expense in 2016.

In 2016
 we
recorded interest expense related to the amortization of debt discounts totaling $265
263 a decrease of $443
790 from 2015. Our
other interest expenses decreased by $72
012
 from $146
745 in 2015 to $74
733 in 2016. This decrease was the result of the conversion
of certain interest bearing convertible promissory notes into common stock of the Company.

Net
loss from continuing operations

We incurred
a net loss from continuing operations of $258
062
 or $0.00 per share
 for the year ended December 31
 2016
 compared to a net
loss of $767
839
 or $0.00 per share
 for the year ended December 31
 2015.

The weighted
average number of basic and fully diluted shares outstanding for the year ended December 31
 2016 was 829
919
771 compared to
321
224
450 for the year ended December 31
 2015. There are no dilutive equivalents included in our calculation of fully diluted
shares for the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015
 since their inclusion would be anti-dilutive due to our net loss per share.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates
 among
other things
 the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.

The Company
sustained a net loss of $421
214 for the year ended December 31
 2016 and a net loss of $1
855
849 for the year ended December
31
 2015. Because of the absence of positive cash flows from operations
 the Company requires additional funding to execute upon
its Plan of Operation. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

We are presently
unable to meet our obligations as they come due. At December 31
 2016
 we had no assets and a working capital deficit of $3
607
005.
Our working capital deficit is largely due to the increase in our convertible notes payable.

Net cash used
in operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31
 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $177
849
 respectively.
Net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations primarily includes our net loss
 offset by the amortization of
debt discounts
 derivative expenses and the change in the value of derivative liabilities.

Net
cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31
 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $367
978
respectively. Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations primarily includes our net loss
 offset by an
impairment charge to the assets associated with our discontinued business
 the amortization of debt discounts
 derivative expenses
and the change in the value of derivative liabilities.&nbsp;



    
    


Net cash provided
by financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31
 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $404
164
 respectively.
Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31
 2015 was solely from the
issuance of convertible promissory notes.

Net cash provided
by financing activities from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31
 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $140
000
 respectively.
Net cash provided by financing activities from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31
 2015 was solely from the
issuance of convertible promissory notes.


We anticipate
that our cash requirements will arise from the need to fund our growth from operations
 pay current obligations and future capital
expenditures. The primary sources of funding in the near term for such requirements are expected to be cash generated from raising
additional funds by the issuance of convertible notes. However
 we can provide no assurances that we will be able to generate
sufficient cash flow or obtain additional financing on terms satisfactory to us
 if at all
 to remain a going concern. Our continuation
as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis and
ultimately to attain profitability. In addition
 our Plan of Operation for the next twelve months is to raise capital to continue
to expand our operations. We are presently engaged in capital raising activities through one or more private offering of our company&rsquo;s
securities. See &ldquo;Note 2&ndash; Going Concern&rdquo; in our financial statements for additional information as to the possibility
that we may not be able to continue as a &ldquo;going concern.&rdquo;

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

We do not
have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition
 changes in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures or capital
resources that is material to investors.

Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We do not
hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in any hedging activities.

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



To the
shareholders and the board of directors of Fresh Promise Foods
 Inc.
Opinion
on the Financial Statements
We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fresh Promise Foods
 Inc. as of December 31
 2016 and 2015
 the related
statements of operations
 stockholders' equity (deficit)
 and cash flows for the years then ended
 and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the &quot;financial statements&quot;). In our opinion
 the financial statements present fairly
 in all material
respects
 the financial position of the Company as of December 31
 2016 and 2015
 and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the years then ended
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Basis
for Opinion
These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (&quot;PCAOB&quot;) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the
U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted
our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error or fraud.
Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to
error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Substantial
Doubt about the Company&rsquo;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the financial statements
 the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated
deficit. In addition
 the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described
in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

FRESH PROMISE
FOODS
 INC.
NOTES TO
THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years Ended
December 31
 2016 and 2015

NOTE 1 &ndash; NATURE OF BUSINESS
AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



Fresh Promise
Foods
 Inc. (&ldquo;Fresh Promise&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) is a consumer products and marketing company focused on
the high-margin
 multi-billion dollar health and wellness food and beverage sectors.

Effective
January 20
 2015
 the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) effected in the marketplace a 1-for-150 reverse stock split
for the common stock of Fresh Promise. On December 30
 2014
 the Company filed with the Nevada Secretary of State a Certificate
of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with respect to such 1-for-150 reverse stock split. All share and per share have
been presented to give retroactive effective for this reverse stock split.

Going
Concern

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates
realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the twelve-month period following
the date of these financial statements. On a consolidated basis
 the Company has incurred significant operating losses since its
inception.

Because the
Company does not expect that existing operational cash flow will be sufficient to fund presently anticipated operations
 this
raises substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore
 the Company will need to
raise additional funds and is currently exploring alternative sources of financing. Historically
 the Company has raised capital
through the issuance of convertible debt as a measure to finance working capital needs. The Company will be required to continue
to do so until such time that its consolidated operations become profitable.

Discontinued
Operations

In light of
the Company&rsquo;s legal proceedings involving certain former management
 Fresh Promise decided to discontinue its business operations
of its wholly-owned subsidiary Harvest Soul. This business was classified as discontinued operations beginning with the Company&rsquo;s
December 31
 2015 consolidated financial statements. In August 2018
 Fresh Promise executed a definitive agreement to sell and
transfer its equity interest in Harvest Soul.

The Company&rsquo;s
results of operations related to Harvest Soul have been reclassified as discontinued operations on a retrospective basis for all
years presented. For additional information see Note 3 &mdash; Discontinued Operations.

Basis
of Presentation

The Company
uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&ldquo;US GAAP&rdquo;).
The Company has adopted a December 31 fiscal year end.

The consolidated
financial statements include the financial statements of Fresh Promise Foods Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary Harvest Soul
Inc. All significant inter-company balances and transactions within the Company and subsidiary have been eliminated upon consolidation.



The preparation of consolidated
financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience
 known
or expected trends and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable given the quality of information available
as of the date of these financial statements. The results of these assumptions provide the basis for making estimates about the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from
these estimates.



Fresh Promise
Foods Inc. considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company
places its cash with a high credit quality financial institution. The Company&rsquo;s account at this institution is insured by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&ldquo;FDIC&rdquo;) up to $250
000. For the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015
the Company has not reached bank balances exceeding the FDIC insurance limit. To reduce its risk associated with the failure of
such financial institution
 the Company evaluates at least annually the rating of the financial institution in which it holds
deposits.

    
    



Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The Company&rsquo;s
financial instruments are carried at the approximate fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate
prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these consolidated financial statements.

Net
Income (Loss) per Common Share

Net income
(loss) per share is calculated in accordance with FASB ASC 260
 &ldquo;Earnings per Share.&rdquo; Basic net income (loss) per
common share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding at December 31
 2016 and 2015. Diluted
earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Company&rsquo;s net loss available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted
average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted
number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. At December 31
 2016 and 2015
 the Company had convertible
notes outstanding that could be converted into approximately 12
579
757
236 and 18
178
047
136 common shares based up the closing
bid price of the company&rsquo;s common stock at December 31
 2016 and 2015
 respectively. Shares which would result from the
conversion of the convertible notes were excluded from the calculation of net loss per share for 2016 and 2015 because the effect
would be anti-dilutive.



ASC 718
 Compensation
&ndash; Stock Compensation
 prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee
services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities
 or issuing or offering to issue shares
 options
 and other
equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees
 including
grants of employee stock options
 are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values.
That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award
known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period).

The Company
accounts for stock-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50
Equity &ndash; Based Payments to Non-Employees. Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on
the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued.
The fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance
completion date.

No share-based
expenses were recorded for the twelve months ended December 31
 2016 and 2015.

Income
Taxes

The Company
accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740-10
 &ldquo;Accounting for Income Taxes
&rdquo; which requires
among other things
 an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires
the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities

A valuation
allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the
net deferred asset will not be realized.

The Company
follows the provisions of the ASC 740 -10 related to
 Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions. When tax returns are filed
it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities
 while others are
subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10
 the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the
period during which
 based on all available evidence
 management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained upon examination
 including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes
 if any. Tax positions taken are not offset
or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the
largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing
authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above
should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest
and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions will be
highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such
 the Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits.

The Company
has adopted ASC 740-10-25 Definition of Settlement
 which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position
is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can
be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax
positions considered effectively settled
 an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit
 even if the tax position is
not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations
remains open. Management has not filed tax returns for the years ended December 31
 2014 through 2017. The tax year 2013 remains
open for examination.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

Except for
rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws and a limited number of grandfathered standards
the FASB Accounting Standards Codification&trade; (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) is the sole source of authoritative GAAP literature recognized
by the FASB and applicable to the Company. Management has reviewed the aforementioned rules and releases and believes any effect
will not have a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s present or future financial statements.

    
    



NOTE 2
&ndash; GOING CONCERN

The Company&rsquo;s
consolidated financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course
of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating cost and allow
it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining
adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital
 it
could be forced to cease operations.

The Company
incurred net losses of $421
214 and $1
855
849 for the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015
 respectively
 and the Company had
accumulated deficits of $11
033
129 and $10
611
915 and working capital deficits of $3
607
005 and $3
185
791 at December 31
2016 and 2015
 respectively. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going
concern.

In order to
continue as a going concern
 the Company will need
 among other things
 additional capital resources. Management&rsquo;s plan
to obtain such resources for the Company include
 obtaining debt or equity capital from various lenders
 institutions and significant
stockholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses. However
 management cannot provide any assurance that the Company
will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.

There is no
assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed or that such funds
 if available
 will
be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. In addition
 profitability will ultimately depend upon the level of revenues
received from business operations. However
 there is no assurance that the Company will attain profitability. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue
as a going concern.

NOTE 3
&ndash; DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In light of
the Company&rsquo;s legal proceedings involving certain former management
 Fresh Promise decided to discontinue its business operations
of its wholly-owned subsidiary Harvest Soul. This business was classified as discontinued operations beginning with the Company&rsquo;s
December 31
 2015 consolidated financial statements.

The Company
made the decision to impair all of the assets of Harvest Soul resulting in a charge of $217
728. The decision to impair the assets
was made as Harvest Soul was operating autonomously during the legal proceedings
 and the Company determined that the assets presented
it with no future economic benefit. The impairment charge is reflected under operating expenses in the operating results from
discontinued operations summarized below.

Effective
August 28
 2018
 the Company executed an assignment and assumption agreement with Harvest Soul
 LLC (the &ldquo;Purchaser&rdquo;)
providing for the sale of certain assets and the assignment of certain (i) notes payable
 (ii) accrued salaries and (iii) contracts
(collectively the &ldquo;Assumed Liabilities&rdquo;) to Purchaser and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by the Purchaser.

The operating
results of the Company&rsquo;s Harvest Soul subsidiary classified as discontinued operations are summarized below:

During the
year ended December 31
 2015
 the Company received debt proceeds from the issuance of five convertible promissory notes aggregating
$99
500 to certain lenders. The Company has attempted with no avail to locate these note agreements and validate the sources of
these debt proceeds. It has exhausted all of its available resources in its efforts to locate these notes and note holders. As
such
 the Company has made certain assumptions in regards to the contractual terms associated with these notes
 which are consistent
with other convertible debt securities issued during the period.

As of December
31
 2016
 the majority of the Company&rsquo;s convertible promissory notes were in default of payment per the terms of their contractual
maturity dates. To the best of its knowledge
 the Company has not received any formal notices of default
 demands for payment
or other forms of claim as a result of these defaults.

All of the
convertible notes were analyzed at the time of their issuance for derivative accounting consideration. In some instances
 the
Company concluded that a derivative liability existed. The derivative liabilities were measured using the commitment-date stock
price. As of December 31
 2016 and 2015
 the Company determined that the fair value of these derivative liabilities totaled $1
090
696
and $1
172
631
 respectively.

The value
of the derivative liabilities was determined using the following Black-Scholes methodology:

The Company has no history
    or expectation of paying cash dividends on its common stock.

    
The risk-free interest rate is based on the
    U.S. Treasury yield for a term consistent with the expected life of the promissory notes in effect at the time of issuance.

    
The volatility of the Company&rsquo;s common
    stock is based on trading activity for the previous contractual term ended at each promissory note issuance date.




    
    

A portion
of this amount is recorded as a debt discount and is amortized as interest expense over the term of the related convertible debentures.
The remaining debt discounts associated with these beneficial conversion features was $0 and $265
264 as of December 31
 2016
and 2015
 respectively. The related amortization expense was $265
264 and $669
053 for the year ended December 31
 2016 and 2015
respectively. See Note 8 &ndash; Fair Value Measurements for additional details.

During the
year ended December 31
 2015
 the Company converted
 upon receiving formal notices from its noteholders
 $278
198 in note principal
plus accrued interest totaling $12
612
 into 822
764
082 shares of common stock.

At December
31
 2016
 the number of shares of common stock underlying these convertible debentures totaled 12
579
757
236 shares.

NOTE 6
&ndash; STOCKHOLDERS&rsquo; EQUITY (DEFICIT)

At&nbsp;December 31
 2016 and 2015
the Company had 10
000
000 shares of its Series A preferred stock issued and outstanding. The majority of the Series A preferred
stock entitles the stockholders to 67% overall voting rights.


Series
B Preferred Stock

Each one share
of Series B Preferred has voting rights equal to four times the sum of all shares of common stock issued and outstanding at time
of voting
 plus all shares of Series C Preferred Stock issued and outstanding at time of voting
 divided by the number of shares
of Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding at the time of voting.

By unanimous
written consent of the Board during 2013
 the Board issued an aggregate of two (2) shares of Series B Preferred
 to two individuals
(the &ldquo;Series B Stockholders&rdquo;). As a result of the voting rights granted to the Series B Preferred
 the Series B Stockholders
together held in the aggregate approximately 80% of the total voting power of all issued and outstanding voting capital of the
Company.

Effective
for the year ending December 31
 2015
 these outstanding shares of Series B preferred stock were rescinded by the Company. This
series was issued without proper shareholder approval and notification.

Series
C Preferred Stock

Series C Preferred
Stock has voting rights of one vote per share owned. The Preferred C stock is convertible into common stock of the Company at
the rate of 0.10 per common share for each share of Preferred C stock. The holders of Series C Preferred stock are entitled to
receive any dividend declared by the Board of Directors.

Effective
for the year ending December 31
 2015

222 warrants expired.
These warrants were issued in 2013
 and represented the only outstanding warrants granted by the Company. There were no outstanding
warrants at December 31
 2016 or 2015. &nbsp;

NOTE 7
&ndash; INCOME TAXES

As of December
31
 2016
 the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $11.0 million that may be available to reduce our
tax liability through tax year 2036. We estimate the benefits of this loss carry forward at $2
316
957 if the Company produces
sufficient taxable income. No adjustments to the financial statements have been recorded for this potential tax benefit.&nbsp;The
Company has no provisions from income tax in 2016
 due to current period losses and full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.

NOTE 8
&ndash; FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company
has adopted the guidance under ASC Topic 820 for financial instruments measured on a fair value on a recurring basis. ASC Topic
820 establishes a fair value hierarchy
 giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority
to unobservable data and requires disclosures for assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on their level in the hierarchy.
Further authoritative accounting guidance (ASU No. 2009-05) under ASC Topic 820
 provides clarification that in circumstances
in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liabilities is not available
 a reporting entity is required to
measure fair value using one or more of the techniques provided for in this update.

The standard
describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of input
 of which the first two are considered observable and the last
unobservable
 that may be used to measure fair value
 which are the following:

Level 1 &ndash;
Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

Level 2 &ndash;
Input other than Level 1 that are observable
 either directly or indirectly
 such as quoted prices for similar assets of liabilities;
quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market
data for substantially the full term of the asset or liabilities.

Level 3 &ndash;
Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets
or liabilities.

    
    



Our assessment
of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment
 and considers factors
specific to the asset or liability.

The Company
analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under ASC 480
 &ldquo;Distinguishing Liabilities
from Equity&rdquo; and ASC 815
 &ldquo;Derivatives and Hedging&rdquo;. Derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value
at each period end
 with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as adjustments to
fair value of derivatives. The effects of interactions between embedded derivatives are calculated and accounted for in arriving
at the over- all fair value of the financial instruments. In addition
 the fair value of free-standing derivative instruments
such as warrant and option derivatives are valued using the Black-Scholes modes.

The Company
uses Level 3 inputs for its valuation methodology for the embedded conversion option liabilities as their fair value were determined
by using the Black Scholes option-pricing model based on various assumptions. The Company&rsquo;s derivative liabilities are adjusted
to reflect fair value at each period end
 with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations
as adjustments to fair value of derivatives.

Item 9.
Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants and Financial Disclosure

Effective
May 1
 2018
 the Company dismissed D&rsquo;Arelli Pruzansky
 P.A. as its independent registered public accounting firm and engaged
BF Borgers CPA PC as its independent registered public accounting firm. D&rsquo;Arelli Pruzansky
 P.A. audited our financial statements
for the periods ended December 31
 2014 and December 31
 2013 and reviewed the financials prepared by the previous public accounting
firm for the period ended December 31
 2012. The dismissal of D&rsquo;Arelli Pruzansky
 P.A. was approved by our Board of Directors
effective May 1
 2018. D&rsquo;Arelli Pruzansky
 P.A. did not resign or decline to stand for re-election.

Neither the
report of D&rsquo;Arelli Pruzansky
 P.A. dated April 24
 2015 on our balance sheets as of December 31
 2014 and 2013 and the related
statements of operations
 stockholders&rsquo; equity (deficit)
 and cash flows for the years ended December 31
 2014 and 2013
nor the report of D&rsquo;Arelli Pruzansky
 P.A. dated April 15
 2014 on our balance sheets as of December 31
 2013 and 2012 and
the related statements of operations
 stockholders&rsquo; equity (deficit)
 and cash flows for the years ended December 31
 2013
and 2012 contained an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion
 nor was either such report qualified or modified as to uncertainty
audit scope
 or accounting principles
 except that both such reports raised substantial doubts on our ability to continue as a
going concern.

During our
two most recent fiscal years and the subsequent interim period preceding our decision to dismiss D&rsquo;Arelli Pruzansky
 P.A.
we had no disagreements with the firm on any matter of accounting principles or practices
 financial statement disclosure
 or
auditing scope of procedure which disagreement if not resolved to the satisfaction of D&rsquo;Arelli Pruzansky
 P.A. would have
caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its report.

During our
two most recent fiscal years and the subsequent interim period prior to retaining BF Borgers CPA PC (1) neither we nor anyone

Item 9A.
Controls and Procedures

(a) Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management
with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &ldquo;Exchange
Act&rdquo;))
 in connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 as of December 31
 2016.

Based on the
review described above
 our Chief Executive Officer determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of the end of the period covered by this report.

(b) Management&rsquo;s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were
no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred subsequent to our evaluation of our internal
control over financial reporting for the period ended December 31
 2016 that has materially affected
 or is reasonably likely
to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

    
    



Our Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting under the supervision of the
President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. Internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Management
evaluated the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2016
 based on the framework
and criteria established in Internal Control &ndash; Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in May 2013
 and has concluded that such internal control over financial reporting were not
effective.

An evaluation
was performed
 under the supervision of
 and with the participation of
 our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer
 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-(e) to the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation
 our management
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
not adequate and effective
 as of December 31
 2016
 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 is recorded
 processed
 summarized
 and reported within the
time periods specified in the Commission&rsquo;s rules and forms
 and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 as appropriate
 to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

We do not
expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all
fraud. A control system
 no matter how well conceived and operated
 can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives
of the system are met and cannot detect all deviations. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation
of control can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or deviations
 if any
 within the Company
have been detected.

This report
does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
Management&rsquo;s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules
of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the company to provide only management&rsquo;s report in this report.
