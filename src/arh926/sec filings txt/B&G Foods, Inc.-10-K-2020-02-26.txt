The food industry is one of the United States&#8217; largest industries. Historically
 it has been characterized by relatively stable sales growth
 based largely on price and population increases. In recent years
 however
 many traditional center of store grocery brands in the industry have often experienced flat to modestly declining sales. Over the past decade or so
 the retail side of the food industry has seen a continuing shift of sales to alternate food outlets such as supercenters
 warehouse clubs
 organic and &#8220;natural&#8221; food stores
 dollar stores
 drug stores and e-tailers. Among other things
 this shift has caused consolidation of traditional grocery chains into larger entities
 often spanning the country under varying banner names. Consolidation has increased the importance of having a number one or two brand within a category
 be that position national or regional. At the same time
 this shift has also introduced many alternatives to traditional grocery chains. A broad sales and distribution infrastructure has also become critical for food companies
Sales
We sell
 market and distribute our products through a multiple-channel sales
 marketing and distribution system to all major U.S. food channels
 including sales and shipments to supermarkets
 mass merchants
 warehouse clubs
 wholesalers
 foodservice distributors and direct accounts
 specialty food distributors
 military commissaries and non-food outlets such as drug
 dollar store chains and e-tailers. Certain of our brands
 including 
 
 
 
 seasoning mixes
 
 
 
 
 
 are also distributed to similar food channels in Canada. We sell
 market and distribute our household brand
 
 through the same sales
 marketing and distribution system to many of the same customers who buy our food products as well as to other household product retailers and distributors.
We sell our products primarily through broker sales networks to supermarket chains
 foodservice outlets
 mass merchants
 warehouse clubs
Our sales organization is aligned by distribution channels and consists of regional sales managers
 key account managers and sales persons. Regional sales managers sell our products nationwide through national and regional brokers
 with separate organizations focusing on foodservice
 grocery chain accounts and special markets. Our sales managers coordinate our broker sales efforts
Our sales strategy is centered on individual brands. We allocate promotional spending for each of our brands and our regional sales managers coordinate promotions with customers. Additionally
 our marketing department works in conjunction with the sales department to coordinate special account activities and marketing support
 such as couponing
Our marketing organization is aligned by brand and is responsible for the strategic planning for each of our brands. We focus on deploying promotional dollars where we believe the spending will have the greatest impact on sales. Marketing and trade spending support
 on a national basis
 typically consists of advertising trade promotions
 coupons and cross-promotions with supporting products. Radio
 internet
We distribute our products through a multiple-channel system that covers every class of customer nationwide. Due to the different demands of distribution for frozen and shelf-stable products
Our shelf-stable distribution network consists of five primary locations
 four of which are leased by us and are operated for us by a third party logistics provider
 and one that is located at an owned manufacturing facility and is operated by us. In Canada
Our frozen distribution network consists of seven primary locations
We believe that our distribution systems for shelf-stable and frozen products have sufficient capacity to accommodate incremental product volume. See Item&#160;2
 &#8220;Properties&#8221; for a listing of our owned and leased distribution centers and warehouses. During 2019 and 2018
 we were negatively impacted by industry-wide increases in the cost of distribution
 primarily driven by freight costs. Despite higher rates for freight in 2019
 we were able to offset these increases
 in part as a result of our 2019 pricing strategy that included both list price increases as well as a trade spend optimization program. Separately
We expect freight rates to remain elevated in 2020. To the extent that we are unable to offset present and future cost increases
Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 59.1% of our net sales and approximately 62.3% of our end of the year receivables for fiscal 2019. Other than Walmart
 which accounted for approximately 25.6% of our fiscal 2019 net sales
 no single customer accounted for 10.0% or more of our fiscal 2019 net sales. Other than Walmart
 which accounted for approximately 29.1% of our receivables as of December 28
 2019
 no single customer accounted for more than 10.0% of our receivables as of December 28
 2019. During fiscal 2019
 2018 and 2017
 our net sales to foreign countries represented approximately 7.7%
 7.3% and 6.3%
 respectively
Sales of a number of our products tend to be seasonal and may be influenced by holidays
 changes in seasons/weather or certain other annual events. In general
 our sales are higher in the first and fourth quarters.
We purchase most of the produce used to make our frozen and shelf-stable canned vegetables
 pickles
 relishes
 peppers
 tomatoes and other related specialty items during the months of June through October
 and we generally purchase the majority of our maple syrup requirements during the months of April through August. Consequently
We face competition in each of our product lines. Numerous brands and products compete for shelf space and sales
 with competition based primarily on product quality
 convenience
 price
 trade promotion
 consumer promotion
 brand recognition and loyalty
 customer service
 advertising and other activities and the ability to identify and satisfy emerging consumer preferences. We compete with numerous companies of varying sizes
 including divisions or subsidiaries of larger companies. Many of these competitors have multiple product lines
 substantially greater financial and other resources and may have lower fixed costs and/or be substantially less leveraged than we are. Our ability to grow our business could be impacted by the relative effectiveness of
 and competitive response to
 our product initiatives
 product innovation
 advertising and promotional activities. In addition
 from time to time
Our products compete not only against other brands in their respective product categories
 but also against products in similar or related product categories. For example
 our shelf-stable pickles compete not only with other brands of shelf-stable pickles
 but also with pickle products found in the refrigerated sections of grocery stores
We purchase raw materials
 including agricultural products
 meat
 poultry
 flour
 other raw materials
 ingredients and packaging materials from growers
 commodity processors
 other food companies and packaging suppliers located in U.S. and foreign locations. The principal raw materials for our products include corn
 peas
 broccoli
 beans
 pepper
 garlic and other spices
 maple syrup
 wheat
 corn
 nuts
 cheese
 fruits
 beans
 tomatoes
 peppers
 meat
 sugar
 concentrates
 brand are primarily purchased under dedicated acreage supply contracts from a number of growers prior to each growing season with the remaining demand being sourced directly from third parties. We purchase certain other agricultural raw materials in bulk or pursuant to short-term supply contracts. Most of our agricultural products are purchased between April&#160;1 and October&#160;31. We generally source pepper
 garlic and other spices and herbs from locations other than the United States. We purchase the majority of our maple syrup from Canada. We also use packaging materials
 particularly glass jars
 cans
 cardboard and plastic containers. The profitability of our business relies in substantial part on the prices we and our co-packers pay for these raw materials and packaging materials
 which can fluctuate due to a number of factors
 including changes in crop size
 national
 state and local government sponsored agricultural programs
 export demand
 currency exchange rates
 natural disasters
 weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons
 water supply
 general growing conditions
 the effect of insects
 plant diseases and fungi
 and glass
Fluctuations in commodity prices can lead to retail price volatility and intensive price competition
The cost of labor
 manufacturing
 energy
 fuel
 packaging materials and other costs related to the production and distribution of our food products can from time to time increase significantly and unexpectedly. We attempt to manage these risks by entering into short-term supply contracts and advance commodities purchase agreements
 implementing cost saving measures and raising sales prices. During the past three years
 our cost saving measures and sales price increases have not been sufficient to fully offset increases to our raw material
 ingredient and packaging costs. To the extent we are unable to offset present and future cost increases
We operate eleven manufacturing facilities for our products. See Item&#160;2
 &#8220;Properties&#8221; for a listing of our manufacturing facilities.
In addition to our own manufacturing facilities
 we source a significant portion of our products under &#8220;co-packing&#8221; arrangements
 a common industry practice in which manufacturing is outsourced to other companies. We regularly evaluate our co-packing arrangements to ensure the most cost-effective manufacturing of our products and to utilize company-owned manufacturing facilities most effectively. Third parties located in U.S. and foreign locations produce our 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
products under co-packing agreements or purchase orders. Each of our co-packers produces products for other companies as well. We believe that there are alternative sources of co-packing production readily available for the majority of our products
We consider our trademarks
 in the aggregate
 to be material to our business. We protect our trademarks by registration in the United States
 Canada and in other countries where we sell our products. We also oppose any infringement in key markets. Trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered. Registrations generally are for renewable

As of December 28
 2019
 our workforce consisted of 2
899 employees. Of that total
 2
534 employees were engaged in manufacturing
 133 were engaged in marketing and sales
 139 were engaged in warehouse and distribution and 93 were engaged in administration. Approximately 62.5% of our employees
 located at six facilities in the United States and one facility in Mexico
 are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Agreements covering employees at five of our facilities in the United States
 which vary in term depending on the location
 expire on March 27
 2020 (Terre&#160;Haute

The agreement covering employees at a sixth facility in Brooklyn
 New York expired on December 31
 2019. During January 2020
 we reached an agreement in principle with the United Food and Commercial Workers Union
 Local No.&#160;342
 to extend the collective bargaining agreement for an additional four-year period ending December&#160;21
&#160;2024. The new agreement has been ratified by the union employees at our Brooklyn facility. There are two unions representing employees at our facility in Mexico
 (1) the Industrial Union of Stevedore Workers
 Cargo Transport Operators and Similar from the Mexican Republic and (2) the Union of Agriculture Workers at the Service of the Region. Our collective bargaining agreements with these two unions do not expire; however
As noted above
 three of our collective bargaining agreements
 covering approximately 100 employees at our Terre Haute facility
 approximately 50 employees at our Roseland facility and approximately 275 employees at our Ankeny facility
 expire in the next twelve months. While we believe that our relations with our union employees are in general good
 we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements for our Terre Haute
 Roseland and Ankeny facilities on terms satisfactory to us
 or at all
 and without production interruptions
 including labor stoppages. At this time
 however
 management does not expect that the outcome of these negotiations will have a material adverse impact on our business
As a manufacturer and marketer of food and household products
 our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
 the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
 the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
 the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)
 the United States Department of Labor
 the Environmental Protection Agency and various other federal
 state
 local and foreign authorities (including government authorities in Canada and Mexico) regarding the manufacturing

 labeling
 sale and distribution of our products and the health and safety of our employees. Our manufacturing facilities and products are subject to periodic inspection by federal
 state
 local and foreign authorities. In addition
 our meat processing operation in Portland
We are subject to the Food
 Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Food Safety Modernization Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. This comprehensive regulatory program governs
 among other things
 the manufacturing
 composition and ingredients
 labeling
 packaging and safety of food. We are also subject to the U.S. Bio-Terrorism Act of 2002 which imposes on us import and export regulations. Under the Bio-Terrorism Act we are required
 among other things
 to provide specific information about the food products we ship into the United States and to register our manufacturing
We believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with all material governmental laws and regulations and maintain all material permits and licenses relating to our operations. Nevertheless
 there can be no assurance that we are in full compliance with all such laws and regulations or that we will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations in a cost-effective manner. Failure by us to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil remedies
 including fines
 injunctions
 recalls or seizures
 as well as potential criminal sanctions
 all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business
 consolidated financial condition
As part of our commitment to being a good corporate citizen
 we consider environmental sustainability to be an important strategic focus area. For instance
 our manufacturing operations have a variety of initiatives in place to reduce energy usage
 conserve water
 improve wastewater management
 reduce packaging and where possible use recycled and recyclable packaging. We continue to evaluate and modify our manufacturing and other processes on an ongoing basis to mitigate risk and further reduce our impact on the environment
 conserve water and reduce waste.
We are also subject to environmental laws and regulations in the normal course of business. We have not made any material expenditures during the last three fiscal years in order to comply with environmental laws or regulations. Based on our experience to date
 we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations (and liability for known environmental conditions) will not have a material adverse effect on our business
 consolidated financial condition
 results of operations or liquidity. However
 we cannot predict what environmental laws or regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced
 administered or interpreted

Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business
 consolidated financial condition
 results of operations or liquidity. In that case
The packaged food industry is highly competitive. Numerous brands and products
 including private label products
 compete for shelf space and sales
 with competition based primarily on product quality
 convenience
 price
 trade promotion
 brand recognition and loyalty
 customer service
 effective consumer advertising and promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy emerging consumer preferences. We compete with a significant number of companies of varying sizes
 including divisions or subsidiaries of larger companies. Many of these competitors have multiple product lines
 substantially greater financial and other resources available to them and may have lower fixed costs and/or are substantially less leveraged than our company. If we are unable to continue to compete successfully with these companies or if competitive pressures or other factors cause our products to lose market share or result in significant price erosion
 our business
 consolidated financial condition
 results of operations or liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.
Our largest customer
 Walmart
 accounted for approximately 25.6% of our fiscal 2019 net sales
 and our ten largest customers together accounted for approximately 59.1% of our fiscal 2019 net sales. As the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and our retail customers grow larger and become more sophisticated
 our retail customers may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. Further
 these customers are reducing their inventories and increasing their emphasis on products that hold either the number one or number two market position and private label products. If we fail to use our sales and marketing expertise to maintain our category leadership positions to respond to these trends
 or if we lower our prices or increase promotional support of our products and are unable to increase the volume of our products sold
We are vulnerable to decreases in the supply and increases in the price of raw materials and labor
 manufacturing
 distribution and other costs
We purchase agricultural products
 including vegetables and spices and seasonings
 meat
 poultry
 other raw materials
 ingredients and packaging materials from growers
 commodity processors
 other food companies and packaging manufacturers. Raw materials
 ingredients and packaging materials are subject to increases in price attributable to a number of factors
 including changes in crop size
 federal and state agricultural programs
 export demand
 currency exchange rates
 energy and fuel costs
 water supply
 weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons
 insects
 plant diseases and fungi
 and glass
 metal and plastic prices. Fluctuations in commodity prices can lead to retail price volatility and intensive price competition
 and can influence consumer and trade buying patterns. The cost of labor
 manufacturing
 energy
 fuel
 packaging materials and other costs related to the production and distribution of our products can from time to time increase significantly and unexpectedly. We attempt to manage these risks by entering into short-term supply contracts and advance commodities purchase agreements from time to time
 by implementing cost saving measures and by raising sales prices. During the past three years
 our cost saving measures and sales price increases have not been sufficient to fully offset increases to our raw material
 ingredient
 packaging and distribution costs. To the extent we are unable to offset present and future cost increases
Most of our food product categories are mature and certain categories have experienced declining consumption rates from time to time. If consumption rates and sales in our mature food product categories decline
 our revenue and operating income may be adversely affected
acquisition in May&#160;2019
 acquisition in October 2017 and we expect to pursue additional acquisitions of food product lines and businesses. However
 we may be unable to identify and consummate additional acquisitions or may be unable to successfully integrate and manage the product lines or businesses that we have recently acquired or may acquire in the future. In addition
 we may be unable to achieve a substantial portion of any anticipated cost savings from acquisitions or other anticipated benefits in the timeframe we anticipate
 or at all. Moreover
 any acquired product lines or businesses may require a greater than anticipated amount of trade
 promotional and capital spending. Acquisitions involve numerous risks
 including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations
 technologies
 services and products of the acquired companies
 personnel turnover and the diversion of management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns. Any inability by us to integrate and manage any product lines or businesses that we have recently acquired or may acquire in the future in a timely and efficient manner
 any inability to achieve a substantial portion of any anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the time frame we anticipate or any unanticipated required increases in trade
 promotional or capital spending could adversely affect our business
 consolidated financial condition
 results of operations or liquidity. Moreover
 future acquisitions by us could result in our incurring substantial additional indebtedness
 being exposed to contingent liabilities or incurring the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
 all of which could adversely affect our financial condition
 results of operations and liquidity.
We have substantial indebtedness
At December 28
 2019
 we had total long-term indebtedness of $1
900.0&#160;million (before debt discount)
 including $450.0&#160;million principal amount of senior secured indebtedness and $1
450.0&#160;million principal amount of senior unsecured indebtedness. Our ability to pay dividends is subject to contractual restrictions contained in the instruments governing our indebtedness. Although our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes (which we refer to as the senior notes indentures) contain covenants that restrict our ability to incur debt
 as long as we meet these covenants we will be able to incur additional indebtedness. The degree to which we are leveraged on a consolidated basis could have important consequences to the holders of our securities
our ability in the future to obtain additional financing for working capital
a significant portion of our cash flow is likely to be dedicated to the payment of interest on our indebtedness
 thereby reducing funds available for future operations
 capital expenditures
The agreements governing our indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions prohibit or limit
the payment of dividends on
 and purchase or redemption of
a number of restricted payments
consolidations
Our credit agreement requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests
 including
 without limitation
Our ability to comply with the ratios or tests may be affected by events beyond our control
 including prevailing economic
 financial and industry conditions. A breach of any of these covenants
 or failure to meet or maintain ratios or tests could result in a default under our credit agreement and/or our senior notes indentures. Certain events of default under our credit agreement and our senior notes indentures would prohibit us from paying dividends on our common stock. In addition
 upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit agreement or our senior notes indentures
 the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement and the senior notes
 together with accrued interest
 to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay those amounts
 the credit agreement lenders could proceed against the security granted to them to secure that indebtedness. If the lenders accelerate the payment of the indebtedness
To service our indebtedness
Our ability to make interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness
 and to fund planned capital expenditures and potential acquisitions depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operations in the future. This 
ability
 to a certain extent
 is subject to general economic
 financial
 competitive
 legislative
A significant portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to servicing our debt requirements. In addition
Our ability to continue to expand our business is
 to a certain extent
 dependent upon our ability to borrow funds under our credit agreement and to obtain other third-party financing
Financial market conditions may impede our access to
 or increase the cost of
Any future financial market disruptions or tightening of the credit markets
 may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for acquisitions or increase the cost of obtaining financing. In addition
 our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies that are based
 in significant part
Future disruptions in the credit markets or other factors
Our $700.0&#160;million revolving credit facility matures on November 21
 2022
 our $900.0&#160;million of 5.25% senior notes due 2025 mature on April 1
 2025
 our $450.0 million of tranche B term loans mature on October 10
 2026 and our $550.0 million of 5.25% senior notes due 2027 mature on September 15
 2027. Our ability to raise debt or equity capital in the public or private markets in order to effect a refinancing of our debt at or prior to maturity could be impaired by various factors
 including factors beyond our control. For example
 in recent years U.S. credit markets experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions that caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets
 making financing terms for borrowers less attractive
 and in certain cases resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing. Any future uncertainty in the credit markets could negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms
 or at all. In addition
 any future uncertainty in other financial markets in the U.S. could make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock or other equity securities. Any of these risks could impair our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business or increase our interest expense
If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at or prior to maturity on commercially reasonable terms or at all
 we would be forced to seek other alternatives
If we are forced to pursue any of the above options
We rely on co-packers for a significant portion of our manufacturing needs
We rely upon co-packers for a significant portion of our manufacturing needs. The success of our business depends
 in part
 on maintaining a strong sourcing and manufacturing platform. We believe that there are a limited number of competent
 high-quality co-packers in the industry
 and if we were required to obtain additional or alternative co-packing agreements or arrangements in the future
 we can provide no assurance that we would be able to do so on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner. Our inability to enter into satisfactory co-packing agreements could limit our ability to implement our business plan or meet customer demand.
We rely on the performance of major retailers
 wholesalers
 specialty distributors and mass merchants for the success of our business
 and should they perform poorly or give higher priority to other brands or products
We sell our products principally to retail outlets and wholesale distributors including
 traditional supermarkets
 mass merchants
 warehouse clubs
 wholesalers
 foodservice distributors and direct accounts
 specialty food distributors
 military commissaries and non-food outlets such as drug store chains
 dollar stores and e-tailers. The replacement by or poor performance of our major wholesalers
 retailers or chains or our inability to collect accounts receivable from our customers could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition
 our customers offer branded and private label products that compete directly with our products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases. Accordingly
 there is a risk that our customers may give higher priority to their own products or to the products of our competitors. In the future
We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and consumer demographics
Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing tastes
 dietary habits and product packaging preferences of consumers in the market categories in which we compete. If we are not able to anticipate
 identify or develop and market products that respond to these changes in consumer preferences
 whether resulting from changing consumer demographics or otherwise
 demand for our products may decline and our operating results may be adversely affected. In addition
Severe weather conditions
Severe weather conditions
 natural disasters and other natural events
 such as floods
 droughts
 frosts
 earthquakes
 pestilence or health pandemics
 such as the novel coronavirus that recently originated in China
 may affect the supply of the raw materials that we use for our products. Our maple syrup products
 for instance
 are particularly susceptible to severe freezing conditions in Qu&#233;bec
 frozen vegetable manufacturing facility in Irapuato
 Mexico is located in a region affected by water scarcity and restrictions on usage. We source certain spices and other raw materials from China and if the severity and reach of the coronavirus outbreak increases
 there may be significant disruptions to our supply chain and operations
 and delays in the manufacture and shipment of our products. Competing manufacturers can be affected differently by weather conditions
 natural disasters and other natural events depending on the location of their supplies. If our supplies of raw materials are delayed or reduced
 we may not be able to find supplemental supply sources on favorable terms or at all
Climate change
 water scarcity or legal
 regulatory
 or market measures to address climate change or water scarcity
In the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity
 we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products. We may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change
 which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. For example
 frozen vegetable manufacturing facility in Irapuato
 Mexico is already affected by water scarcity in that region of Mexico. Any further restrictions on
 or loss of
 water rights due to water scarcity
The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional
 federal
 foreign and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. In the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy and resource efficiency
 we may experience significant increases in our manufacturing and distribution costs. In particular
 increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase 
the supply chain and distribution costs associated with our products. As a result
Most of our products are sourced from single manufacturing sites
Our products are manufactured at many different manufacturing facilities
 including our eleven manufacturing facilities and manufacturing facilities operated by our co-packers. However
 in most cases
 individual products are produced only at a single location. If any of these manufacturing locations experiences a disruption for any reason
 including a work stoppage
 power failure
 fire
 or weather related condition or natural disaster
 etc.
 this could result in a significant reduction or elimination of the availability of some of our products. If we were not able to obtain alternate production capability in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms
 this could have a material adverse effect on our business
 consolidated financial condition
Our operations are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations
Our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA
 the USDA
 the FTC
 the SEC
 the CPSC
 the United States Department of Labor
 the Environmental Protection Agency and various other federal
 state
 local and foreign authorities. We are also subject to U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States
 including anti-bribery laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Any changes in these laws and regulations
 or any changes in how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced
 administered or interpreted could increase the cost of developing
 manufacturing and distributing our products or otherwise increase the cost of conducting our business
 or expose us to additional risk of liabilities and claims
 which could have a material adverse effect on our business
 consolidated financial condition
 results of operations or liquidity. In addition
 failure by us to comply with applicable laws and regulations
 including future laws and regulations
 could subject us to civil remedies
 including fines
 injunctions
 recalls or seizures
 as well as potential criminal sanctions
 which could have a material adverse effect on our business
 consolidated financial condition
 results of operations or liquidity. See Item&#160;1
Failure by third-party co-packers or suppliers of raw materials to comply with food safety
We rely on co-packers to produce certain of our products and on other suppliers to supply raw materials. Such co-packers and other suppliers
 whether in the United States or outside the United States
 are subject to a number of regulations
 including food safety and environmental regulations. Failure by any of our co-packers or other suppliers to comply with regulations
 or allegations of compliance failure
 may disrupt their operations. Disruption of the operations of a co-packer or other suppliers could disrupt our supply of product or raw materials
 which could have an adverse effect on our business
 consolidated financial condition
 results of operations or liquidity. Additionally
 actions we may take to mitigate the impact of any such disruption or potential disruption
 including increasing inventory in anticipation of a potential production or supply interruption
 may adversely affect our business
 consolidated financial condition
A recall of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition
 we may be subject to significant liability should the consumption of any of our products cause injury
The sale of food products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers. Such injuries may result from mislabeling
 tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination or spoilage
 including the presence of foreign objects
 undeclared allergens
 substances
 chemicals
 other agents or residues introduced during the growing
 manufacturing
 storage
 handling or transportation phases of production. Under certain circumstances
 we may be required to recall products
 leading to a material adverse effect on our business
 consolidated financial condition
 results of operations or liquidity. Even if a situation does not necessitate a recall
 product liability claims might be asserted against us. We have from time to time been involved in product liability lawsuits
 none of which have been material to our business. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and believe our facilities comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations
 if the consumption of any of our products causes
 or is alleged to have caused
 a health-related illness in the future we may become subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued
 the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused injury
 illness or death could adversely affect our reputation with 
existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image. Moreover
 claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. We maintain product liability insurance and product contamination insurance in amounts we believe to be adequate. However
 we cannot assure you that we will not incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage. A product liability judgment against us or a product recall or the damage to our reputation resulting therefrom could have a material adverse effect on our business
 consolidated financial condition
We are
 or may become
 party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business
 which may include lawsuits or claims relating to contracts
 intellectual property
 product recalls
 product liability
 the marketing and labeling of products
 employment matters
 environmental matters or other aspects of our business. Even when not merited
 the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management&#8217;s attention
 and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition
 we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies
 which could have a material adverse effect on our business
 consolidated financial condition
 results of operations or liquidity. The outcome of litigation is often difficult to predict
 and the outcome of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business
 consolidated financial condition
If consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of our food products even without a product liability claim or a product recall
 our business could be adversely affected. Consumers have been increasingly focused on food safety and health and wellness with respect to the food products they buy. We have been and will continue to be impacted by publicity concerning the health implications of food products generally
We purchase a significant majority of our maple syrup requirements from suppliers in Qu&#233;bec
Our operations in foreign countries are subject to political
Our relationships with foreign suppliers and co-packers as well as our manufacturing location in Irapuato
 Mexico also subject us to the risks of doing business outside the United States. The countries from which we source our raw materials and certain of our finished goods may be subject to political and economic instability
 and may periodically enact new or revise existing laws
 taxes
 duties
 quotas
 tariffs
 currency controls or other restrictions to which we are subject
 including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries or the nationalization of operations. Our products are subject to import duties and other restrictions
 and the U.S. government may periodically impose new or revise existing duties
 quotas
 tariffs or other restrictions to which we are subject
In particular
 our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement
In addition
 changes in respective wage rates among the countries from which we and our competitors source product could substantially impact our competitive position. Changes in exchange rates
 import/export duties or relative international wage rates applicable to us or our competitors could adversely impact our business
 financial condition and results of operations. These changes may impact us in a different manner than our competitors.
Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations. Our principal exposures are to the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso. For example
 our foreign sales are primarily to customers in Canada. Net sales in Canada accounted for approximately 5.7%
 5.7% and 5.5% of our total net sales in fiscal 2019
 2018 and 2017
 respectively. Although our sales for export to other countries are generally denominated in U.S. dollars
 our sales to Canada are generally denominated in Canadian dollars. As a result
 our net sales to Canada are subject to the effect of foreign currency fluctuations
 and these fluctuations could have an adverse impact on operating results. From time to time
 we may enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations
We maintain an extensive trademark portfolio that we consider to be of significant importance to our business. If the actions we take to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as an alleged violation of their trademarks and proprietary rights
 it may be necessary for us to initiate or enter into litigation in the future to enforce our trademark rights or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others. Any legal proceedings could result in an adverse determination that could have a material adverse effect on our business
 consolidated financial condition
We maintain four company-sponsored defined benefit pension plans that cover approximately 39.7% of our employees. A deterioration in the value of plan assets resulting from poor market performance
 a general financial downturn or otherwise could cause an increase in the amount of contributions we are required to make to these plans. For example
 our defined benefit pension plans may from time to time move from an overfunded to underfunded status driven by decreases in plan asset values that may result from changes in long-term interest rates and disruptions in U.S. or global financial markets. Additionally
 historically low interest rates coupled with poor market performance would have the effect of decreasing the funded status of these plans which would result in greater required contributions. For a more detailed description of these plans
 see Part II
 Item&#160;7
&#8221; and Note 12
 &#8220;Pension&#160;Benefits
&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements in Part&#160;II
We also participate in a multi-employer pension plan maintained by the labor union representing certain of our employees at our Portland
 Maine facility. We make periodic contributions to this plan pursuant to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. In the event that we withdraw from participation in this plan or substantially reduce our participation in this plan (such as due to a workforce reduction)
 or if a mass withdrawal were to occur
 applicable law could require us to make withdrawal liability payments to the plan
 and we would have to reflect that liability on our balance sheet. The amount of our withdrawal liability would depend on the extent of this plan&#8217;s funding of vested benefits at the time of our withdrawal. Currently the plan is severely underfunded. Furthermore
For a more detailed description of this multi-employer plan
 which is in critical and declining status
 see Note&#160;12
 &#8220;Pension Benefits
&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements in Part&#160;II
An obligation to make additional
 unanticipated contributions to our defined benefit plans or the multi-employer plan described above could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses
 and may have a material adverse effect on our business
 consolidated financial position
Our financial well-being could be jeopardized by unforeseen changes in our employees&#8217; collective bargaining agreements
As of December 28
 2019
 approximately 62.5% of our 2
899 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. A prolonged work stoppage or strike at any of our facilities with union employees or a significant work disruption from other labor disputes in the food or related industries could have a material adverse effect on our business
 consolidated financial condition
 results of operations or liquidity. Three of our collective bargaining agreements expire in the next twelve months. The collective bargaining agreement covering our Terre Haute facility
 which covers approximately 100 employees
 is scheduled to expire on March 27
 2020; the collective bargaining agreement covering 
our Roseland facility
 which covers approximately 50 employees
 is scheduled to expire on March 31
 2020; and the collective bargaining agreement covering our Ankeny facility
 which covers approximately 275 employees
 is scheduled to expire on April 5
While we believe that our relations with our union employees are in general good
 we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements for our Terre Haute
 Roseland and Ankeny facilities on terms satisfactory to us
 or at all
 and without production interruptions
 including labor stoppages. If
 prior to the expiration of the collective bargaining agreements for the Terre Haute
 Roseland or Ankeny facilities or prior to the expiration of any of our other existing collective bargaining agreements
 we are unable to reach new agreements without union action or any such new agreements are not on terms satisfactory to us

We are increasingly dependent on information technology; Disruptions
Information technology is critically important to our business operations. We rely on information technology networks and systems
 including the Internet
 to process
 transmit and store electronic and financial information
 to manage a variety of business processes and activities
 including manufacturing
 financial
 logistics
 sales
We depend on our information technology infrastructure to communicate internally and externally with employees
 customers
 suppliers and others. We also use information technology networks and systems to comply with regulatory
 legal and tax requirements. These information technology systems
 many of which are managed by third parties or used in connection with shared service centers
 may be susceptible to damage
 disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software
 databases or components thereof
 issues with or errors in systems&#8217; maintenance or security
 migration of applications to the cloud
 power outages
 hardware or software failures
 computer viruses
 malware
 attacks by computer hackers or other cybersecurity risks
 telecommunication failures
 denial of service
 user errors
 natural disasters
Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently in the United States
 are constantly evolving in nature
 are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals (including criminal hackers
 hacktivists
 state-sponsored institutions
 terrorist organizations and individuals or groups participating in organized crime) with a wide range of expertise and motives (including monetization of corporate
 payment or other internal or personal data
 theft of trade secrets and intellectual property for competitive advantage and leverage for political
 social
 economic and environmental reasons). Such cyberattacks and cyber incidents can take many forms including cyber extortion
 denial of service
 social engineering
 such as impersonation attempts to fraudulently induce employees or others to disclose information or unwittingly provide access to systems or data
 introduction of viruses or malware
 such as ransomware through phishing emails
If any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage
 disruption or shutdown
 whether due to natural disaster
 cyberattacks or otherwise
 and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans
 or those of our third party providers
 do not effectively respond to or resolve the issues in a timely manner
 our product sales
 financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected
 and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results
In addition
 if we are unable to prevent physical and electronic break&#8209;ins
 cyberattacks and other information security breaches
 we may suffer financial and reputational damage
 be subject to litigation or incur remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners
 customers
 suppliers or employees. The mishandling or inappropriate disclosure of non&#8209;public sensitive or protected information could lead to the loss of intellectual property
 negatively impact planned corporate transactions or damage our reputation and brand image. Misuse
 leakage or falsification of legally protected information could also result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations and have a negative impact on our reputation
 business
We are implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system
 including additional modules in 2020. We also plan to transition our Mexican operations to the new ERP system by the end of 2021. The implementation of the 
new ERP system has required
 and will continue to require
 the investment of significant financial and human resources. We may not be able to complete successfully the full implementation and integration of the ERP system without experiencing difficulties. Any disruptions
 delays or deficiencies in the design
 implementation and integration of the new ERP system could adversely affect our ability to produce products
 process orders
 ship products
 provide services and customer support
 send invoices and track payments
 fulfill contractual obligations
&#160;integrate acquisitions
If we are unable to retain our key management personnel
Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of senior management
 certain of whom would be difficult to replace. As a result
 departure by members of our senior management could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition
We are a holding company and we rely on dividends
 interest and other payments
We are a holding company
 with all of our assets held by our direct and indirect subsidiaries
 and we rely on dividends and other payments or distributions from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations and to enable us to pay dividends. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or distributions to us depends on their respective operating results and may be restricted by
 among other things
 the laws of their jurisdiction of organization (which may limit the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends)
 agreements of those subsidiaries
 our credit agreement
Future changes that increase cash taxes payable by us could significantly decrease our future cash flow available to make interest and dividend payments with respect to our securities and have a material adverse effect on our business
 consolidated financial condition
We are able to amortize goodwill and certain intangible assets in accordance with Section&#160;197 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. We expect to be able to amortize for tax purposes approximately $988.5 million between 2020 and 2034. The expected annual deductions are approximately $109.9 million for fiscal 2020
 approximately $107.1&#160;million for fiscal 2021
 approximately $95.5 million for fiscal 2022
 approximately $93.6 million per year for fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2024
 approximately $93.4 million for fiscal 2025
 approximately $89.4&#160;million for fiscal&#160;2026
 approximately $69.5&#160;million for fiscal 2027
 approximately $67.0&#160;million for fiscal 2028
 approximately $66.4&#160;million for fiscal 2029
 approximately $60.3&#160;million for fiscal 2030
 approximately $27.6&#160;million for fiscal 2031
 approximately $9.5&#160;million for fiscal 2032
We also take material annual deductions for net interest expense due to our substantial indebtedness. However
 the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
 signed into law on December 22
 2017
 limits the deduction for net interest expense (including the treatment of depreciation and other deductions in arriving at adjusted taxable income) incurred by a corporate taxpayer to 30% of the taxpayer&#8217;s adjusted taxable income. We were not impacted by this limitation in fiscal 2018 due to the gain on sale from the Pirate Brands divestiture
 which increased our adjusted taxable income. However
 in fiscal 2019 our interest expense exceeded 30% of our adjusted taxable income and this limitation resulted in an increase to our taxable income of $30.2 million
 and we accordingly established a deferred tax asset of $7.4&#160;million without a valuation allowance. Any interest that is non-deductible may be carried forward indefinitely and we believe we have sufficient deferred tax liabilities to offset any deferred tax assets resulting from currently non-deductible interest expense. However
 if our interest expense deduction continues to be limited or if we are unable to fully utilize our interest expense deductions in future periods
If there is a change in U.S. federal tax law or
 in the case of the interest deduction
 a change in our net interest expense relative to our adjusted taxable income that eliminates
 limits or reduces our ability to amortize and deduct goodwill and certain intangible assets or the interest deduction we receive on our substantial indebtedness
 or otherwise results in an increase in our corporate tax rate
 our cash taxes payable would increase
 which could significantly reduce 
our future cash and impact our ability to make interest and dividend payments and have a material adverse effect on our business
 consolidated financial condition
Likewise
 the ultimate impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on our reported results in fiscal 2020 and beyond may differ from the estimates provided in this report
 possibly materially
 due to guidance that may be issued and other actions we may take as a result of the new tax law different from that currently contemplated. See Note 10
 &#8220;Income Taxes
&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements in Part II
Our total assets include substantial goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (trademarks). These assets are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. The annual goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing our company&#8217;s market capitalization with our company&#8217;s carrying value
 including goodwill. If the carrying value of our company exceeds our market capitalization
 we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the amount of the impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying value and recognizing a loss for the difference. We test our indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value with the carrying value and recognize a loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets based on discounted cash flows that reflect certain third party market value indicators. Estimating our fair value for these purposes requires significant estimates and assumptions by management. We completed our annual impairment tests for fiscal 2019
 2018 and 2017 with no adjustments to the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. However
 an interim impairment analysis relating to one of our brands performed during fiscal 2014 resulted in our company recording non-cash impairment charges to finite-lived trademarks and customer relationships for the brand of $26.9&#160;million and $7.3&#160;million
 respectively
 during fiscal 2014. During the second quarter of 2016
 we discontinued that brand because there was not sufficient demand to warrant continued production. Accordingly
 we wrote off the related intangible assets and recorded non-cash impairment charges to finite-lived trademarks and customer relationships of $4.5 million and $0.9 million
 respectively
 which are recorded in &#8220;Impairment of intangible assets&#8221; on the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2016. If operating results for any of our other brands
 including newly acquired brands
 deteriorate
 at rates in excess of our current projections
 we may be required to record additional non-cash impairment charges to certain intangible assets. In addition
 any significant decline in our market capitalization
 even if due to macroeconomic factors
 could put pressure on the carrying value of our goodwill. A determination that all or a portion of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired
 although a non-cash charge to operations
 could have a material adverse effect on our business
Any future financial market disruptions or tightening of the credit markets could result in some of our customers experiencing a significant decline in profits and/or reduced liquidity. A significant adverse change in the financial and/or credit position of a customer could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer and could limit our ability to collect receivables. A significant adverse change in the financial and/or credit position of a supplier or co-packer could result in an interruption of supply. This could have a material adverse effect on our business
 consolidated financial condition
Dividend payments are not mandatory or guaranteed and holders of our common stock do not have any legal right to receive
 or require us to pay
 dividends. Our board of directors may
 in its sole discretion
 decrease the level of dividends provided for in our dividend policy or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends. Future dividends with respect to shares of our capital stock
 if any
 depend on
 among other things
 our results of operations
 cash requirements
 financial condition
 contractual restrictions (including restrictions in our credit agreement and senior notes indentures)
 
business opportunities
If our cash flows from operating activities were to fall below our minimum expectations (or if our assumptions as to capital expenditures or interest expense were too low or our assumptions as to the sufficiency of our revolving credit facility to finance our working capital needs were to prove incorrect)
 we may need either to reduce or eliminate dividends or
 to the extent permitted under our credit agreement and senior notes indentures
 fund a portion of our dividends with borrowings or from other sources. If we were to use working capital or permanent borrowings to fund dividends
 we would have less cash and/or borrowing capacity available for future dividends and other purposes
 which could negatively impact our financial condition
 results of operations
Our dividend policy may negatively impact our ability to finance capital expenditures
Under our dividend policy
 a substantial portion of our cash generated by our business in excess of operating needs
 interest and principal payments on indebtedness
 and capital expenditures sufficient to maintain our properties and assets is in general distributed as regular quarterly cash dividends to the holders of our common stock. As a result
 we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to finance growth opportunities or unanticipated capital expenditure needs or to fund our operations in the event of a significant business downturn. We may have to forego growth opportunities or capital expenditures that would otherwise be necessary or desirable if we do not find alternative sources of financing. If we do not have sufficient cash for these purposes
Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of preferred stock without stockholder approval and
 in the case of preferred stock
 upon such terms as the board of directors may determine. The rights of the holders of shares of our common stock will be subject to
 and may be adversely affected by
 the rights of holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future
 including any preferential rights that we may grant to the holders of preferred stock. The terms of any preferred stock we issue may place restrictions on the payment of dividends to the holders of our common stock. If we issue preferred stock that is senior to our common stock in right of dividend payment
 and our cash flows from operating activities or surplus are insufficient to support dividend payments to the holders of preferred stock
 on the one hand
 and to the holders of common stock
 on the other hand
We may issue shares of our common stock or other securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock from time to time in future financings or as consideration for future acquisitions and investments. In the event any such future financing
 acquisition or investment is significant
 the number of shares of our common stock or other securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock that we may issue may in turn be significant. In addition
 we may grant registration rights covering shares of our common stock or other securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock
 as applicable
 issued in connection with any such future financing
Future sales or the availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock
 whether issued and sold pursuant to our currently effective shelf registration statement or otherwise
 would dilute our earnings per share and the voting power of each share of common stock outstanding prior to such sale or distribution
Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions that may make it difficult for another company to acquire us and for holders of our securities to receive any related takeover premium for their securities. For example
 our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of preferred stock without stockholder approval and upon such terms as the board of directors may determine. The rights of the holders of shares of our common stock will 
be subject to
 and may be adversely affected by

 Item&#160;8 of this Annual Report on Form&#160;10-K is incorporated herein by reference.
Item&#160;5. Market for Registrant&#8217;s Common Equity
Shares of our common stock are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &#8220;BGS&#8221; and have been so traded since May&#160;23
 2007. According to the records of our transfer agent
 we had 181 holders of record of our common stock as of February 21
 2020
 including Cede&#160;&amp;&#160;Co. as nominee for The Depository Trust Company (DTC). Cede&#160;&amp;&#160;Co. as nominee for DTC holds shares of our common stock on behalf of participants in the DTC system
Set forth below is a line graph comparing the change in the cumulative total shareholder return on our company&#8217;s common stock with the cumulative total return of the Russell 2000 Index and the S&amp;P Packaged Foods&#160;&amp; Meats Index for the period from January 3
 2015 to December 28

 assuming the investment of $100 on January 3

&#160;Inc. Common Stock
B&amp;G&#160;Foods
$100 invested on January 3
 2015 in B&amp;G Foods&#8217; common stock or index
 including reinvestment of dividends. Indexes calculated on month-end basis.
Our dividend policy reflects a basic judgment that our stockholders are better served when we distribute a substantial portion of our cash available to pay dividends to them instead of retaining it in our business. Under this policy
 a substantial portion of the cash generated by our company in excess of operating needs
 interest and principal payments on indebtedness
For fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018
 we had cash flows from operating activities of $46.5 million and $209.5&#160;million
 respectively
 and distributed $123.7&#160;million and $124.5 million as dividends
 respectively. At our current dividend rate of $1.90 per share per annum
Under U.S. federal income tax law
 distributions to holders of our common stock are taxable to the extent they are paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits. Generally
 the portion of the distribution treated as a return of capital should reduce the tax basis in the shares of common stock up to a holder&#8217;s adjusted basis in the common stock
 with any excess treated as capital gains. Qualifying dividend income and the return of capital
 if any
 will be allocated on a pro-forma basis to all distributions for each fiscal year. Based on U.S. federal income tax laws
 B&amp;G Foods has determined that for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018
 approximately 92.5% and 0.0%
 respectively
 of distributions paid on common stock were treated as a return of capital and approximately 7.5% and 100.0%
 respectively
Our dividend policy is based upon our current assessment of our business and the environment in which we operate
 and that assessment could change based on competitive or other developments (which could
 for example
 increase our need for capital expenditures or working capital)
 new acquisition opportunities or other factors. Our board of directors is free to depart from or change our dividend policy at any time and could do so
 for example
Our ability to pay future dividends
 if any
 with respect to shares of our capital stock will depend on
 among other things
 our results of operations
 cash requirements
 financial condition
 contractual restrictions
 provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Under Delaware law
 our board of directors may declare dividends only to the extent of our &#8220;surplus&#8221; (which is defined as total assets at fair market value minus total liabilities
 minus statutory capital)
 or if there is no surplus
In general
we may use up to 100% of our excess cash (as defined below) for the period (taken as one accounting period) from and including March&#160;31
 2013 to the end of our most recent fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such payments
 plus certain incremental funds described in the indentures for the payment of dividends so long as the fixed charge coverage ratio for the four most recent fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available is not less than 1.6 to 1.0; and
Excess cash is defined in our senior notes indentures and under the terms of our credit agreement. Excess cash is calculated as &#8220;consolidated cash flow
&#8221; as defined in the indentures and under the terms of our credit agreement (which
 in each case
 allows for certain adjustments and which is equivalent to the term adjusted EBITDA)
 minus the sum of cash tax expense
 cash interest expense
 certain capital expenditures
 excess tax benefit from issuance of performance share long-term incentive award (LTIA) shares
In addition
 the terms of our credit agreement also restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends on our common stock. In accordance with the terms of our credit agreement
 we are not permitted to declare or pay dividends unless we are permitted to do so under our senior notes indentures. In addition
a &#8220;consolidated leverage ratio&#8221; (defined as the ratio on a pro forma basis of our consolidated net debt
 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to our adjusted EBITDA for such period) of not more than 7.00 to 1.00.
The following selected historical consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with Part II
 Item&#160;7
 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes to those statements included in this report.

During fiscal 2018
 our divestiture of Pirate Brands resulted in a gain on sale of approximately $176.4&#160;million. The gain on sale negatively impacted our income taxes for fiscal 2019 by approximately $73.9 million
 which includes cash tax payments we made during fiscal 2019 of $44.7 million and a cash tax benefit we otherwise would have expected to receive of approximately $29.2 million. Excluding the negative tax impact of the gain on sale
 our net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 would have been approximately $120.4 million. See Note 3
 &#8220;Acquisitions and Divestitures&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements in Part&#160;II
 Item&#160;8 of this report
 for detailed information. During fiscal&#160;2017

 respectively
EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures used by management to measure operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of our financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated statements of operations
 comprehensive income
 changes in stockholders&#8217; equity and cash flows. We define EBITDA as net income before net interest expense
 income taxes
 depreciation and amortization and loss on extinguishment of debt (see footnote (9) above). We define adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for cash and non-cash acquisition/divestiture-related expenses
 gains and losses (which may include third party fees and expenses
 integration
 restructuring and consolidation expenses
 amortization of acquired inventory fair value step-up and gains and losses on the sale of assets); non-recurring expenses
 gains and losses
 including severance and other expenses relating to a workforce reduction; gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of contingent liabilities from earn-outs; the non-cash accounting impact of our inventory reduction plan; intangible asset impairment charges and related asset write-offs; loss on product recalls
 including customer refunds
 selling
 general and administrative expenses and the impact on cost of sales; and distribution restructuring expenses. Management believes that it is useful to eliminate these items because it allows management to focus on what it deems to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow from operations. We use EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA in our business operations to
 among other things
 evaluate our operating performance
 develop budgets and measure our performance against those budgets
 determine employee bonuses and evaluate our cash flows in terms of cash needs. We also present EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because we believe they are useful indicators of our historical debt capacity and ability to service debt and because covenants in our credit agreement and our senior notes indentures contain ratios based on these measures. As a result
 reports used by internal management during monthly operating reviews feature the EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA metrics. However
 management uses these metrics in conjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance and liquidity measures as part of its overall assessment of company performance and liquidity
EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income
 net income or any other GAAP measure as an indicator of operating performance. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not complete net cash flow measures because EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are measures of liquidity that do not include reductions for cash payments for an entity&#8217;s obligation to service its debt
 fund its working capital
 capital expenditures and acquisitions and pay its income taxes and dividends. Rather
 EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are two potential indicators of an entity&#8217;s ability to fund these cash requirements. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not complete measures of an entity&#8217;s profitability because they do not include certain costs and expenses and gains and losses described above. Because not all companies use identical calculations
 this presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. However
 EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA can still be useful in evaluating our performance against our peer companies because management believes these measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of GAAP amounts.

 allergens that are not declared on the products&#8217; ingredient statements. The cost impact of this recall during fiscal 2015 was $1.9 million
 of which $1.2 million was recorded as a decrease in net sales related to customer refunds; $0.5 million was recorded as an increase in cost of goods sold primarily related to costs associated with product retrieval
 destruction charges and customer fees; and $0.2 million was recorded as an increase in selling

The following Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors
 including those set forth under Part I
 Item&#160;1A
 &#8220;Risk Factors
We manufacture
 sell and distribute a diverse portfolio of branded
 high quality
 shelf-stable and frozen foods and household products
 many of which have leading regional or national market shares. In general
Our company has been built upon a successful track record of acquisition-driven growth. Our goal is to continue to increase sales
 profitability and cash flows through strategic acquisitions
 new product development and organic growth. We intend to implement our growth strategy through the following initiatives: expanding our brand portfolio with disciplined acquisitions of complementary branded businesses
 continuing to develop new products and delivering them to market quickly
Since 1996
 we have successfully acquired and integrated more than 50 brands into our company. Most recently
 on May 15
 2019
 we acquired the Clabber Girl Corporation
 including the 
 
 
 brands of retail baking powder
 baking soda and corn starch
 brand of foodservice dessert mixes
 from Hulman &amp; Company. On July 16
 2018
 brand of premium Irish oatmeal from TreeHouse Foods

 Item 1A
We purchase raw materials
 including agricultural products
 meat
 poultry
 ingredients and packaging materials from growers
 commodity processors
 other food companies and packaging suppliers located in U.S. and foreign locations. Raw materials and other input costs
 such as fuel and transportation
 are subject to fluctuations in price attributable to a number of factors. Fluctuations in commodity prices can lead to retail price volatility and intensive price competition
 and can influence consumer and trade buying patterns. The cost of raw materials
 fuel
 labor
 distribution and other costs related to our operations can increase from time to time significantly and unexpectedly. For example
We attempt to manage cost inflation risks by locking in prices through short-term supply contracts and advance commodities purchase agreements and by implementing cost saving measures. We also attempt to offset rising input costs by raising sales prices to our customers. However
 increases in the prices we charge our customers may lag behind rising input costs. Competitive pressures also may limit our ability to quickly raise prices in response to rising costs.
We experienced moderate net cost increases for raw materials during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 and anticipate higher raw materials cost increases for fiscal 2020. We are currently locked into our supply and prices for a majority of our most significant commodities (excluding
 among others
During 2019 and 2018
 we were negatively impacted by industry-wide increases in the cost of distribution
 primarily driven by freight costs. Despite higher rates for freight in 2019
 we were able to offset these increases
 in part as a result of our 2019 pricing strategy that included both list price increases as well as a trade spend optimization program. Separately
To the extent we are unable to avoid or offset any present or future cost increases by locking in our costs
 implementing cost saving measures or increasing prices to our customers
 our operating results could be materially adversely affected. In addition
 if input costs begin to decline

 even as a result of a product liability claim or a product recall by a food industry competitor
Our foreign sales are primarily to customers in Canada. Our sales to Canada are generally denominated in Canadian dollars and our sales for export to other countries are generally denominated in U.S. dollars. During fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018
 our net sales to customers in foreign countries represented approximately 7.7% and 7.3%
 respectively
 of our total net sales. We also purchase a significant majority of our maple syrup requirements from suppliers located in Qu&#233;bec
 Canada. Any weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar could significantly increase our costs relating to the production of our maple syrup products to the extent we have not purchased Canadian dollars in advance of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar or otherwise entered into a currency hedging arrangement in advance of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar. These increased costs would not be fully offset by the positive impact the change in the relative strength of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar would have on our net sales in Canada. Our purchases of raw materials from other foreign suppliers are generally denominated in U.S. dollars. We also operate a manufacturing facility in Irapuato
 frozen products and are as a result exposed to fluctuations in the Mexican peso. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Costs and expenses in Mexico are recognized in local foreign currency
To confront these challenges
 we continue to take steps to build the value of our brands
 to improve our existing portfolio of products with new product and marketing initiatives
 to reduce costs through improved productivity
 to address consumer concerns about food safety
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions made by management involve revenue recognition as it relates to trade and consumer promotion expenses; pension benefits; acquisition accounting fair value allocations; the recoverability of goodwill
 other intangible assets
 property
 plant and equipment
 and deferred tax assets; and the determination of the useful life of customer relationship and finite-lived trademark intangible assets. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions.
We offer various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers
 such as price discounts
 in-store display incentives
In May 2014
We adopted this guidance and related amendments as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 applying the full retrospective transition approach to all contracts. Based on our comprehensive assessment of the new guidance
 including our evaluation of the five-step approach outlined within the guidance
 we concluded that the adoption would not have a significant impact to our core revenue generating activities. However
 the adoption did result in a change in presentation of certain trade and consumer promotion expenses
 specifically in-store display incentives
We previously recorded in-store display incentives
 or marketing development funds
 within selling
 general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. Upon the adoption of the new guidance
 many of these cash payments did not meet the specific criteria within the new guidance of providing a &#8220;distinct&#8221; good or service
 and therefore
 are required to be presented as a reduction of net sales. The impact of this change resulted in a reduction of net sales

 &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; 
&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements in Part II
Long-lived assets
 such as property
 plant and equipment
 and intangible assets with estimated useful lives are depreciated or amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values
 and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted net future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted net future cash flows
Our total assets include substantial goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (trademarks). These assets are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. We perform the annual impairment tests as of the last day of each fiscal year. The annual goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing our company&#8217;s market capitalization with our company&#8217;s carrying value
 including goodwill. If the carrying value of our company exceeds our market capitalization
 we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the amount of the impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying value and recognizing a loss for the difference. As of December 28
 2019
 we had $596.4 million of goodwill recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. Our testing indicates that the implied fair value of goodwill is significantly in excess of the carrying value. Therefore
 we believe that only significant changes in the cash flow assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill.
We test our indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value with the carrying value and recognize a loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets based on discounted cash flows that reflect certain third party market value indicators. Calculating our fair value for these purposes requires significant estimates and assumptions by management
 including future cash flows consistent with management&#8217;s expectations
 annual sales growth rates
 and certain assumptions underlying a discount rate based on available market data. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating
We completed our annual impairment tests for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 with no adjustments to the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. As of December 28
 2019
 we had $1
375.3 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. None of our indefinite-lived intangible assets had a book value in excess of their calculated fair values and the percentage excess of the aggregate calculated fair value over the aggregate book value was approximately 154.4%. However
 materially different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses. For example
 if future revenues and contributions to our operating results for certain of our brands continue to decline and do not achieve our expected future cash flows
 this could result in impairment losses for those brands. In addition
 any significant decline in our market capitalization
 even if due to macroeconomic factors
 could put pressure on the carrying value of our goodwill. A determination that all or a portion of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired
 although a non-cash charge to operations
 could have a material adverse effect on our business

All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
 such as forecasted growth rates and discount rate
 are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. We believe these assumptions to be reasonable
 but they are inherently uncertain. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in Part I
 Item 1A
 &#8220;Risk Factors
As part of the income tax provision process of preparing our consolidated financial statements
 we are required to estimate our income taxes. This process involves estimating our current tax expenses together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe the recovery is not likely
 we establish a valuation allowance. Further
 to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a financial accounting period
 
we include such charge in our tax provision
 or reduce our tax benefits in our consolidated statements of operations. We use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes
There are various factors that may cause these tax assumptions to change in the near term
 and we may have to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. We cannot predict whether future U.S. federal
 state and international income tax laws and regulations might be passed that could have a material effect on our results of operations. We assess the impact of significant changes to the U.S. federal
See &#8220;U.S. Tax Act&#8221; below for a discussion of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22
 2017
We have defined benefit pension plans covering approximately 39.7% of our employees. Our funding policy is to contribute annually not less than the amount recommended by our actuaries. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors
 including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates
 employee-related demographic factors
 such as turnover
 retirement age and mortality
 and the rate of salary increases. Certain assumptions reflect our historical experience and management&#8217;s best judgment regarding future expectations. Due to the significant management judgment involved
 our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension expenses and obligations. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans
 which exceed the amounts required by statute. We made total contributions to our pension plans of $5.0&#160;million and $5.6&#160;million during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018
 respectively. Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change
 positively or negatively
Our discount rate assumption for our four defined benefit plans changed from 4.08% - 4.18% at December&#160;29
&#160;2018 to 3.03% - 3.18% at December 28
 2019. While we do not currently anticipate a change in our fiscal 2020 assumptions
 as a sensitivity measure
 a 0.25% decrease or increase in our discount rate would increase or decrease our pension expense by approximately $0.9 million to $1.0 million. Similarly
 a 0.25% decrease or increase in the expected return on pension plan assets would increase or decrease our pension expense by approximately $0.3&#160;million. During fiscal 2020 we expect to make total defined benefit pension plan contributions of approximately $4.9 million
 including approximately $4.0 million for our four company- sponsored defined benefit pension plans and approximately $0.9 million for the multi-employer defined benefit pension plan to which we contribute. See Note 12
 &#8220;Pension Benefits
&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements in Part II
Our consolidated financial statements and results of operations include an acquired business&#8217;s operations after the completion of the acquisition. We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting
The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
 as well as asset lives
 can materially impact our results of operations. Accordingly
 for significant items
 we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. All of these judgments and estimates can materially impact our results of operations.
On December 22
 2017
 President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
 which we refer to as the &#8220;U.S. Tax Act.&#8221; The U.S. Tax Act provides for significant changes in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended. The changes in the U.S. Tax Act are broad and complex and we continue to examine the impact the U.S. Tax Act may have on our business and financial results. The U.S. Tax Act contains provisions with separate effective dates but is generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31
Under FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740
 Income Taxes
 we are required to revalue any deferred tax assets or liabilities in the period of enactment of change in tax rates. Beginning on January 1
 2018
 the U.S. Tax Act lowered the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% on our U.S. earnings from that date and beyond. The reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% was effective for our fiscal 2018 and subsequent years. Our consolidated effective tax rate was approximately 27.7% and 22.4% for fiscal 2019 and fiscal&#160;2018
We also expect to realize a cash tax benefit for future bonus depreciation on certain business additions
 which
 together with the reduced income tax rate
The U.S. Tax Act also limits the deduction for net interest expense (including the treatment of depreciation and other deductions in arriving at adjusted taxable income) incurred by a corporate taxpayer to 30% of the taxpayer&#8217;s adjusted taxable income. We were not impacted by this limitation in fiscal 2018 due to the gain on the Pirate Brands sale which increased our adjusted taxable income. However
 in fiscal 2019 this limitation resulted in an increase to our taxable income of $30.2 million
 and we accordingly established a deferred tax asset of $7.4 million without a valuation allowance. Although our interest expense exceeded 30% of our adjusted taxable income in fiscal&#160;2019
 at this time we do not believe this limitation has had
 or will have
The U.S. Treasury issued several regulations supplementing the U.S. Tax Act in 2018
 including detailed guidance clarifying the calculation of the mandatory tax on previously unrepatriated earnings
The ultimate impact of the U.S. Tax Act on our reported results in fiscal 2020 and beyond may differ from the estimates provided in this report
 possibly materially
 due to guidance that may be issued and other actions we may take as a result of the U.S. Tax Act different from that currently contemplated.

EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures used by management to measure operating performance. We define EBITDA as net income before net interest expense
 income taxes
 depreciation and amortization and loss on extinguishment of debt. We define adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for cash and non-cash acquisition/divestiture-related expenses
 gains and losses (which may include third party fees and expenses
 integration
 restructuring and consolidation expenses
 amortization of acquired inventory fair value step-up and gains and losses on the sale of assets); non-recurring expenses
 gains and losses
 including severance and other expenses relating to a workforce reduction; gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of contingent liabilities from earn-outs; the non-cash accounting impact of our inventory reduction plan; intangible asset impairment charges and related asset write-offs; loss on product recalls
 including customer refunds

 general and 
administrative expenses and the impact on cost of sales; and distribution restructuring expenses. Management believes that it is useful to eliminate these items because it allows management to focus on what it deems to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow from operations. We use EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA in our business operations to
 among other things
 evaluate our operating performance
 develop budgets and measure our performance against those budgets
 determine employee bonuses and evaluate our cash flows in terms of cash needs. We also present EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because we believe they are useful indicators of our historical debt capacity and ability to service debt and because covenants in our credit agreement and our senior notes indentures contain ratios based on these measures. As a result
 reports used by internal management during monthly operating reviews feature the EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA metrics. However
 management uses these metrics in conjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance and liquidity measures as part of its overall assessment of company performance and liquidity
EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income
 net income or any other GAAP measure as an indicator of operating performance. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not complete net cash flow measures because EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are measures of liquidity that do not include reductions for cash payments for an entity&#8217;s obligation to service its debt
 fund its working capital
 capital expenditures and acquisitions and pay its income taxes and dividends. Rather
 EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are two potential indicators of an entity&#8217;s ability to fund these cash requirements. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not complete measures of an entity&#8217;s profitability because they do not include certain costs and expenses and gains and losses described above. Because not all companies use identical calculations
 this presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. However

 Net interest expense decreased $10.2 million
 or 9.4%
 to $98.1 million for fiscal 2019 from $108.3 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in average long-term debt outstanding during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018

 and earlier prepayments of long-term debt made during the first and second quarters of 2018

 which includes a cash tax payment of $44.7 million made during fiscal 2019 and a cash tax benefit we otherwise would have expected to receive of approximately $29.2 million. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was also due to unfavorable working capital comparisons to fiscal 2018 (primarily comprised of inventories and trade accounts payable
. Net cash provided by investing activities of $347.6&#160;million for fiscal 2018 decreased $472.3 million to cash used in investing activities of $124.7 million for fiscal 2019. Net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2018 includes the $420.0 million of pre-tax gross proceeds received from the Pirate Brands sale

 acquisition
 pay income taxes due on the 2018 gain on sale of Pirate Brands and fund share repurchases and working capital needs
 partially offset by $123.7 million of dividend payments
During fiscal 2018
 net cash used in financing activities was $753.3 million
 primarily reflecting the prepayment of $650.1 million of tranche B term loans
 $124.5 million of dividend payments and $26.9 million of share repurchases
We made cash tax payments of approximately $47.5 million and $4.7 million during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018
 respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to $44.7 million of cash tax payments made in fiscal 2019 relating to the fiscal 2018 gain on sale of Pirate Brands. We believe that we will realize a benefit to our cash taxes payable from amortization of our trademarks
 goodwill and other intangible assets for the taxable years 2020 through 2034. In fiscal 2019
 however
 our cash taxes were negatively impacted by the U.S. Tax Act&#8217;s limitations on the deductibility of interest expense. See &#8220;U.S. Tax Act&#8221; above for a discussion of the impact and expected impact of the U.S. Tax Act on our cash income tax payments
 including the impact the U.S. Tax Act had in fiscal 2019 and is expected to have in fiscal 2020 and beyond on our interest expense deductions. If there is a change in U.S. federal tax policy or
 in the case of the interest deduction
 a change in our net interest expense relative to our adjusted taxable income that eliminates
 limits or reduces our ability to amortize and deduct goodwill and certain intangible assets or the interest deduction we receive on our substantial indebtedness
 or otherwise that reduces any of these available deductions or results in an increase in our corporate tax rate
 our cash taxes payable may increase further
 which could significantly reduce our future liquidity and impact our ability to make interest and dividend payments and have a material adverse effect on our business

For a discussion of our dividend policy
 see the information set forth under the heading &#8220;Dividend Policy&#8221; in Part&#160;II
Our liquidity and capital resources have been significantly impacted by acquisitions and may be impacted in the foreseeable future by additional acquisitions. As discussed elsewhere in this report
 as part of our growth strategy we plan to expand our brand portfolio with disciplined acquisitions of complementary brands. We have historically financed acquisitions by incurring additional indebtedness
 issuing equity and/or using cash flows from operating activities. Our interest expense has over time increased as a result of additional indebtedness we have incurred in connection with acquisitions and will increase with any additional indebtedness we may incur to finance future acquisitions. Although we may subsequently issue equity and use the proceeds to repay all or a portion of the additional indebtedness incurred to finance an acquisition and reduce our interest expense

 the revolving credit facility under our credit agreement was undrawn and the available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility
 net of outstanding letters of credit of $1.6&#160;million
 was $698.4&#160;million. Proceeds of the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes
 including acquisitions of targets in the same or a similar line of business as our company

On December 28
 2019
 our total long-term debt of $1
874.2 million
 net of our cash and cash equivalents of $11.3 million
 was $1
Our ability to generate sufficient cash to fund our operations depends generally on our results of operations and the availability of financing. Our management believes that our cash and cash equivalents on hand
 cash flow from operating activities and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund operations
 meet debt service requirements
 fund capital expenditures
 make future acquisitions
 if any
We expect to make capital expenditures of approximately $40.0 million to $45.0 million in the aggregate during fiscal 2020. Our projected capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 include
 among other things
 approximately $22.1&#160;million for profit enhancing and asset sustainability projects
Sales of a number of our products tend to be seasonal and may be influenced by holidays
We purchase most of the produce used to make our frozen and shelf-stable vegetables
 shelf-stable pickles
 relishes
 peppers
 tomatoes and other related specialty items during the months of June through October
 and we generally purchase the majority of our maple syrup requirements during the months of April through August. Consequently
We experienced moderate net cost increases for raw materials during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 and anticipate higher raw materials cost increases for fiscal 2020. We are currently locked into our supply and prices for a majority of our most significant commodities (excluding
 among others
In addition
 during 2019 and 2018
 we were negatively impacted by industry-wide increases in the cost of distribution
 primarily driven by freight costs. Despite higher rates for freight in 2019
 we were able to offset these increases
 in part as a result of our 2019 pricing strategy that included both list price increases as well as a trade spend optimization program. Separately
We plan to continue managing inflation risk by entering into short term supply contracts and advance commodities purchase agreements from time to time
 and
 if necessary
 by raising prices. To the extent we are unable to avoid or offset any present or future cost increases by locking in our costs
 implementing cost saving measures or increasing prices to our customers
 our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. In addition
 if input costs begin to decline
 customers may look for price reductions in situations where we have locked into purchases at higher costs. During the past three years
 our cost saving measures and sales price increases have not been sufficient to fully offset increases to our raw material

For the purposes of this table
 purchase obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services (such as raw materials
 commodities
 packaging
 other materials and supplies and co-manufacturing arrangements) that are enforceable and legally binding on B&amp;G Foods and that specify all significant terms
 including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed
 minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligations in the above table do not represent our entire expected future purchases for goods and services
 which are significantly higher than the amounts set forth above. The table does not include purchase obligations under contracts that may be cancelled by B&amp;G&#160;Foods without material penalty. Any amounts reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the purchase obligations set forth in the table above. Penalties
 if any
 related to molds and equipment based upon failure to meet minimum volume requirements are also excluded from the table because we are unable to determine whether such penalties will be incurred and
 if incurred
We expect to make $4.9 million of defined benefit pension plan contributions during fiscal 2020

Our foreign sales are primarily to customers in Canada. Our sales to Canada are generally denominated in Canadian dollars and our sales for export to other countries are generally denominated in U.S. dollars. During fiscal 2019
 2018 and 2017
 our net sales to customers in foreign countries represented approximately 7.7%
 7.3% and 6.3%
 respectively
 of our total net sales. We also purchase certain raw materials from foreign suppliers. For example
 we purchase a significant majority of our maple syrup requirements from suppliers in Qu&#233;bec
 Canada. These purchases are made in Canadian dollars. A weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Canadian dollar would significantly increase our future costs relating to the production of our maple syrup products to the extent we have not purchased Canadian dollars or otherwise entered into a currency hedging arrangement in advance of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar. Our purchases of raw materials from other foreign suppliers are generally denominated in U.S. dollars
As a result
 certain revenues and expenses have been

 as listed above
&#8217;s historical customer attrition data. We assessed the assumptions for comparison to those of a market participant

 including controls related to the determination of the fair values of the indefinite-lived intangible assets
 related revenue growth rates
 and determination of the WACC. We performed sensitivity analyses over the revenue growth rates assumption to assess their impact on the Company&#8217;s determination that the fair values of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying values. We evaluated the Company&#8217;s revenue growth rates by comparing them to historical results
 economic and industry growth rates. In addition
 we compared the Company&#8217;s historical revenue forecasts to actual results. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skill and knowledge

The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
 assessing the risk that a material weakness exists
 and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)&#160;pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&#160;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)&#160;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions made by management involve revenue recognition as it relates to trade and consumer promotion expenses; pension benefits; acquisition accounting fair value allocations; the recoverability of goodwill

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (trademarks) are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. We perform the annual impairment tests as of the last day of each fiscal year. The annual goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing our company&#8217;s market capitalization with our company&#8217;s carrying value
 including goodwill. If the carrying value of our company exceeds our market capitalization
Calculating our fair value for these purposes requires significant estimates and assumptions by management. We completed our annual impairment tests for fiscal 2019

Revenues are recognized when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation is satisfied when products are shipped. We report all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction as revenue
 including those amounts related to shipping and handling. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold. Consideration from a vendor to a retailer is presumed to be a reduction to the selling prices of the vendor&#8217;s products and
 therefore
 is characterized as a reduction of sales when recognized in the vendor&#8217;s income statement. As a result
 coupon incentives
 slotting and promotional expenses are recorded as a reduction of sales. Additionally

% of our employees. Our funding policy is to contribute annually the amount recommended by our actuaries. From time to time
 however
 we voluntarily contribute greater amounts based on pension asset performance
We provide compensation benefits in the form of stock options
 performance share long-term incentive awards (LTIAs) and common stock to employees and non-employee directors. The cost of share-based compensation is recorded at fair value at the date of grant and expensed in our consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period
Performance share LTIAs granted to our executive officers and certain other members of senior management entitle each participant to earn shares of common stock upon the attainment of certain performance goals over the applicable performance period. The recognition of compensation expense for the performance share LTIAs is initially based on the probable outcome of the performance condition based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant and the anticipated number of shares to be awarded on a straight-line basis over the applicable performance period. The fair value of the awards on the date of grant is determined based upon the closing price of our common stock on the applicable measurement dates (i.e.
 the deemed grant dates for accounting purposes) reduced by the present value of expected dividends using the risk-free interest-rate as the award holders are not entitled to dividends or dividend equivalents during the vesting period. Our company&#8217;s performance against the defined performance goals are re-evaluated on a quarterly basis throughout the applicable performance period and the recognition of compensation expense is adjusted for subsequent changes in the estimated or actual outcome. The cumulative effect of a change in the estimated number of shares of common stock to be issued in respect of performance share awards is recognized as an adjustment to earnings in the period of the revision.

The fair value of stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized in expense over the vesting period of the options using the straight-line method. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires various assumptions
 including the expected volatility of our stock
 the expected term of the option
We recognize compensation expense for only that portion of share-based awards that are expected to vest. We utilize historical employee termination behavior to determine our estimated forfeiture rates. If the actual forfeitures differ from those estimated by management
As part of the income tax provision process of preparing our consolidated financial statements
 we are required to estimate our income taxes. This process involves estimating our current tax expenses together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe the recovery is not likely
 we establish a valuation allowance. Further
 to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a financial accounting period
 we include such charge in our tax provision
 or reduce our tax benefits in our consolidated statements of operations. We use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes
There are various factors that may cause these tax assumptions to change in the near term
 and we may have to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. We cannot predict whether future U.S. federal and state income tax laws and regulations might be passed that could have a material effect on our results of operations. See Note&#160;10

In February 2018
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new accounting standards update (ASU) related to the U.S. Tax Act. The ASU allows for a company to elect to make a one-time reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the change in corporate tax rate as a result of the U.S. Tax Act. The reclassification is the difference between the amount previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the historical U.S. federal tax rate that remains in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the time the U.S. Tax Act was effective and the amount that would have been recorded using the newly enacted rate. Additionally
In February 2016
 the FASB issued a new ASU that requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under current guidance and to disclose key information about leasing arrangements. The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases. Leases will be classified as finance or operating
We adopted the new standard prospectively when it became effective in the first quarter of 2019 and applied the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We elected the &#8216;package of practical expedients&#8217;
 which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification
The new standard also provides practical expedients for an entity&#8217;s ongoing accounting. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. This means

In March 2017
 the FASB issued a new ASU that improves the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit costs. The new guidance revises how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans present the net periodic benefit costs in their income statement and requires that the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs be presented in the same income statement line items as other employee compensation costs from services rendered during the period and present the other components of net periodic pension cost below operating profit. The update was effective beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We adopted this standard retrospectively as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The adoption of this ASU did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position

In May 2014
 the FASB issued guidance on revenue recognition
 with final guidance issued in 2016. The guidance provides for a five-step model to determine the revenue to be recognized from the transfer of goods or services to customers. The guidance also requires improved disclosures to help users of the financial statements better understand the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows relating to customer contracts. It also provides clarification for principal versus agent considerations
 identifying performance obligations and the accounting of intellectual property licenses. In addition
 the FASB introduced practical expedients related to disclosures of remaining performance obligations
 as well as other amendments to guidance on collectability
We adopted this guidance and related amendments as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018
 applying the full retrospective transition method to all contracts. We concluded that the adoption of this standard primarily affected our policies and estimation methodologies of variable consideration associated with rebates and bill-backs
 product returns and cash discounts. The provisions of the new standard did not impact the timing of revenue recognition but did impact the classification of certain payments to customers
Our sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership
 risks and rewards transfer. Typically
 this occurs when the goods are shipped to the customer. Revenues are recognized in an amount that reflects the net consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods. We report all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction as revenue
 including those amounts related to shipping and handling. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold. Under the new revenue guidance
We promote our products with advertising
 consumer incentives and trade promotions. These programs include discounts
 slotting fees
 coupons
 rebates
Payment terms in our invoices are based on the billing schedule established in our contracts or purchase orders with customers. We generally recognize the related trade receivable when the goods are shipped. In certain cases
 we require a payment in advance of performance when the customer&#8217;s credit has not been established. We record these revenues as a contract liability; however
 these amounts have historically been immaterial.

In January 2017
 the FASB issued a new ASU that clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist companies with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The definition of a business may affect many areas of accounting
 including acquisitions
 disposals
 goodwill and consolidation. The ASU is applied on a prospective basis and was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017. We adopted this standard as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018

In August 2016
 the FASB issued a new ASU to provide guidance on eight specific cash flow classification issues and reduce diversity in practice in how some cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified on the statement of cash flows. The ASU was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017. We adopted this standard as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018
In March 2016
 the FASB issued a new ASU that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance requires that excess tax benefits (which represent the excess of actual tax benefits received at the date of vesting or settlement over the benefits recognized over the vesting period or upon issuance of share-based payments) and tax deficiencies (which represent the amount by which actual tax benefits received at the date of vesting or settlement is lower than the benefits recognized over the vesting period or upon issuance of share-based payments) be recorded in the income statement as a reduction of income taxes when the awards vest or are settled. The new guidance also requires excess tax benefits to be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity. As a result of this adoption
 million in the income taxes line item of our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2017 related to excess tax benefits upon vesting or settlement in that period. We elected to adopt the cash flow presentation of the excess tax benefits prospectively
 commencing with our statement of cash flows for the first quarter of 2017
 where we began classifying these benefits
 along with other income tax cash flows
 as an operating activity. We excluded the excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in the computation of our diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017.

 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to all periods presented. We intend to adopt the provisions of this ASU in the first quarter of 2020. Currently

The authoritative accounting literature relating to fair value measurements defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The accounting literature outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy in order to increase the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and the related disclosures. Under GAAP
 certain assets and liabilities must be measured at fair value

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets
 management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income and reversal of deferred tax liabilities over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible

December 29
The overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is based upon a building-block method
 whereby the expected rate of return on each asset class is broken down into the following components: (1)&#160;inflation; (2)&#160;the real risk-free rate of return (i.e.
 the long-term estimate of future returns on default-free U.S. government securities); and (3) the risk premium for each asset class (i.e.
All three components are based primarily on historical data
 with modest adjustments to take into account additional relevant information that is currently available. For the inflation and risk-free return components
 the most significant additional information is that provided by the market for nominal and inflation-indexed U.S. Treasury securities. That market provides implied forecasts of both the inflation rate and risk-free rate for the period over which currently available securities mature. The historical data on risk premiums for each asset class is adjusted to reflect any systemic changes that have occurred in the relevant markets; e.g.
 the higher current valuations for equities

We were notified that for the plan year beginning January 1
 2012
 the plan was in critical status and classified in the Red Zone
 and for the plan year beginning January 1
 2018
 the plan was in critical and declining status. As of the date of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements
 the plan remains in critical and declining status. The law requires that all contributing employers pay to the plan a surcharge to help correct the plan&#8217;s financial situation. The amount of the surcharge is equal to a percentage of the amount an employer is otherwise required to contribute to the plan under the applicable collective bargaining agreement. During the second quarter of 2015
 we agreed to a collective bargaining agreement that
 among other things
 implements a rehabilitation plan. As a result

We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the normal course of business. We did not make any material expenditures during fiscal 2019
 2018 or 2017 in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Based on our experience to date
 management believes that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations (and liability for any known environmental conditions) will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
 results of operations or liquidity. However
 we cannot predict what environmental or health and safety legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced
 administered or interpreted

As required by Rule&#160;13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended
 our management
 including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer
 conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. As defined in Rules&#160;13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act
 disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that we use that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer
 as appropriate
Based on that evaluation
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
 as such term is defined in Rules&#160;13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management
 including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer
Based on our evaluation under the framework of Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework (2013)
 our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 28
 2019. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 28
 2019 was audited by KPMG&#160;LLP
 an independent registered public accounting firm
 as stated in their report which is included in Part&#160;II
 Item&#160;8
Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. All internal control systems
 no matter how well designed
 have inherent limitations. Therefore
 even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 acquisition on May 15
 business from our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting as of December 28
 business represent approximately 2.9% and 3.2%
 respectively
As required by Rule&#160;13a-15(d) under the Exchange Act
 our management
 including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer
 also conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last quarter of fiscal 2019 that has materially affected
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation
 our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the last quarter of fiscal 2019 that has materially affected
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.
We transitioned the spices &amp; seasonings business that we acquired in late 2016 to a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system during the third quarter of 2017. Since then
 we have been planning for and working on the transition of the remainder of our business to that new ERP system. Implementation
 integration and transition efforts for the remainder of our business (other than our Mexican operations) continued during fiscal 2019 and was substantially completed during the second quarter of 2019. We plan to implement additional modules to the ERP system during fiscal 2020 and we plan to transition our Mexican operations to the new ERP system by the end of 2021. In connection with the implementation
 integration and transition
 and resulting business process changes
 we continue to review and enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting following the completion of the implementation
 integration and transition. To date
 the implementation
 integration and transition have not materially affected and
 upon completion we do not expect the implementation
 integration and transition to have any material effect on
Our company&#8217;s management
 including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer
 does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system
 no matter how well designed and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance that the control system&#8217;s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
 and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further
 because of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
 within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons
 by collusion of two or more people
 or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
 and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time

The estimated measure of the percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of B&amp;G Foods
 Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year&#8217;s presentation. See (r)
&#8221; below for further details.




The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions made by management involve revenue recognition as it relates to trade and consumer promotion expenses; pension benefits; acquisition accounting fair value allocations; the recoverability of goodwill
 other intangible assets
 property
Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances
 including the current economic environment. We adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Volatility in the credit and equity markets can increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.









For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows
 all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less when acquired are considered to be cash and cash equivalents.




Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and include direct material
 direct labor
 overhead
 warehousing and product transfer costs. Cost is determined using the first-in
 first-out and average cost methods. Inventories have been reduced by an allowance for excess
 obsolete and unsaleable inventories. The allowance is an estimate based on our management&#8217;s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales.



Property
 Plant and Equipment
Property
Property
 plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation on plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets
 10 to 30 years for buildings and improvements
 5 to 12 years for machinery and equipment
 and 2 to 5 years for office furniture and vehicles. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset. Expenditures for maintenance
 repairs and minor replacements are charged to current operations. Expenditures for major replacements and betterments are capitalized. We capitalize interest on qualifying assets based on our effective interest rate. During fiscal 2019
 2018 and 2017
 we capitalized $1.1 million
 $1.1 million and $1.0 million
 respectively.




Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (trademarks) are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. We perform the annual impairment tests as of the last day of each fiscal year. The annual goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing our company&#8217;s market capitalization with our company&#8217;s carrying value
 including goodwill. If the carrying value of our company exceeds our market capitalization
Calculating our fair value for these purposes requires significant estimates and assumptions by management. We completed our annual impairment tests for fiscal 2019
 2018 and 2017 with no adjustments to the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Each annual test confirmed that the market capitalization and fair values of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
 respectively
Customer relationships and finite-lived trademarks are presented at cost
 net of accumulated amortization
Seed technology assets are presented at cost
 net of accumulated amortization
 and are amortized utilizing a declining balance approach over their estimated useful lives of 5 years. During fiscal 2017
 we sold to a third-party co-packer our Le&#160;Sueur
 Minnesota research center
 including the seed technology assets
 property
 plant and equipment
 acquisition
 resulting in a $1.6 million pre-tax loss on sale of assets.




Debt financing costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related debt agreements and are included as a reduction of long-term debt. Amortization of deferred debt financing costs for fiscal 2019
 2018 and 2017 was $3.5 million
 $5.3 million and $5.4 million
 respectively.




Long-lived assets
 such as property
 plant and equipment
 and intangible assets with estimated useful lives
 are depreciated or amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values
 and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future net cash flows
 an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to their fair value less estimated costs to sell. Estimating future cash flows and calculating the fair value of assets requires significant estimates and assumptions by management.




Accumulated other comprehensive loss includes foreign currency translation adjustments relating to assets and liabilities located in our foreign subsidiaries and changes in our pension benefits due to the initial adoption and ongoing application of the authoritative accounting literature relating to pensions
 net of tax. 




Revenues are recognized when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation is satisfied when products are shipped. We report all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction as revenue
 including those amounts related to shipping and handling. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold. Consideration from a vendor to a retailer is presumed to be a reduction to the selling prices of the vendor&#8217;s products and
 therefore
 is characterized as a reduction of sales when recognized in the vendor&#8217;s income statement. As a result
 coupon incentives
 slotting and promotional expenses are recorded as a reduction of sales. Additionally
 as a result of the recently adopted revenue recognition standard
 certain payments to customers related to in-store display incentives
 or marketing development funds
 are also recorded as a reduction of sales. See (r) &#8220;
&#8221; below
 for further details regarding the revenue recognition standard adopted in fiscal 2018.



Selling
 General and Administrative Expenses
Selling
We promote our products with advertising
 consumer incentives and trade promotions. These programs include
 but are not limited to
 discounts
 slotting fees
 coupons
 rebates
 in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives. Consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. We expense our advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred. Advertising expenses were approximately $7.8 million
 $15.9 million and $22.7 million
 for fiscal 2019
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.




We have defined benefit pension plans covering approximately 39.7% of our employees. Our funding policy is to contribute annually the amount recommended by our actuaries. From time to time
 however
 we voluntarily contribute greater amounts based on pension asset performance
 tax considerations and other relevant factors.




We provide compensation benefits in the form of stock options
 performance share long-term incentive awards (LTIAs) and common stock to employees and non-employee directors. The cost of share-based compensation is recorded at fair value at the date of grant and expensed in our consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period
Performance share LTIAs granted to our executive officers and certain other members of senior management entitle each participant to earn shares of common stock upon the attainment of certain performance goals over the applicable performance period. The recognition of compensation expense for the performance share LTIAs is initially based on the probable outcome of the performance condition based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant and the anticipated number of shares to be awarded on a straight-line basis over the applicable performance period. The fair value of the awards on the date of grant is determined based upon the closing price of our common stock on the applicable measurement dates (i.e.
The fair value of stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized in expense over the vesting period of the options using the straight-line method. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires various assumptions
 including the expected volatility of our stock
 the expected term of the option
We recognize compensation expense for only that portion of share-based awards that are expected to vest. We utilize historical employee termination behavior to determine our estimated forfeiture rates. If the actual forfeitures differ from those estimated by management
 adjustments to compensation expense will be made in future periods.




As part of the income tax provision process of preparing our consolidated financial statements
 we are required to estimate our income taxes. This process involves estimating our current tax expenses together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe the recovery is not likely
 we establish a valuation allowance. Further
 to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a financial accounting period
 we include such charge in our tax provision
 or reduce our tax benefits in our consolidated statements of operations. We use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes
There are various factors that may cause these tax assumptions to change in the near term
 and we may have to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. We cannot predict whether future U.S. federal and state income tax laws and regulations might be passed that could have a material effect on our results of operations. See Note&#160;10
 &#8220;Income Taxes
&#8221; for a discussion of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017
 which we refer to in this report as the &#8220;U.S. Tax Act.&#8221; We assess the impact of significant changes to the U.S. federal
 state and international income tax laws and regulations on a regular basis and update the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our consolidated financial statements when new regulations and legislation are enacted. We recognize the benefit of an uncertain tax position that we have taken or expect to take on our income tax returns we file if it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that such tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits.




Cash dividends
 if any
 are accrued as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets and recorded as a decrease to additional paid-in capital when declared.

In February 2018
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new accounting standards update (ASU) related to the U.S. Tax Act. The ASU allows for a company to elect to make a one-time reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the change in corporate tax rate as a result of the U.S. Tax Act. The reclassification is the difference between the amount previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the historical U.S. federal tax rate that remains in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the time the U.S. Tax Act was effective and the amount that would have been recorded using the newly enacted rate. Additionally
In February 2016
 the FASB issued a new ASU that requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under current guidance and to disclose key information about leasing arrangements. The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases. Leases will be classified as finance or operating
We adopted the new standard prospectively when it became effective in the first quarter of 2019 and applied the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We elected the &#8216;package of practical expedients&#8217;
 which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification
The new standard also provides practical expedients for an entity&#8217;s ongoing accounting. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. This means
twelve months or less
This standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements. Upon adoption
 the most significant effects related to (1) the recognition of new ROU assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet for our operating leases
 which was $39.6 million and $42.6 million
 respectively
In March 2017
 the FASB issued a new ASU that improves the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit costs. The new guidance revises how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans present the net periodic benefit costs in their income statement and requires that the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs be presented in the same income statement line items as other employee compensation costs from services rendered during the period and present the other components of net periodic pension cost below operating profit. The update was effective beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We adopted this standard retrospectively as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The adoption of this ASU did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position
 results of operations or liquidity
 but did require a reclassification among selling
In May 2014
 the FASB issued guidance on revenue recognition
 with final guidance issued in 2016. The guidance provides for a five-step model to determine the revenue to be recognized from the transfer of goods or services to customers. The guidance also requires improved disclosures to help users of the financial statements better understand the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows relating to customer contracts. It also provides clarification for principal versus agent considerations
 identifying performance obligations and the accounting of intellectual property licenses. In addition
 the FASB introduced practical expedients related to disclosures of remaining performance obligations
 as well as other amendments to guidance on collectability
We adopted this guidance and related amendments as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018
 applying the full retrospective transition method to all contracts. We concluded that the adoption of this standard primarily affected our policies and estimation methodologies of variable consideration associated with rebates and bill-backs
 product returns and cash discounts. The provisions of the new standard did not impact the timing of revenue recognition but did impact the classification of certain payments to customers
Our sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership
 risks and rewards transfer. Typically
 this occurs when the goods are shipped to the customer. Revenues are recognized in an amount that reflects the net consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods. We report all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction as revenue
 including those amounts related to shipping and handling. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold. Under the new revenue guidance
We promote our products with advertising
 consumer incentives and trade promotions. These programs include discounts
 slotting fees
 coupons
 rebates
Payment terms in our invoices are based on the billing schedule established in our contracts or purchase orders with customers. We generally recognize the related trade receivable when the goods are shipped. In certain cases
 we require a payment in advance of performance when the customer&#8217;s credit has not been established. We record these revenues as a contract liability; however

In January 2017
 the FASB issued a new ASU that clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist companies with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The definition of a business may affect many areas of accounting
 including acquisitions
 disposals
 goodwill and consolidation. The ASU is applied on a prospective basis and was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017. We adopted this standard as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018
 and there was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements. We applied this ASU while evaluating whether

 2018
 Pirate Brands
 sold on October 17
 2018 and 
 acquired on May&#160;15
&#160;2019
 met the definition of a business. See Note 3
In August 2016
 the FASB issued a new ASU to provide guidance on eight specific cash flow classification issues and reduce diversity in practice in how some cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified on the statement of cash flows. The ASU was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017. We adopted this standard as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018
In March 2016
 the FASB issued a new ASU that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance requires that excess tax benefits (which represent the excess of actual tax benefits received at the date of vesting or settlement over the benefits recognized over the vesting period or upon issuance of share-based payments) and tax deficiencies (which represent the amount by which actual tax benefits received at the date of vesting or settlement is lower than the benefits recognized over the vesting period or upon issuance of share-based payments) be recorded in the income statement as a reduction of income taxes when the awards vest or are settled. The new guidance also requires excess tax benefits to be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity. As a result of this adoption
 we recognized discrete tax benefits of $0.8 million in the income taxes line item of our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2017 related to excess tax benefits upon vesting or settlement in that period. We elected to adopt the cash flow presentation of the excess tax benefits prospectively
 commencing with our statement of cash flows for the first quarter of 2017
 where we began classifying these benefits
 along with other income tax cash flows
In November 2015
 the FASB issued a new ASU that requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The ASU was effective beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We adopted the provisions of this ASU at the beginning of fiscal 2017 and applied the required changes in accounting principle on a retrospective basis. The update impacted presentation and disclosure only
 and therefore
In July 2015
 the FASB issued a new ASU that simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by replacing the current lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost and net realizable value test. We adopted the provisions of this ASU at the beginning of fiscal 2017. The adoption of this ASU did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position
In June 2016
 the FASB issued a new ASU which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. This ASU replaces the incurred loss methodology for recognizing credit losses with a current expected credit losses model and applies to all financial assets
 including trade accounts receivables. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to all periods presented. We intend to adopt the provisions of this ASU in the first quarter of 2020. Currently
In December 2019
 the FASB issued a new ASU which removes certain exceptions for recognizing deferred taxes for investments
 performing intraperiod allocation and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The ASU also adds guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas
 including recognizing deferred taxes for goodwill and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2020. Early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in any interim period. We currently expect to adopt the standard when it becomes effective. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU. Currently
In August 2018
 the FASB issued a new ASU which clarifies that implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing arrangements are deferred if they would be capitalized by customers in software licensing arrangements under the internal-use software guidance. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&#160;15
 2019. Early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in any interim period. Currently
In August 2018
 the FASB issued a new ASU that aims to improve the overall usefulness of disclosures to financial statement users and reduce unnecessary costs to companies by changing disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other post-retirement plans. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
In August 2018
 the FASB issued a new ASU that aims to improve the overall usefulness of disclosures to financial statement users and reduce unnecessary costs to companies by changing disclosure requirements for fair value measurement. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
In January 2017
 the FASB issued an amendment to the standards of goodwill impairment testing. The new guidance simplifies the test for goodwill impairment
 by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value; however
 the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally
 an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss
 if applicable. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019. We expect to adopt the standards when they become effective.




During fiscal 2019
 we reclassified unamortized deferred debt financing costs of $3.0 million related to our revolving credit facility as of December 29
 2018 from a reduction in long-term debt to other assets in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

 we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We have lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. With the exception of our real estate leases
 we account for our leases as a single lease component. See Note 2
 &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8212; 
The following table shows the lease term and discount rate for our ROU assets as of December 28

 we had four company-sponsored defined benefit pension plans covering approximately 39.7% of our employees. The benefits are based on years of service and the employee&#8217;s compensation
 as defined. Effective January&#160;1

The assumptions used in the measurement of our benefit obligation as of December 28
 2019 and December&#160;29
December 28
December 29
The overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is based upon a building-block method
 whereby the expected rate of return on each asset class is broken down into the following components: (1)&#160;inflation; (2)&#160;the real risk-free rate of return (i.e.
 the long-term estimate of future returns on default-free U.S. government securities); and (3) the risk premium for each asset class (i.e.
All three components are based primarily on historical data
 with modest adjustments to take into account additional relevant information that is currently available. For the inflation and risk-free return components
 the most significant additional information is that provided by the market for nominal and inflation-indexed U.S. Treasury securities. That market provides implied forecasts of both the inflation rate and risk-free rate for the period over which currently available securities mature. The historical data on risk premiums for each asset class is adjusted to reflect any systemic changes that have occurred in the relevant markets; e.g.
 the higher current valuations for equities
 as a multiple of earnings

The general investment objective of each of the pension plans is to grow the plan assets in relation to the plan liabilities while prudently managing the risk of a decrease in the plan&#8217;s assets relative to those liabilities. To meet this objective

The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of common stocks
 bonds
 cash equivalents and other investments
 which may reflect varying rates of return. The investments are further diversified within each asset classification. The portfolio diversification provides protection against a single security or class of securities having a disproportionate impact on aggregate performance.

We also sponsor defined contribution plans covering substantially all of our employees. Employees may contribute to these plans and these contributions are matched by us at varying amounts. Contributions for the matching component of these plans amounted to $1.9 million
 $1.7 million and $1.6 million for fiscal 2019
 2018 and 2017
During the second quarter of 2018
 our defined benefit pension plans purchased 227
667 shares of our company&#8217;s common stock at an average price per share (excluding fees and commissions) of $28.27
We also contribute to the Bakery and Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund (EIN 52-6118572
 Plan No. 001)
 a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan
 sponsored by the Bakery
 Confectionery
 Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union (BCTGM) on behalf of certain employees at our Portland
We were notified that for the plan year beginning January 1
 2012
 the plan was in critical status and classified in the Red Zone
 and for the plan year beginning January 1
 2018
 the plan was in critical and declining status. As of the date of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements
 the plan remains in critical and declining status. The law requires that all contributing employers pay to the plan a surcharge to help correct the plan&#8217;s financial situation. The amount of the surcharge is equal to a percentage of the amount an employer is otherwise required to contribute to the plan under the applicable collective bargaining agreement. During the second quarter of 2015
 we agreed to a collective bargaining agreement that
 among other things
 implements a rehabilitation plan. As a result
 our contributions to the plan are expected to increase by at least 5.0% per year
B&amp;G Foods made contributions to the plan of $0.9 million
 $0.8 million and $0.9 million in fiscal 2019
 2018 and 2017
 respectively. In fiscal 2019 we paid less than $0.3 million in surcharges and in each of fiscal 2018 and 2017
 we paid less than $0.1 million in surcharges. In fiscal 2020 we expect to make $0.9 million of contributions and we expect to pay surcharges of less than $0.3 million in assuming consistent hours are worked. These contributions represented less than five percent of total contributions made to the plan.

The authoritative accounting literature relating to fair value measurements defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The accounting literature outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy in order to increase the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and the related disclosures. Under GAAP
 certain assets and liabilities must be measured at fair value
Level 2&#8212;Observable inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices
 such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value driver is observable for the asset or liability

We are from time to time involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business
 including proceedings involving product liability claims
 product labeling claims
 worker&#8217;s compensation and other employee claims
 and tort and other general liability claims
 as well as trademark
 copyright
 patent infringement and related claims and legal actions. While we cannot predict with certainty the results of these claims and legal actions in which we are currently or in the future may be involved
 we do not expect that the ultimate disposition of any currently pending claims or actions will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the normal course of business. We did not make any material expenditures during fiscal 2019
 2018 or 2017 in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Based on our experience to date
 management believes that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations (and liability for any known environmental conditions) will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
 results of operations or liquidity. However
 we cannot predict what environmental or health and safety legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced
 administered or interpreted
As of December 28
 2019
 1
813 of our 2
899 employees
 or approximately 62.5%
 were covered by collective bargaining agreements. The collective bargaining agreement covering employees at our Brooklyn
 New York facility
 which covers approximately 55 employees
 expired on December&#160;31
&#160;2019. During January 2020
 we reached an agreement in principle with the United Food and Commercial Workers Union
 Local No. 342
 to extend the collective bargaining agreement for an additional four-year period ending December&#160;21
Three of our collective bargaining agreements expire in the next twelve months. The collective bargaining agreement covering our Terre&#160;Haute facility
 which covers approximately 100&#160;employees
 is scheduled to expire on March 27
 2020; the collective bargaining agreement covering our Roseland facility
 which covers approximately 50 employees
 is scheduled to expire on March 31
 2020; and the collective bargaining agreement covering our Ankeny facility
 which covers approximately 275 employees
 is scheduled to expire on April 5
While we believe that our relations with our union employees are in general good
 we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements for our Terre&#160;Haute
 Roseland and Ankeny facilities on terms satisfactory to us
 or at all
 and without production interruptions
 including labor stoppages. At this time
 however
 management does not expect that the outcome of these negotiations will have a material adverse impact on our business
We have employment agreements with each of our executive officers. The agreements generally continue until terminated by the executive or by us
 and provide for severance payments under certain circumstances
 including termination by us without cause (as defined in the agreements) or as a result of the employee&#8217;s death or disability
 or termination by us or a deemed termination upon a change of control (as defined in the agreements). Severance benefits generally include payments for salary continuation
 continuation of health care and insurance benefits
 present value of additional pension credits and
 in the case of a change of control
 accelerated vesting under compensation plans and
 in certain cases
 potential gross up payments for excise tax liability.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of B&amp;G Foods
 Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year&#8217;s presentation. See (r)
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions made by management involve revenue recognition as it relates to trade and consumer promotion expenses; pension benefits; acquisition accounting fair value allocations; the recoverability of goodwill
 other intangible assets
 property
Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances
For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and include direct material
 direct labor
 overhead
 warehousing and product transfer costs. Cost is determined using the first-in
 first-out and average cost methods. Inventories have been reduced by an allowance for excess
Property
Property
 plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation on plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets
 10 to 30 years for buildings and improvements
 5 to 12 years for machinery and equipment
 and 2 to 5 years for office furniture and vehicles. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset. Expenditures for maintenance
 repairs and minor replacements are charged to current operations. Expenditures for major replacements and betterments are capitalized. We capitalize interest on qualifying assets based on our effective interest rate. During fiscal 2019
 2018 and 2017
 we capitalized $1.1 million
 $1.1 million and $1.0 million
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (trademarks) are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. We perform the annual impairment tests as of the last day of each fiscal year. The annual goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing our company&#8217;s market capitalization with our company&#8217;s carrying value
 including goodwill. If the carrying value of our company exceeds our market capitalization
Calculating our fair value for these purposes requires significant estimates and assumptions by management. We completed our annual impairment tests for fiscal 2019
 2018 and 2017 with no adjustments to the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Each annual test confirmed that the market capitalization and fair values of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
 respectively
Customer relationships and finite-lived trademarks are presented at cost
 net of accumulated amortization
Seed technology assets are presented at cost
 net of accumulated amortization
 and are amortized utilizing a declining balance approach over their estimated useful lives of 5 years. During fiscal 2017
 we sold to a third-party co-packer our Le&#160;Sueur
 Minnesota research center
 including the seed technology assets
 property
 plant and equipment
 acquisition
Debt financing costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related debt agreements and are included as a reduction of long-term debt. Amortization of deferred debt financing costs for fiscal 2019
 2018 and 2017 was $3.5 million
 $5.3 million and $5.4 million
Long-lived assets
 such as property
 plant and equipment
 and intangible assets with estimated useful lives
 are depreciated or amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values
 and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future net cash flows
Accumulated other comprehensive loss includes foreign currency translation adjustments relating to assets and liabilities located in our foreign subsidiaries and changes in our pension benefits due to the initial adoption and ongoing application of the authoritative accounting literature relating to pensions
Revenues are recognized when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation is satisfied when products are shipped. We report all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction as revenue
 including those amounts related to shipping and handling. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold. Consideration from a vendor to a retailer is presumed to be a reduction to the selling prices of the vendor&#8217;s products and
 therefore
 is characterized as a reduction of sales when recognized in the vendor&#8217;s income statement. As a result
 coupon incentives
 slotting and promotional expenses are recorded as a reduction of sales. Additionally
 as a result of the recently adopted revenue recognition standard
 certain payments to customers related to in-store display incentives
 or marketing development funds
 are also recorded as a reduction of sales. See (r) &#8220;
&#8221; below
Selling
We promote our products with advertising
 consumer incentives and trade promotions. These programs include
 but are not limited to
 discounts
 slotting fees
 coupons
 rebates
 in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives. Consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. We expense our advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred. Advertising expenses were approximately $7.8 million
 $15.9 million and $22.7 million
 for fiscal 2019
 2018 and 2017
We have defined benefit pension plans covering approximately 39.7% of our employees. Our funding policy is to contribute annually the amount recommended by our actuaries. From time to time
 however
 we voluntarily contribute greater amounts based on pension asset performance
We provide compensation benefits in the form of stock options
 performance share long-term incentive awards (LTIAs) and common stock to employees and non-employee directors. The cost of share-based compensation is recorded at fair value at the date of grant and expensed in our consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period
Performance share LTIAs granted to our executive officers and certain other members of senior management entitle each participant to earn shares of common stock upon the attainment of certain performance goals over the applicable performance period. The recognition of compensation expense for the performance share LTIAs is initially based on the probable outcome of the performance condition based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant and the anticipated number of shares to be awarded on a straight-line basis over the applicable performance period. The fair value of the awards on the date of grant is determined based upon the closing price of our common stock on the applicable measurement dates (i.e.
The fair value of stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized in expense over the vesting period of the options using the straight-line method. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires various assumptions
 including the expected volatility of our stock
 the expected term of the option
We recognize compensation expense for only that portion of share-based awards that are expected to vest. We utilize historical employee termination behavior to determine our estimated forfeiture rates. If the actual forfeitures differ from those estimated by management
As part of the income tax provision process of preparing our consolidated financial statements
 we are required to estimate our income taxes. This process involves estimating our current tax expenses together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe the recovery is not likely
 we establish a valuation allowance. Further
 to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a financial accounting period
 we include such charge in our tax provision
 or reduce our tax benefits in our consolidated statements of operations. We use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes
There are various factors that may cause these tax assumptions to change in the near term
 and we may have to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. We cannot predict whether future U.S. federal and state income tax laws and regulations might be passed that could have a material effect on our results of operations. See Note&#160;10
 &#8220;Income Taxes
&#8221; for a discussion of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017

In February 2018
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new accounting standards update (ASU) related to the U.S. Tax Act. The ASU allows for a company to elect to make a one-time reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the change in corporate tax rate as a result of the U.S. Tax Act. The reclassification is the difference between the amount previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the historical U.S. federal tax rate that remains in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the time the U.S. Tax Act was effective and the amount that would have been recorded using the newly enacted rate. Additionally
In February 2016
 the FASB issued a new ASU that requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under current guidance and to disclose key information about leasing arrangements. The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases. Leases will be classified as finance or operating
We adopted the new standard prospectively when it became effective in the first quarter of 2019 and applied the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We elected the &#8216;package of practical expedients&#8217;
 which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification
The new standard also provides practical expedients for an entity&#8217;s ongoing accounting. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. This means
twelve months or less
This standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements. Upon adoption
 the most significant effects related to (1) the recognition of new ROU assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet for our operating leases
 which was $39.6 million and $42.6 million
 respectively
In March 2017
 the FASB issued a new ASU that improves the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit costs. The new guidance revises how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans present the net periodic benefit costs in their income statement and requires that the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs be presented in the same income statement line items as other employee compensation costs from services rendered during the period and present the other components of net periodic pension cost below operating profit. The update was effective beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We adopted this standard retrospectively as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The adoption of this ASU did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position
 results of operations or liquidity
 but did require a reclassification among selling
In May 2014
 the FASB issued guidance on revenue recognition
 with final guidance issued in 2016. The guidance provides for a five-step model to determine the revenue to be recognized from the transfer of goods or services to customers. The guidance also requires improved disclosures to help users of the financial statements better understand the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows relating to customer contracts. It also provides clarification for principal versus agent considerations
 identifying performance obligations and the accounting of intellectual property licenses. In addition
 the FASB introduced practical expedients related to disclosures of remaining performance obligations
 as well as other amendments to guidance on collectability
We adopted this guidance and related amendments as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018
 applying the full retrospective transition method to all contracts. We concluded that the adoption of this standard primarily affected our policies and estimation methodologies of variable consideration associated with rebates and bill-backs
 product returns and cash discounts. The provisions of the new standard did not impact the timing of revenue recognition but did impact the classification of certain payments to customers
Our sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership
 risks and rewards transfer. Typically
 this occurs when the goods are shipped to the customer. Revenues are recognized in an amount that reflects the net consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods. We report all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction as revenue
 including those amounts related to shipping and handling. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold. Under the new revenue guidance
We promote our products with advertising
 consumer incentives and trade promotions. These programs include discounts
 slotting fees
 coupons
 rebates
Payment terms in our invoices are based on the billing schedule established in our contracts or purchase orders with customers. We generally recognize the related trade receivable when the goods are shipped. In certain cases
 we require a payment in advance of performance when the customer&#8217;s credit has not been established. We record these revenues as a contract liability; however

In January 2017
 the FASB issued a new ASU that clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist companies with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The definition of a business may affect many areas of accounting
 including acquisitions
 disposals
 goodwill and consolidation. The ASU is applied on a prospective basis and was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017. We adopted this standard as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018
 and there was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements. We applied this ASU while evaluating whether

&#160;2019
 met the definition of a business. See Note 3
In August 2016
 the FASB issued a new ASU to provide guidance on eight specific cash flow classification issues and reduce diversity in practice in how some cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified on the statement of cash flows. The ASU was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017. We adopted this standard as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018
In March 2016
 the FASB issued a new ASU that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance requires that excess tax benefits (which represent the excess of actual tax benefits received at the date of vesting or settlement over the benefits recognized over the vesting period or upon issuance of share-based payments) and tax deficiencies (which represent the amount by which actual tax benefits received at the date of vesting or settlement is lower than the benefits recognized over the vesting period or upon issuance of share-based payments) be recorded in the income statement as a reduction of income taxes when the awards vest or are settled. The new guidance also requires excess tax benefits to be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity. As a result of this adoption
 we recognized discrete tax benefits of $0.8 million in the income taxes line item of our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2017 related to excess tax benefits upon vesting or settlement in that period. We elected to adopt the cash flow presentation of the excess tax benefits prospectively
 commencing with our statement of cash flows for the first quarter of 2017
 where we began classifying these benefits
 along with other income tax cash flows
In November 2015
 the FASB issued a new ASU that requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The ASU was effective beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We adopted the provisions of this ASU at the beginning of fiscal 2017 and applied the required changes in accounting principle on a retrospective basis. The update impacted presentation and disclosure only
 and therefore
In July 2015
 the FASB issued a new ASU that simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by replacing the current lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost and net realizable value test. We adopted the provisions of this ASU at the beginning of fiscal 2017. The adoption of this ASU did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position
In June 2016
 the FASB issued a new ASU which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. This ASU replaces the incurred loss methodology for recognizing credit losses with a current expected credit losses model and applies to all financial assets
 including trade accounts receivables. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to all periods presented. We intend to adopt the provisions of this ASU in the first quarter of 2020. Currently
In December 2019
 the FASB issued a new ASU which removes certain exceptions for recognizing deferred taxes for investments
 performing intraperiod allocation and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The ASU also adds guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas
 including recognizing deferred taxes for goodwill and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2020. Early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in any interim period. We currently expect to adopt the standard when it becomes effective. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU. Currently
In August 2018
 the FASB issued a new ASU which clarifies that implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing arrangements are deferred if they would be capitalized by customers in software licensing arrangements under the internal-use software guidance. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&#160;15
 2019. Early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in any interim period. Currently
In August 2018
 the FASB issued a new ASU that aims to improve the overall usefulness of disclosures to financial statement users and reduce unnecessary costs to companies by changing disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other post-retirement plans. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
In August 2018
 the FASB issued a new ASU that aims to improve the overall usefulness of disclosures to financial statement users and reduce unnecessary costs to companies by changing disclosure requirements for fair value measurement. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
In January 2017
 the FASB issued an amendment to the standards of goodwill impairment testing. The new guidance simplifies the test for goodwill impairment
 by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value; however
 the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally
 an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss
 if applicable. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
During fiscal 2019
 we reclassified unamortized deferred debt financing costs of $3.0 million related to our revolving credit facility as of December 29
 2018 from a reduction in long-term debt to other assets in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets
 management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income and reversal of deferred tax liabilities over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible
 a valuation allowance of $1.7 million and $1.0 million was recorded during fiscal 2019 and 2018
 respectively
 to record only the portion of the deferred tax asset that management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences. There was no valuation allowance recorded during fiscal&#160;2017. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable
 however

We operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions within the United States
 Canada and Mexico and from time to time face audits from various tax authorities regarding the deductibility of certain expenses
 state income tax nexus
 intercompany transactions
 transfer pricing and other matters. Currently
 we are not undergoing any examinations by any tax authorities. We remain subject to examination in all of our tax jurisdictions until the applicable statutes of limitations expire. Fiscal 2015 and subsequent years remain open to examination. As of December 28

 President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
 which we refer to as the &#8220;U.S. Tax Act.&#8221; The U.S. Tax Act provides for significant changes in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended. The changes in the U.S. Tax Act are broad and complex and we continue to examine the impact the U.S. Tax Act may have on our business and financial results. The U.S. Tax Act contains provisions with separate effective dates but is generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31
Under FASB ASC Topic 740
 Income Taxes
 we are required to revalue any deferred tax assets or liabilities in the period of enactment of change in tax rates. Beginning on January 1
 2018
The reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% was effective for our fiscal 2018 and subsequent years. Our consolidated effective tax rate was approximately 27.7% and 22.4% for fiscal 2019 and fiscal&#160;2018
We also expect to realize a cash tax benefit for future bonus depreciation on certain business additions
 which
 together with the reduced income tax rate
adjusted taxable income. We were not impacted by this limitation in fiscal&#160;2018 due to the gain on the Pirate Brands sale which increased our adjusted taxable income. However
 in fiscal&#160;2019 this limitation resulted in an increase to our taxable income of $30.2 million and we accordingly established a deferred tax asset of $7.4 million without a valuation allowance. Although our interest expense exceeded 30% of our adjusted taxable income in fiscal&#160;2019
 at this time we do not believe this limitation has had
 or will have
The U.S. Treasury issued several regulations supplementing the U.S. Tax Act in 2018
 including detailed guidance clarifying the calculation of the mandatory tax on previously unrepatriated earnings
The ultimate impact of the U.S. Tax Act on our reported results in fiscal 2020 and beyond may differ from the estimates provided in this report
 possibly materially

 plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation on plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets
 10 to 30 years for buildings and improvements
 5 to 12 years for machinery and equipment
 and 2 to 5 years for office furniture and vehicles. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset. Expenditures for maintenance
 repairs and minor replacements are charged to current operations. Expenditures for major replacements and betterments are capitalized. We capitalize interest on qualifying assets based on our effective interest rate. During fiscal 2019
 2018 and 2017
 we capitalized $1.1 million
 $1.1 million and $1.0 million

 including goodwill. If the carrying value of our company exceeds our market capitalization

 2018 and 2017 with no adjustments to the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Each annual test confirmed that the market capitalization and fair values of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets

 such as property
 plant and equipment
 and intangible assets with estimated useful lives
 are depreciated or amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values

Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future net cash flows


 including those amounts related to shipping and handling. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold. Consideration from a vendor to a retailer is presumed to be a reduction to the selling prices of the vendor&#x2019;s products and
 therefore
 is characterized as a reduction of sales when recognized in the vendor&#x2019;s income statement. As a result
 coupon incentives
 slotting and promotional expenses are recorded as a reduction of sales. Additionally
 as a result of the recently adopted revenue recognition standard
 certain payments to customers related to in-store display incentives
 or marketing development funds
 are also recorded as a reduction of sales. See (r) &#x201c;&lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;Newly Adopted Accounting Standards&lt;/i&gt;

Consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. We expense our advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred.

The recognition of compensation expense for the performance share LTIAs is initially based on the probable outcome of the performance condition based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant and the anticipated number of shares to be awarded on a straight-line basis over the applicable performance period. The fair value of the awards on the date of grant is determined based upon the closing price of our common stock on the applicable measurement dates (i.e.
 the deemed grant dates for accounting purposes) reduced by the present value of expected dividends using the risk-free interest-rate as the award holders are not entitled to dividends or dividend equivalents during the vesting period. Our company&#x2019;s performance against the defined performance goals are re-evaluated on a quarterly basis throughout the applicable performance period and the recognition of compensation expense is adjusted for subsequent changes in the estimated or actual outcome. The cumulative effect of a change in the estimated number of shares of common stock to be issued in respect of performance share awards is recognized as an adjustment to earnings in the period of the revision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;The fair value of stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized in expense over the vesting period of the options using the straight-line method. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires various assumptions
 including the expected volatility of our stock
 the expected term of the option
 the risk-free interest rate and the expected dividend yield. Expected volatility is based on both historical and implied volatilities of our common stock over the estimated expected term of the award. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and have a 10-year term. Employee stock options cliff vest three years after the date of grant and non-employee director stock options vest one year after the date of grant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;We recognize compensation expense for only that portion of share-based awards that are expected to vest. We utilize historical employee termination behavior to determine our estimated forfeiture rates. If the actual forfeitures differ from those estimated by management

 we are required to estimate our income taxes. This process involves estimating our current tax expenses together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe the recovery is not likely
 we establish a valuation allowance. Further
 to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a financial accounting period
 we include such charge in our tax provision
 or reduce our tax benefits in our consolidated statements of operations. We use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes
 deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;There are various factors that may cause these tax assumptions to change in the near term
 and we may have to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. We cannot predict whether future U.S. federal and state income tax laws and regulations might be passed that could have a material effect on our results of operations. See Note&#160;10

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new accounting standards update (ASU) related to the U.S. Tax Act. The ASU allows for a company to elect to make a one-time reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the change in corporate tax rate as a result of the U.S. Tax Act. The reclassification is the difference between the amount previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the historical U.S. federal tax rate that remains in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the time the U.S. Tax Act was effective and the amount that would have been recorded using the newly enacted rate. Additionally
 the ASU requires a company to disclose whether or not it elects to make the reclassification. This guidance became effective during the first quarter of 2019. We elected to not make the optional one-time reclassification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;In February 2016
 the FASB issued a new ASU that requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under current guidance and to disclose key information about leasing arrangements. The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases. Leases will be classified as finance or operating
 with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the statement of operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;We adopted the new standard prospectively when it became effective in the first quarter of 2019 and applied the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We elected the &#x2018;package of practical expedients&#x2019;
 which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification
 lease classification and initial direct costs. We did not elect the use-of-hindsight or the practical expedient pertaining to land easements; the latter not being applicable to us. We elected all of the new standard&#x2019;s available transition practical expedients that were applicable to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;&gt;The new standard also provides practical expedients for an entity&#x2019;s ongoing accounting. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. This means
 for those leases with a lease term of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;twelve months or less
 we did not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities. We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of our leases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;This standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements. Upon adoption
 the most significant effects related to (1) the recognition of new ROU assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet for our operating leases
 which was $39.6 million and $42.6 million
 respectively
 as of the beginning of fiscal 2019; and (2) providing additional disclosures about our leasing activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;In March 2017
 the FASB issued a new ASU that improves the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit costs. The new guidance revises how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans present the net periodic benefit costs in their income statement and requires that the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs be presented in the same income statement line items as other employee compensation costs from services rendered during the period and present the other components of net periodic pension cost below operating profit. The update was effective beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We adopted this standard retrospectively as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The adoption of this ASU did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position
 results of operations or liquidity
 but did require a reclassification among selling
 general and administrative expenses and other income on our consolidated statements of operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;In May 2014
 the FASB issued guidance on revenue recognition
 with final guidance issued in 2016. The guidance provides for a five-step model to determine the revenue to be recognized from the transfer of goods or services to customers. The guidance also requires improved disclosures to help users of the financial statements better understand the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows relating to customer contracts. It also provides clarification for principal versus agent considerations
 identifying performance obligations and the accounting of intellectual property licenses. In addition
 the FASB introduced practical expedients related to disclosures of remaining performance obligations
 as well as other amendments to guidance on collectability
 non-cash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;We adopted this guidance and related amendments as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018
 applying the full retrospective transition method to all contracts. We concluded that the adoption of this standard primarily affected our policies and estimation methodologies of variable consideration associated with rebates and bill-backs
 product returns and cash discounts. The provisions of the new standard did not impact the timing of revenue recognition but did impact the classification of certain payments to customers
 moving an immaterial amount of such payments from expense to a deduction from net sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;Our sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership
 risks and rewards transfer. Typically
 this occurs when the goods are shipped to the customer. Revenues are recognized in an amount that reflects the net consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods. We report all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction as revenue
 including those amounts related to shipping and handling. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold. Under the new revenue guidance
 we recognize our shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment of our promise to transfer products to our customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;We promote our products with advertising
 consumer incentives and trade promotions. These programs include discounts
 slotting fees
 coupons
 rebates
 in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives. Customer trade promotion and consumer incentive activities are recorded as a reduction to the sale price based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We derive these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;Payment terms in our invoices are based on the billing schedule established in our contracts or purchase orders with customers. We generally recognize the related trade receivable when the goods are shipped. In certain cases
 we require a payment in advance of performance when the customer&#x2019;s credit has not been established. We record these revenues as a contract liability; however
 these amounts have historically been immaterial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;The below tables set forth the adjustments made in fiscal 2018 to net sales

 the FASB issued a new ASU that clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist companies with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The definition of a business may affect many areas of accounting
 including acquisitions
 disposals
 goodwill and consolidation. The ASU is applied on a prospective basis and was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017. We adopted this standard as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018

 the FASB issued a new ASU to provide guidance on eight specific cash flow classification issues and reduce diversity in practice in how some cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified on the statement of cash flows. The ASU was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017. We adopted this standard as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018
 and there was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;In March 2016
 the FASB issued a new ASU that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance requires that excess tax benefits (which represent the excess of actual tax benefits received at the date of vesting or settlement over the benefits recognized over the vesting period or upon issuance of share-based payments) and tax deficiencies (which represent the amount by which actual tax benefits received at the date of vesting or settlement is lower than the benefits recognized over the vesting period or upon issuance of share-based payments) be recorded in the income statement as a reduction of income taxes when the awards vest or are settled. The new guidance also requires excess tax benefits to be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity. As a result of this adoption
 we recognized discrete tax benefits of $0.8 million in the income taxes line item of our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2017 related to excess tax benefits upon vesting or settlement in that period. We elected to adopt the cash flow presentation of the excess tax benefits prospectively
 commencing with our statement of cash flows for the first quarter of 2017
 where we began classifying these benefits
 along with other income tax cash flows
 as an operating activity. We excluded the excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in the computation of our diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;In November 2015
 the FASB issued a new ASU that requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The ASU was effective beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We adopted the provisions of this ASU at the beginning of fiscal 2017 and applied the required changes in accounting principle on a retrospective basis. The update impacted presentation and disclosure only
 and therefore
 the adoption of this ASU did not have any impact on our results of operations or liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;In July 2015
 the FASB issued a new ASU that simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by replacing the current lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost and net realizable value test. We adopted the provisions of this ASU at the beginning of fiscal 2017. The adoption of this ASU did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position

 the FASB issued a new ASU which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. This ASU replaces the incurred loss methodology for recognizing credit losses with a current expected credit losses model and applies to all financial assets
 including trade accounts receivables. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to all periods presented. We intend to adopt the provisions of this ASU in the first quarter of 2020. Currently
 we do not expect the adoption of the new standard to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;In December 2019
 the FASB issued a new ASU which removes certain exceptions for recognizing deferred taxes for investments
 performing intraperiod allocation and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The ASU also adds guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas
 including recognizing deferred taxes for goodwill and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2020. Early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in any interim period. We currently expect to adopt the standard when it becomes effective. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU. Currently
 we do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;In August 2018
 the FASB issued a new ASU which clarifies that implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing arrangements are deferred if they would be capitalized by customers in software licensing arrangements under the internal-use software guidance. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&#160;15
 2019. Early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in any interim period. Currently
 we do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;In August 2018
 the FASB issued a new ASU that aims to improve the overall usefulness of disclosures to financial statement users and reduce unnecessary costs to companies by changing disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other post-retirement plans. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2020. We expect to update our defined benefit pension plan disclosures when the new standard becomes effective. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have an impact to our consolidated financial statements as this ASU only modifies disclosure requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;In August 2018
 the FASB issued a new ASU that aims to improve the overall usefulness of disclosures to financial statement users and reduce unnecessary costs to companies by changing disclosure requirements for fair value measurement. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15

 the FASB issued an amendment to the standards of goodwill impairment testing. The new guidance simplifies the test for goodwill impairment
 by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&#x2019;s fair value; however
 the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally
 an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss
 if applicable. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15

The recognition of compensation expense for the performance share LTIAs is initially based on the probable outcome of the performance condition based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant and the anticipated number of shares to be awarded on a straight-line basis over the applicable performance period. The fair value of the awards on the date of grant is determined based upon the closing price of our common stock on the applicable measurement dates (i.e.
 the deemed grant dates for accounting purposes) reduced by the present value of expected dividends using the risk-free interest-rate as the award holders are not entitled to dividends or dividend equivalents during the vesting period. Our company&#x2019;s performance against the defined performance goals are re-evaluated on a quarterly basis throughout the applicable performance period and the recognition of compensation expense is adjusted for subsequent changes in the estimated or actual outcome. The cumulative effect of a change in the estimated number of shares of common stock to be issued in respect of performance share awards is recognized as an adjustment to earnings in the period of the revision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;The fair value of stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized in expense over the vesting period of the options using the straight-line method. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires various assumptions
 including the expected volatility of our stock
 the expected term of the option
 the risk-free interest rate and the expected dividend yield. Expected volatility is based on both historical and implied volatilities of our common stock over the estimated expected term of the award. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and have a 10-year term. Employee stock options cliff vest three years after the date of grant and non-employee director stock options vest one year after the date of grant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;We recognize compensation expense for only that portion of share-based awards that are expected to vest.

 we are required to estimate our income taxes. This process involves estimating our current tax expenses together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe the recovery is not likely
 we establish a valuation allowance. Further
 to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a financial accounting period
 we include such charge in our tax provision
 or reduce our tax benefits in our consolidated statements of operations. We use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes
 deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;There are various factors that may cause these tax assumptions to change in the near term

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new accounting standards update (ASU) related to the U.S. Tax Act. The ASU allows for a company to elect to make a one-time reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the change in corporate tax rate as a result of the U.S. Tax Act. The reclassification is the difference between the amount previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the historical U.S. federal tax rate that remains in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the time the U.S. Tax Act was effective and the amount that would have been recorded using the newly enacted rate. Additionally
 the ASU requires a company to disclose whether or not it elects to make the reclassification. This guidance became effective during the first quarter of 2019. We elected to not make the optional one-time reclassification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;In February 2016
 the FASB issued a new ASU that requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under current guidance and to disclose key information about leasing arrangements. The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases. Leases will be classified as finance or operating
 with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the statement of operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;We adopted the new standard prospectively when it became effective in the first quarter of 2019 and applied the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We elected the &#x2018;package of practical expedients&#x2019;
 which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification
 lease classification and initial direct costs. We did not elect the use-of-hindsight or the practical expedient pertaining to land easements; the latter not being applicable to us. We elected all of the new standard&#x2019;s available transition practical expedients that were applicable to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;&gt;The new standard also provides practical expedients for an entity&#x2019;s ongoing accounting. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. This means
 for those leases with a lease term of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;twelve months or less
 we did not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities. We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of our leases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;This standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements. Upon adoption
 the most significant effects related to (1) the recognition of new ROU assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet for our operating leases
 which was $39.6 million and $42.6 million
 respectively
 as of the beginning of fiscal 2019; and (2) providing additional disclosures about our leasing activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;In March 2017
 the FASB issued a new ASU that improves the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit costs. The new guidance revises how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans present the net periodic benefit costs in their income statement and requires that the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs be presented in the same income statement line items as other employee compensation costs from services rendered during the period and present the other components of net periodic pension cost below operating profit. The update was effective beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We adopted this standard retrospectively as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The adoption of this ASU did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position
 results of operations or liquidity
 but did require a reclassification among selling
 general and administrative expenses and other income on our consolidated statements of operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;In May 2014
 the FASB issued guidance on revenue recognition
 with final guidance issued in 2016. The guidance provides for a five-step model to determine the revenue to be recognized from the transfer of goods or services to customers. The guidance also requires improved disclosures to help users of the financial statements better understand the nature
 amount
 timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows relating to customer contracts. It also provides clarification for principal versus agent considerations
 identifying performance obligations and the accounting of intellectual property licenses. In addition
 the FASB introduced practical expedients related to disclosures of remaining performance obligations
 as well as other amendments to guidance on collectability
 non-cash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;We adopted this guidance and related amendments as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018
 applying the full retrospective transition method to all contracts. We concluded that the adoption of this standard primarily affected our policies and estimation methodologies of variable consideration associated with rebates and bill-backs
 product returns and cash discounts. The provisions of the new standard did not impact the timing of revenue recognition but did impact the classification of certain payments to customers
 moving an immaterial amount of such payments from expense to a deduction from net sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;Our sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership
 risks and rewards transfer. Typically
 this occurs when the goods are shipped to the customer. Revenues are recognized in an amount that reflects the net consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods. We report all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction as revenue
 including those amounts related to shipping and handling. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold. Under the new revenue guidance
 we recognize our shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment of our promise to transfer products to our customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;We promote our products with advertising
 consumer incentives and trade promotions. These programs include discounts
 slotting fees
 coupons
 rebates
 in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives. Customer trade promotion and consumer incentive activities are recorded as a reduction to the sale price based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We derive these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;Payment terms in our invoices are based on the billing schedule established in our contracts or purchase orders with customers.

 the FASB issued a new ASU that clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist companies with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The definition of a business may affect many areas of accounting
 including acquisitions
 disposals
 goodwill and consolidation. The ASU is applied on a prospective basis and was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017. We adopted this standard as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018
 and there was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements. We applied this ASU while evaluating whether &lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;McCann&#x2019;s&lt;/i&gt;
 acquired on July 16
 2018
 Pirate Brands
 sold on October 17
 2018 and &lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;Clabber Girl&lt;/i&gt;

&#160;2019
 met the definition of a business. See Note 3
 &#x201c;Acquisitions and Divestitures.&#x201d;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;In August 2016
 the FASB issued a new ASU to provide guidance on eight specific cash flow classification issues and reduce diversity in practice in how some cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified on the statement of cash flows. The ASU was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017. We adopted this standard as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018
 and there was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;In March 2016
 the FASB issued a new ASU that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance requires that excess tax benefits (which represent the excess of actual tax benefits received at the date of vesting or settlement over the benefits recognized over the vesting period or upon issuance of share-based payments) and tax deficiencies (which represent the amount by which actual tax benefits received at the date of vesting or settlement is lower than the benefits recognized over the vesting period or upon issuance of share-based payments) be recorded in the income statement as a reduction of income taxes when the awards vest or are settled. The new guidance also requires excess tax benefits to be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity. As a result of this adoption
 we recognized discrete tax benefits of $0.8 million in the income taxes line item of our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2017 related to excess tax benefits upon vesting or settlement in that period. We elected to adopt the cash flow presentation of the excess tax benefits prospectively
 commencing with our statement of cash flows for the first quarter of 2017
 where we began classifying these benefits
 along with other income tax cash flows
 as an operating activity. We excluded the excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in the computation of our diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;In November 2015
 the FASB issued a new ASU that requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The ASU was effective beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We adopted the provisions of this ASU at the beginning of fiscal 2017 and applied the required changes in accounting principle on a retrospective basis. The update impacted presentation and disclosure only
 and therefore
 the adoption of this ASU did not have any impact on our results of operations or liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;In July 2015
 the FASB issued a new ASU that simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by replacing the current lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost and net realizable value test. We adopted the provisions of this ASU at the beginning of fiscal 2017. The adoption of this ASU did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position

 the FASB issued a new ASU which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. This ASU replaces the incurred loss methodology for recognizing credit losses with a current expected credit losses model and applies to all financial assets
 including trade accounts receivables. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to all periods presented. We intend to adopt the provisions of this ASU in the first quarter of 2020. Currently
 we do not expect the adoption of the new standard to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;In December 2019
 the FASB issued a new ASU which removes certain exceptions for recognizing deferred taxes for investments
 performing intraperiod allocation and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The ASU also adds guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas
 including recognizing deferred taxes for goodwill and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2020. Early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in any interim period. We currently expect to adopt the standard when it becomes effective. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU. Currently
 we do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;In August 2018
 the FASB issued a new ASU which clarifies that implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing arrangements are deferred if they would be capitalized by customers in software licensing arrangements under the internal-use software guidance. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&#160;15
 2019. Early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in any interim period. Currently
 we do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;In August 2018
 the FASB issued a new ASU that aims to improve the overall usefulness of disclosures to financial statement users and reduce unnecessary costs to companies by changing disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other post-retirement plans. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2020. We expect to update our defined benefit pension plan disclosures when the new standard becomes effective. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have an impact to our consolidated financial statements as this ASU only modifies disclosure requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;In August 2018
 the FASB issued a new ASU that aims to improve the overall usefulness of disclosures to financial statement users and reduce unnecessary costs to companies by changing disclosure requirements for fair value measurement. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019. We expect to update our fair value measurement disclosures when the new standard becomes effective. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have an impact to our consolidated financial statements as this ASU only modifies disclosure requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;In January 2017
 the FASB issued an amendment to the standards of goodwill impairment testing. The new guidance simplifies the test for goodwill impairment
 by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&#x2019;s fair value; however
 the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally
 an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss
 if applicable. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15

 have included the assets acquired
 liabilities assumed and results of operations in our consolidated financial statements from the respective date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired represents goodwill. Indefinite-lived trademarks are deemed to have an indefinite useful life and are not amortized. Customer relationships and finite-lived trademarks acquired are amortized over 10 to 20 years. Goodwill and other intangible assets
 except in the case of the &lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;Victoria&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;Back to Nature&lt;/i&gt; acquisitions
 are deductible for income tax purposes. Inventory has been recorded at estimated selling price less costs of disposal and a reasonable selling profit and the property
 plant and equipment and other intangible assets (including trademarks
 customer relationships and other intangible assets) acquired have been recorded at fair value as determined by our management with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. See Note 6

 we recorded a purchase price adjustment to increase operating lease right-of-use assets by $1.4 million; trademarks &#x2014; indefinite-lived intangible assets by $1.1 million; and customer relationships &#x2014; finite-lived intangible assets by $1.0 million; and to decrease goodwill by $1.4 million; long-term operating lease liabilities

 we made a mandatory prepayment of $352.2 million principal amount of tranche B term loans with the net proceeds of the Pirate Brands sale. On October 19
 2018
 we made an optional prepayment of the remaining $147.9 million principal amount of tranche B term loans then outstanding under our credit agreement from cash on hand and the proceeds of additional revolving loans under our credit agreement. As a result of the optional and mandatory prepayments of the tranche B term loans
 we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $13.1 million in fiscal 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;On October 10
 2019
 we amended our senior secured credit agreement to
 among other things
 provide for an incremental $450.0 million tranche B term loan facility
 which closed and funded on October 10
 2019. We used the proceeds of the tranche B term loans
 together with the net proceeds of our recently completed offering of $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2027
 to redeem all $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.625% senior notes due 2021
 repay a portion of our borrowings under our revolving credit facility
 pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;The tranche B term loans mature on October 10
 2026 and are subject to amortization at the rate of 1% per year with the balance due and payable on the maturity date. If we prepay all or any portion of the tranche B term loans within six months of the funding of the tranche B term loans in connection with a financing that has a lower interest rate or weighted average yield than the tranche B term loans
 we will owe a repayment fee equal to 1% of the amount prepaid. Otherwise
 we may prepay the term loans at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary &#x201c;breakage&#x201d; costs with respect to the early termination of LIBOR loans). Subject to certain exceptions
 the tranche B term loans are subject to mandatory prepayment upon certain asset dispositions or casualty events and issuances of indebtedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;Interest under the tranche B term loan facility is determined based on alternative rates that we may choose in accordance with our credit agreement
 including a base rate per annum plus an applicable margin of 1.00%
 and LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 2.50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;As of December 28
 2019
 our revolving credit facility under our credit agreement was undrawn and the available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility
 net of outstanding letters of credit of $1.6&#160;million
 was $698.4&#160;million. Proceeds of the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes
 including acquisitions of targets in the same or a similar line of business as our company
 subject to specified criteria. The revolving credit facility matures on November&#160;21
 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;Interest under the revolving credit facility
 including any outstanding letters of credit is determined based on alternative rates that we may choose in accordance with the credit agreement
 including a base rate per annum plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.75%
 and LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%
 in each case depending on our consolidated leverage ratio. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;We are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. The maximum letter of credit capacity under the revolving credit facility is $50.0&#160;million
 with a fronting fee of 0.25% per annum for all outstanding letters of credit and a letter of credit fee equal to the applicable margin for revolving loans that are Eurodollar (LIBOR) loans. The revolving credit facility matures on November 21

Subject to certain exceptions
 the credit agreement provides for mandatory prepayment upon certain asset dispositions or casualty events and issuances of indebtedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;Our obligations under the credit agreement are jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by all of our existing and certain future domestic subsidiaries. The credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries&#x2019; assets except our and our domestic subsidiaries&#x2019; real property. The credit agreement contains customary restrictive covenants
 subject to certain permitted amounts and exceptions
 including covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness
 pay dividends and make other restricted payments
 repurchase shares of our outstanding stock and create certain liens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;The credit agreement also contains certain financial maintenance covenants
 which
 among other things
 specify a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio
 each ratio as defined in the credit agreement. Our consolidated leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of our consolidated net debt
 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to our adjusted EBITDA for such period on a pro forma basis) may not exceed 7.00 to 1.00. We are also required to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75 to 1.00 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. As of December 28
 2019
 we were in compliance with all of the covenants
 including the financial covenants
 in the credit agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;The credit agreement also provides for an incremental term loan and revolving loan facility
 pursuant to which we may request that the lenders under the credit agreement
 and potentially other lenders
 provide unlimited additional amounts of term loans or revolving loans or both on terms substantially consistent with those provided under the credit agreement. Among other things
 the utilization of the incremental facility is conditioned on our ability to meet a maximum senior secured leverage ratio of 4.00 to 1.00
 and a sufficient number of lenders or new lenders agreeing to participate in the facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;&lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;4.625%&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt; Senior Notes due 2021. &lt;/i&gt;On June 4

 as a result of the U.S. Tax Act
 we remeasured our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate
 which resulted in a discrete tax benefit of approximately $133.3&#160;million. In fiscal 2019
 2018 and 2017
 changes in state apportionments
 state filings or state tax laws impacted our deferred blended state rate
 resulting in a deferred state tax expense in fiscal 2019 of $0.8 million































 management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income and reversal of deferred tax liabilities over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible
 a valuation allowance of $1.7 million and $1.0 million was recorded during fiscal 2019 and 2018
 respectively
 to record only the portion of the deferred tax asset that management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences. There was no valuation allowance recorded during fiscal&#160;2017. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable
 however
 could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during future periods are reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;At December 28
 2019 and December 29
 2018
 we had $0.7 million and $0.6 million
 respectively
 of reserves for uncertain tax positions which represents an increase of $0.1 million in fiscal 2019 for additional interest and penalties. Our policy is to classify interest and penalties resulting from income tax uncertainties as income tax expense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;At December 28
 2019 we had intangible assets of $988.5&#160;million for tax purposes
 which are amortizable through 2034.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;We operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions within the United States
 Canada and Mexico and from time to time face audits from various tax authorities regarding the deductibility of certain expenses
 state income tax nexus
 intercompany transactions
 transfer pricing and other matters. Currently
 we are not undergoing any examinations by any tax authorities. We remain subject to examination in all of our tax jurisdictions until the applicable statutes of limitations expire. Fiscal 2015 and subsequent years remain open to examination. As of December 28
 2019

 2017
 President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
 which we refer to as the &#x201c;U.S. Tax Act.&#x201d; The U.S. Tax Act provides for significant changes in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended. The changes in the U.S. Tax Act are broad and complex and we continue to examine the impact the U.S. Tax Act may have on our business and financial results. The U.S. Tax Act contains provisions with separate effective dates but is generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31
 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;Under FASB ASC Topic 740
 Income Taxes
 we are required to revalue any deferred tax assets or liabilities in the period of enactment of change in tax rates. Beginning on January 1
 2018
 the U.S. Tax Act lowered the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% on our U.S. earnings from that date and beyond. The revaluation of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower 21% corporate tax rate reduced our net U.S. deferred income tax liability by approximately $133.3 million and was reflected as an income tax benefit in fiscal 2017. This tax benefit was partially offset by an increase in our blended state rate of approximately $5.8 million and a repatriation expense of $0.9 million in fiscal 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;The reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% was effective for our fiscal 2018 and subsequent years. Our consolidated effective tax rate was approximately 27.7% and 22.4% for fiscal 2019 and fiscal&#160;2018
 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;We also expect to realize a cash tax benefit for future bonus depreciation on certain business additions
 which
 together with the reduced income tax rate

 in fiscal&#160;2019 this limitation resulted in an increase to our taxable income of $30.2 million and we accordingly established a deferred tax asset of $7.4 million without a valuation allowance. Although our interest expense exceeded 30% of our adjusted taxable income in fiscal&#160;2019
 at this time we do not believe this limitation has had
 or will have
 a material adverse impact on our business or financial results because any interest that is non-deductible may be carried forward indefinitely and we believe we have sufficient deferred tax liabilities to offset any deferred tax assets resulting from currently non-deductible interest expense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;The U.S. Treasury issued several regulations supplementing the U.S. Tax Act in 2018
 including detailed guidance clarifying the calculation of the mandatory tax on previously unrepatriated earnings
 application of the existing foreign tax credit rules to newly created categories and expanding details for application of the base erosion tax on affiliate payments. These regulations are to be applied retroactively and did not materially impact our 2018 or 2019 tax rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;The ultimate impact of the U.S. Tax Act on our reported results in fiscal 2020 and beyond may differ from the estimates provided in this report
 possibly materially

 whereby the expected rate of return on each asset class is broken down into the following components: (1)&#160;inflation; (2)&#160;the real risk-free rate of return (i.e.
 the long-term estimate of future returns on default-free U.S. government securities); and (3) the risk premium for each asset class (i.e.
 the expected return in excess of the risk-free rate).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;All three components are based primarily on historical data
 with modest adjustments to take into account additional relevant information that is currently available. For the inflation and risk-free return components
 the most significant additional information is that provided by the market for nominal and inflation-indexed U.S. Treasury securities. That market provides implied forecasts of both the inflation rate and risk-free rate for the period over which currently available securities mature. The historical data on risk premiums for each asset class is adjusted to reflect any systemic changes that have occurred in the relevant markets; e.g.
 the higher current valuations for equities

 Plan No. 001)
 a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan
 sponsored by the Bakery
 Confectionery
 Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union (BCTGM) on behalf of certain employees at our Portland
 Maine facility. The plan provides multiple plan benefits with corresponding contribution rates that are collectively bargained between participating employers and their affiliated BCTGM local unions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;We were notified that for the plan year beginning January 1
 2012
 the plan was in critical status and classified in the Red Zone
 and for the plan year beginning January 1
 2018
 the plan was in critical and declining status. As of the date of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements
 the plan remains in critical and declining status. The law requires that all contributing employers pay to the plan a surcharge to help correct the plan&#x2019;s financial situation. The amount of the surcharge is equal to a percentage of the amount an employer is otherwise required to contribute to the plan under the applicable collective bargaining agreement. During the second quarter of 2015
 we agreed to a collective bargaining agreement that
 among other things
 implements a rehabilitation plan. As a result
 our contributions to the plan are expected to increase by at least 5.0% per year
 assuming consistent hours are worked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:6pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;B&amp;amp;G Foods made contributions to the plan of $0.9 million

 we recognized $7.9 million of operating lease right-of-use assets and $8.3 million of lease liabilities as of the date of acquisition on May 15
 2019. Operating leases are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in the following line items as of December 28

 distribution centers
 warehouse and storage facilities
 machinery and equipment
 and office equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of one year to seven years
 some of which include &lt;span style=-sec-ix-hidden:_b5d29dc3_5d28_4610_ad86_4694038800f5&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to extend the lease term for up to five years

 including the operating lease costs of $11.4 million stated above
 for fiscal 2019. Total rent expense was $13.1 million and $12.4 million for fiscal 2018 and 2017
 respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;Because our operating leases do not provide an implicit rate
 we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We have lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. With the exception of our real estate leases
 we account for our leases as a single lease component. See Note 2
 &#x201c;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#x2014; &lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;Newly Adopted Accounting Standards&lt;/i&gt;
&#x201d; for further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36pt;margin:0pt 0pt 3pt 0pt;&gt;The following table shows the lease term and discount rate for our ROU assets as of December 28

 our board of directors establishes a bonus plan that provides for cash awards to be made to our executive officers and other senior managers upon our company&#x2019;s attainment of pre-set annual financial objectives and individual performance. Awards are normally paid in cash in a lump sum following the close of each plan year. At December 28
 2019
 accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet includes an accrual for the annual bonus of $5.2 million. Threshold performance objectives were not attained for fiscal 2018 and therefore accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet did not include an accrual for the annual bonus plan at December 29
 2018. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;&lt;i style=font-style:italic;&gt;Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan. &lt;/i&gt;Upon the recommendation of our compensation committee
 our board of directors on March&#160;10
 2008 adopted (subject to stockholder approval) the B&amp;amp;G Foods
&#160;Inc. 2008 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan
 which we refer to as the Omnibus Plan. Our stockholders approved the Omnibus Plan at our annual meeting on May&#160;6
 2008. Our stockholders reapproved the material terms of the performance goals in our Omnibus Plan at our annual meeting on May&#160;16
 2013. Upon the recommendation of our compensation committee
 our board of directors in March 2017 approved (subject to stockholder approval) the amendment and restatement of the Omnibus Plan

 our compensation committee has made annual grants of performance share LTIAs to our executive officers and certain other members of senior management under the Omnibus Plan. The performance share LTIAs entitle the participants to earn shares of common stock upon the attainment of certain performance goals over the applicable performance period.

 the applicable performance metric is and has been &#x201c;excess cash&#x201d; (as defined in the award agreements). If our performance fails to meet the performance threshold
 then the awards will not vest and no shares will be issued pursuant to the awards. If our performance meets or exceeds the performance threshold
 then a varying amount of shares from the threshold amount (50% of the target number of shares) up to the maximum amount (200% of the target number of shares) may be earned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;text-indent:36.7pt;margin:0pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;&gt;Subject to the performance goal for the applicable performance period being certified in writing by our compensation committee as having been achieved

 2017
 we acquired Back&#160;to&#160;Nature Foods Company
 LLC and related entities
 brands
 from Brynwood Partners VI L.P.
We have accounted for each of these acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting and
 accordingly
 have included the assets acquired
 liabilities assumed and results of operations in our consolidated financial statements from the respective date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired represents goodwill. Indefinite-lived trademarks are deemed to have an indefinite useful life and are not amortized. Customer relationships and finite-lived trademarks acquired are amortized over 10 to 20 years. Goodwill and other intangible assets
 acquisitions
 are deductible for income tax purposes. Inventory has been recorded at estimated selling price less costs of disposal and a reasonable selling profit and the property
 plant and equipment and other intangible assets (including trademarks
 customer relationships and other intangible assets) acquired have been recorded at fair value as determined by our management with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. See Note 6
acquisition purchase price to the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired at the date of acquisition. The preliminary purchase price allocation may be adjusted as a result of the finalization of our purchase price allocation procedures related to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. During fiscal 2019
 we recorded a purchase price adjustment to increase operating lease right-of-use assets by $1.4 million; trademarks &#8212; indefinite-lived intangible assets by $1.1 million; and customer relationships &#8212; finite-lived intangible assets by $1.0 million; and to decrease goodwill by $1.4 million; long-term operating lease liabilities

 the compensation committee of our board of directors approved a special bonus pool of $6.0&#160;million that was paid in fiscal 2019 to our executive officers and certain members of management to recognize their significant contributions to the successful operation of Pirate Brands during our company&#8217;s five years of ownership of Pirate Brands and to the successful completion of the Pirate Brands sale at a sale price more than double what our company paid for Pirate Brands in 2013.

On October 10
 2019
We made optional prepayments of our tranche B term loans of $150.0 million principal amount in fiscal 2018. On October 18
 2018
 we made a mandatory prepayment of $352.2 million principal amount of tranche B term loans with the net proceeds of the Pirate Brands sale. On October 19
 2018
 we made an optional prepayment of the remaining $147.9 million principal amount of tranche B term loans then outstanding under our credit agreement from cash on hand and the proceeds of additional revolving loans under our credit agreement. As a result of the optional and mandatory prepayments of the tranche B term loans
On October 10
 2019
 we amended our senior secured credit agreement to
 among other things
 provide for an incremental $450.0 million tranche B term loan facility
 which closed and funded on October 10
 2019. We used the proceeds of the tranche B term loans
 together with the net proceeds of our recently completed offering of $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2027
 to redeem all $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.625% senior notes due 2021
 repay a portion of our borrowings under our revolving credit facility
The tranche B term loans mature on October 10
 2026 and are subject to amortization at the rate of 1% per year with the balance due and payable on the maturity date. If we prepay all or any portion of the tranche B term loans within six months of the funding of the tranche B term loans in connection with a financing that has a lower interest rate or weighted average yield than the tranche B term loans
 we will owe a repayment fee equal to 1% of the amount prepaid. Otherwise
 we may prepay the term loans at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary &#8220;breakage&#8221; costs with respect to the early termination of LIBOR loans). Subject to certain exceptions
Interest under the tranche B term loan facility is determined based on alternative rates that we may choose in accordance with our credit agreement
 including a base rate per annum plus an applicable margin of 1.00%
As of December 28
 2019
 our revolving credit facility under our credit agreement was undrawn and the available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility
 net of outstanding letters of credit of $1.6&#160;million
 was $698.4&#160;million. Proceeds of the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes
 including acquisitions of targets in the same or a similar line of business as our company
 subject to specified criteria. The revolving credit facility matures on November&#160;21
Interest under the revolving credit facility
 including any outstanding letters of credit is determined based on alternative rates that we may choose in accordance with the credit agreement
 including a base rate per annum plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.75%
 and LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%
We are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. The maximum letter of credit capacity under the revolving credit facility is $50.0&#160;million
 with a fronting fee of 0.25% per annum for all outstanding letters of credit and a letter of credit fee equal to the applicable margin for revolving loans that are Eurodollar (LIBOR) loans. The revolving credit facility matures on November 21
We may prepay term loans or permanently reduce the revolving credit facility commitment under the credit agreement at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary &#8220;breakage&#8221; costs with respect to the early termination of LIBOR loans). Subject to certain exceptions
Our obligations under the credit agreement are jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by all of our existing and certain future domestic subsidiaries. The credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries&#8217; assets except our and our domestic subsidiaries&#8217; real property. The credit agreement contains customary restrictive covenants
 subject to certain permitted amounts and exceptions
 including covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness
 pay dividends and make other restricted payments
The credit agreement also contains certain financial maintenance covenants
 which
 among other things
 specify a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio
 each ratio as defined in the credit agreement. Our consolidated leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of our consolidated net debt
 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to our adjusted EBITDA for such period on a pro forma basis) may not exceed 7.00 to 1.00. We are also required to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75 to 1.00 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. As of December 28
 2019
 we were in compliance with all of the covenants
 including the financial covenants
The credit agreement also provides for an incremental term loan and revolving loan facility
 pursuant to which we may request that the lenders under the credit agreement
 and potentially other lenders
 provide unlimited additional amounts of term loans or revolving loans or both on terms substantially consistent with those provided under the credit agreement. Among other things
 the utilization of the incremental facility is conditioned on our ability to meet a maximum senior secured leverage ratio of 4.00 to 1.00
On June 4
 2013
 we issued $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2021 at a price to the public of 100% of their face value. Interest on the 4.625% senior notes was payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. On October 10
 2019
On April 3
 2017
 we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2025 at a price to the public of 100% of their face value. On November 20
 2017
 we issued an additional $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2025 at a price to the public 101% of their face value plus accrued interest from October 1
 2017
 which equates to a yield to worst of 5.03%. The notes issued in November 2017 were issued as additional notes under the same indenture as our 5.25% senior notes due 2025 that were issued in April 2017
 and
 as such
We used the net proceeds of the April 2017 offering to repay all of the outstanding borrowings and amounts due under our revolving credit facility and tranche A term loans
 to pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes. We used the net proceeds of the November 2017 offering to repay all of the then outstanding borrowings and amounts due under our revolving credit facility
Interest on the 5.25% senior notes due 2025 is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year
 commencing October 1

 2020 and thereafter at prices declining annually to 100% on or after April 1
 2023
 in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. In addition
 if we undergo a change of control or upon certain asset sales

 capital stock; a number of other restricted payments
 including certain investments; creation of specified liens
 certain sale-leaseback transactions and sales of certain specified assets; fundamental changes

 mergers and transfers of all or substantially all of our assets; and specified transactions with affiliates. Each of the covenants is subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. As of December 28
 2019
On September 26
 2019
We used the proceeds of the offering
 together with the proceeds of incremental term loans made during the fourth quarter of 2019 to redeem all of our outstanding 4.625% senior notes due 2021
 repay a portion of our borrowings under our revolving credit facility
Interest on the 5.25% senior notes due 2027 is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year
 commencing March 15
 2020. The 5.25% senior notes due 2027 will mature on September 15
 2027

 2022 and thereafter at prices declining annually to 100% on or after March 1
 2025
 in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. We may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the 5.25%&#160;senior notes due 2027 prior to March 1
 2022 with the net proceeds from certain equity offerings. We may also redeem some or all of the 5.25% senior notes due 2027 at any time prior to March 1
 2022 at a redemption price equal to the make-whole amount set forth in the tenth supplemental indenture. In addition
 if we undergo a change of control or upon certain asset sales

Annually
 our board of directors establishes a bonus plan that provides for cash awards to be made to our executive officers and other senior managers upon our company&#8217;s attainment of pre-set annual financial objectives and individual performance. Awards are normally paid in cash in a lump sum following the close of each plan year. At December 28
 2019
 accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet includes an accrual for the annual bonus of $5.2 million. Threshold performance objectives were not attained for fiscal 2018 and therefore accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet did not include an accrual for the annual bonus plan at December 29
Upon the recommendation of our compensation committee
 our board of directors on March&#160;10
 2008 adopted (subject to stockholder approval) the B&amp;G Foods
&#160;Inc. 2008 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan
 which we refer to as the Omnibus Plan. Our stockholders approved the Omnibus Plan at our annual meeting on May&#160;6
 2008. Our stockholders reapproved the material terms of the performance goals in our Omnibus Plan at our annual meeting on May&#160;16
 2013. Upon the recommendation of our compensation committee
 our board of directors in March 2017 approved (subject to stockholder approval) the amendment and restatement of the Omnibus Plan
 renamed the Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan. Our stockholders approved the amended and restated Omnibus Plan
 including the materials terms of the performance goals
 at our annual meeting on May 23
The Omnibus Plan authorizes the grant of performance share awards
 restricted stock
 options
 stock appreciation rights
 deferred stock
 stock units and cash-based awards to employees
 non-employee directors and consultants. The total number of shares available for issuance under the Omnibus Plan is 4

 of which 2

680 were available for future issuance as of December 28
Beginning in fiscal 2008
Each performance share LTIA has a threshold
 target and maximum payout. The awards are settled based upon our performance over the applicable performance period. For the performance share LTIAs granted to date
 the applicable performance metric is and has been &#8220;excess cash&#8221; (as defined in the award agreements). If our performance fails to meet the performance threshold
 then the awards will not vest and no shares will be issued pursuant to the awards. If our performance meets or exceeds the performance threshold
