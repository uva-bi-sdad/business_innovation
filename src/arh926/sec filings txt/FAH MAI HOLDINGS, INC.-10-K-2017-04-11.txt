                               PART I
Item 1.  Business
      Fah Mai Holdings
 Inc. (formerly Finch Street Acquisition
Corporation) (Finch or the Company) was incorporated on July 22
2016 under the laws of the State of Delaware to engage in any lawful
corporate undertaking
 including
 but not limited to
 selected mergers
and acquisitions.
	The Company has been formed to provide a method for a foreign
or  domestic private company to become a reporting company with a
class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934.
     The Company registered its common stock on a Form 10
registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Rule 12(g) thereof.  The
Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission periodic
and current reports under Rule 13(a) of the Exchange Act
 including
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports Form 10-K.
     As of December 31
 2016
 the Company had not generated revenues and
had no income or cash flows from operations since inception.  At December
31
 2016
 the Company had sustained net loss of $7
562 and an accumulated
deficit of $7
562.
     The Company's independent auditors have issued a report raising
substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern.  At present
 the Company has no operations and the continuation
of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon financial support
from its stockholders
 its ability to obtain necessary equity financing
to continue operations and/or to successfully locate and negotiate with
a business entity for the combination of that target company with
the Company.
      There is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable.
Subsequent Event
      On February 6
 2017
 the Company changed its name to Fah Mai
Holdings
 Inc. in expectation of the subsequent change in control.
      On February 26
 2017
 subsequent to the date covered by this
Report
 the following events occurred which resulted in
a change of control of the Company:
  1.  The Company cancelled an aggregate of 19
500
000 of the then
      20
000
000 shares of outstanding stock valued at par.
  2.   James M. Cassidy resigned as the Company's president
 secretary
       and director and James McKillop resigned as the Company's vice
       president and director.
  3.   Louis Joseph Haseman was named sole director of the Company and was
       named President
 Secretary and Chief Financial Officer of the Company.
     On February 27
 2017
 the Company issued 40
000
000 shares of its
common stock to its then sole officer and director
 Louis Joseph Haseman.
     Subsequent to the change in control
 the Company has one officer and
director.
	The Company intends to serve as a company to raise funds
for the development of companies to be acquired that have excellent growth
strategies and returns for the investor.  New management of the Company has
experience in marketing
 fund raising and business development.  The
Company hopes to show high returns by undertaking a high risk diverse
portfolio ranging from construction to antiques to collectible whiskey
to sunscreen.
   The Company has an agreement with Tiber Creek Corporation
which assists companies in becoming public companies and assists companies
with introductions to the financial community.  The former president of the
Company is the sole officer and director of Tiber Creek Corporation.
The services provided by Tiber Creek included using the Company as a
vehicle for becoming public.
     There is no agreement nor contractual relationship between the
Company and Tiber Creek to perform or provide services to the other.
However
 as a non-operating blank check company
 the Company was available
for use by a client of Tiber Creek which wished to use a reporting company
incident to the process of registering securities and becoming a
reporting company.
Item 2.  Properties
     The Company has no properties and at this time has no
agreements to acquire any properties.  The Company currently uses
the offices of Management at no cost to the Company.  The Company
expects this arrangement to continue until the Company completes
a change in control.
Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
     There is no litigation pending or threatened by or against the
Company.
Item 4.  Mine Safety Disclosures.
      Not applicable.
                              PART II
Item 5.  Market for Registrant's Common Equity
 Related Stockholder
	 Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
      There is currently no public market for the Company's securities.
     At such time as it qualifies
 the Company may choose to apply for
quotation of its securities on the OTC Bulletin Board.
     The OTC Bulletin Board is a dealer-driven quotation service.
Unlike the Nasdaq Stock Market
 companies cannot directly apply to be
quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board
 only market makers can initiate
quotes
 and quoted companies do not have to meet any quantitative
financial requirements.  Any equity security of a reporting company not
listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market or on a national securities exchange is
eligible.
     As such time as it qualifies
 the Company may choose to apply for
quotation of its securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
     In general there is greatest liquidity for traded securities on
the Nasdaq Capital Market and less on the OTC Bulletin Board.  It is
not possible to predict where
 if at all
 the securities of the Company
will be traded following a business combination.
     Since inception
 the Company has sold securities which
were not registered as follows:

community.
Item 6.  Selected Financial Data.
	There is no selected financial data required to be filed for
a smaller reporting company.
Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
	 and Results of Operations
   The Company has no operations nor does it currently engage in any
business activities generating revenues.  The Company's principal
business objective is to achieve a business combination with a target
company.
     A combination will normally take the form of a merger
 stock-for-stock
exchange or stock-for-assets exchange.  In most instances the target
company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the
definition of  a tax-free reorganization under Section 351 or Section 368
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended.
     No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in
locating or negotiating with any target company.
   In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition
 the
Company may become a party to a merger
 consolidation
 reorganization
joint venture
 licensing agreement or other arrangement with another
corporation or entity.
     As of December 31
 2016
 the Company had not generated revenues
and had no income or cash flows from operations since inception.  At
December 31
 2016
 the Company had sustained net loss of $7
562.
    The Company's independent auditors have issued a report raising
substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern.  At present
 the Company has no operations and the continuation
of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon financial support
from its stockholders
 its ability to obtain necessary equity financing
to continue operations and/or to successfully locate and negotiate with
a business entity for the combination of that target company with
the Company.
     Management will pay all expenses incurred by the Company until a
change in control is effected.  There is no expectation of repayment
for such expenses.
     The president of the Company is also its director.
2016 Year-End Analysis
      The Company has received no income
 has had no operations
nor expenses
 other than Delaware state fees and accounting fees
as required for incorporation and for the preparation of the
Company's financial statements.
Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
     The financial statements for the year ended December 31
 2016
are attached hereto.
Item 9.   Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on
          Accounting and Financial Disclosure
     There were no changes in or disagreements with accountants on
accounting and financial disclosure for the period covered by this
report.
Item 9A.   Controls and Procedures
    Pursuant to Rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to
Exchange Act Rules.  This evaluation  was done as of the end of the fiscal
year under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's
principal executive officer (who is also the principal financial officer).
There has been a change in control in the Company subsequent to the
date of the internal evaluation.  However
 given that the Company
has only one officer and director there does not
appear to be any significant changes in internal controls or in other
factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to
the date of the evaluation.  Based upon that evaluation
 the principal
executive officer believes that the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in gathering
 analyzing and disclosing information
needed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the
Company in its periodic reports is recorded
 summarized and processed
timely.  The principal executive officer is directly involved in the
day-to-day operations of the Company.
Management's Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
     The Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
the Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's
officer
 its president
 conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31
 2016
 based on the criteria establish in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this evaluation
management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial
reporting was not effective as of December 31
 2016
 based on those
criteria. A control system can provide only reasonably
 not absolute
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues have been detected.
    KCCW Accountancy Corp.
 the independent registered public accounting
firm of the Company
 has not issued an attestation report on the
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
      There were no changes in the Company's internal controls over
financial reporting  during its fourth fiscal quarter that materially
affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 its internal
control over financial reporting.  Subsequent to the period covered
by this Report and the fourth fiscal quarter
 the Company effected a
change in control.  New management consists of one officer and
director who is also a shareholder.  Such person maintains
complete financial reporting control as the primary officer.  Such
control by the primary officer is the same as was in effect prior
to the change in control.
Item 9B.  Other information
      Not applicable.

     The Directors and Officers of the Company subsequent to the
period covered by this Report are as follows:
      Name                	Positions and Offices Held
     -----------------          ----------------------
    Louis Joseph Haseman	President
 Secretary
 Director
                                    Chief Financial Officer
Management of The Company
     The Company has no employees.  Mr. Haseman is the only officer
and director of the Company.
     There are no agreements or understandings for the officer or
director to resign at the request of another person and the above-
named officer and director is not acting on behalf of nor will act
at the direction of any other person.
     Set forth below are the names of the directors and officers of
the Company
 all positions and offices with the Company held
 the
period during which they have served as such
 and the business
experience during at least the last five years:
Louis Joseph Haseman
    Louis Joseph Haseman serves as President
 Secretary
 Chief Financial
Officer and sole director of the Company.  From 2010 to the present
Mr. Haseman has been the director and owner of HGT Co.
 Ltd. with two
operating brands: Exotic Golf Holidays which specializes in golf holidays
located around the Indian Ocean and Quality Health Travel which specializes
in medical tourism including plastic surgery
 hip replacements and stem cell
treatment.  From 2011 to the present
 Mr. Haseman has served as the owner of
Sunscreen Island Co.
 Ltd. which is the exclusive importer and distributor
of the Island Tribe sunscreen brand in Thailand and the Philippines.  Since
2012 to the present
 Mr. Haseman has also been part owner of Epikurean
Resorts
 a luxury hotel and resorts management and development
company.  From 2015-2016
 Mr. Haseman was the owner of Euro Facade Tech
Thailand Co.
 Ltd.
 a global containment wall and design company.
Recent Blank Check Companies
     James Cassidy
 the former president and a director of the Company
and James McKillop
 former vice president and a director of the Company
are involved with other existing blank check companies
 and in creating
additional similar companies.  The initial business purpose of each
of these companies was or is to engage in a business combination with
an unidentified company or companies and each were or will be classified
as a blank check company until completion of a business combination.
Conflicts of Interest
     There are no binding guidelines or procedures for resolving
potential conflicts of interest. Failure by management to resolve
conflicts of interest in favor of the Company could result in
liability of management to the Company.  However
 any attempt by
shareholders to enforce a liability of management to the Company
would most likely be prohibitively expensive and time consuming.
     Code of Ethics.  The Company has not at this time adopted a
Code of Ethics pursuant to rules described in Regulation S-K.  The
Company has no operations or business and does not receive any revenues.
The adoption of an Ethical Code at this time would not serve the
primary purpose of such a code to provide a manner of conduct as
the development
 execution and enforcement of such a code would be
by the same persons and only persons to whom such code applied.
Furthermore
 because the Company does not have any activities
 there
are activities or transactions which would be subject to this code.
If the Company enters into a business combination management will
propose adoption of a Code of Ethics.
     Corporate Governance.  For reasons similar to those described
above
 the Company does not have a nominating nor audit committee of the
board of directors.  At this time
 the Company has only one officer
and one director.  The Company receives no revenues.  At such time
that the Company enters into a business combination and/or has
additional shareholders and a larger board of directors and commences
activities
 the Company will propose creating committees of its board
of directors
 including both a nominating and an audit committee.
Management of the Company intends to review and implement
 as necessary
procedures for shareholder nomination of members to the Company's board
of directors.
Item 11.  Executive Compensation
     The Company's officers and directors do not receive any
compensation for services rendered to the Company
 nor have they
received such compensation in the past.  The officers and directors
are not accruing any compensation pursuant to any agreement with the
Company.
     No retirement
 pension
 profit sharing
 stock option or
insurance programs or other similar programs have been adopted by
the Company for the benefit of its employees.
     The Company does not have a compensation committee for
the same reasons as described above.
Item 12.  Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and
          Management and Related Stockholder Matters
     The following table sets forth
 as of December 31
 2016
 each
person known by the Company to be the beneficial owner of five

power with respect to the shares shown.

Item 13.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and
	  Director Independence
   The Company has issued a total of 19
263
367 shares of common
stock pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act .
    As the organizers and developers of the Company
 James M. Cassidy
and James McKillop may be considered promoters.  Mr. Cassidy provided
services to the Company without charge consisting of preparing and filing
the charter corporate documents and preparing this registration statement.
   The Company is not currently required to maintain an independent
director as defined by Rule 4200 of the Nasdaq Capital Market nor does
it anticipate that it will be applying for listing of its securities on
an exchange in which an independent directorship is required. It is unlikely
that the current director would be considered an independent director if
it were to do so.
Item 14.  Principal Accounting Fees and Services.
	The Company has no activities
 no income and no expenses
except for independent audit and Delaware state fees.  The Company's
president has donated his time in preparation and filing of all
state and federal required taxes and reports.
Audit Fees
        The aggregate fees incurred in 2016 for professional services
rendered by the independent registered public accounting firm for the
audits of the Company's annual financial statements and review of
financial statements included in the Company's Form 10-K and Form
10-Q reports and services normally provided in connection with
statutory and regulatory filings or engagements were as follows:

	The Company does not currently have an audit committee serving
and as a result its board of directors performs the duties of an audit
committee.  The board of directors will evaluate and approve in advance
the scope and cost of the engagement of an auditor before the auditor
renders audit and non-audit services.  The Company does not rely on pre-
approval policies and procedures.

       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors
Fah Mai Holdings
 Inc.
(formerly Finch Street Acquisition Corporation)
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Fah Mai Holdings
Inc. (the Company) as of December 31
 2016
 and the related statements
of operations
 changes in stockholders' deficit and cash flows for the Period
from July 22
 2016 (Inception) to December 31
 2016.  These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company was not
required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. Our audit includes
examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. Our audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion
 the financial statements referred to above present fairly
in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of
December 31
 2016 and the results of its operations and its cash flows
from July 22
 2016 (Inception) to December 31
 2016 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the
financial statements
 the Company has had no revenues and income since
inception. These conditions
 among others
 raise substantial doubt about
the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans
concerning these matters are also described in Note 2
 which includes the
raising of additional equity financing or merger with another entity. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTE 1   NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
NATURE OF OPERATIONS
Fah Mai Holdings
 Inc. (formerly Finch Street Acquisition Corporation)
(Fah Mai or the Company) was incorporated on July 22
 2016 under the
laws of the state of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking
including
 but not limited to
 selected mergers and acquisitions. The
Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and its
operations to date have been limited to issuing shares to its original
shareholders. The Company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a
business entity for the combination of that target company with the Company.
The combination will normally take the form of a merger
 stock-for-stock
exchange or stock-for-assets exchange. In most instances the target company
will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition
of a tax-free reorganization under Section 351 or Section 368 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended. No assurances can be given that
the Company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target
company. The Company has been formed to provide a method for a foreign or
domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class of
securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
In February
 2017
 in anticipation of the subsequent change in control
 the
Company filed a Form 8-K announcing the change in its name to Fah Mai
Holdings
 Inc.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed
to assist in understanding the Company's financial statements. Such financial
statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the Company's
management
 who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These
accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America (GAAP) in all material respects
 and have
been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying financial statements.
The Company has not earned any revenue from operations since inception.
Accordingly
 the Company's activities have been accounted for as those of
a Development Stage Enterprise as set forth in ASC 915
 Development
Stage Entities. Among the disclosures required by ASC 915
 are that the
Company's financial statements be identified as those of a development stage
company
 and that the statements of operations
 stockholders' equity and cash
flows disclose activity since the date of the Company's inception.  The Company
chose December 31 as its fiscal year end.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results could
differ from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking
institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments with original
maturities of 90 days or less. The Company did not have cash equivalents as
of December 31
 2016.
CONCENTRATION OF RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places its cash with
high quality banking institutions. The Company did not have cash balances
in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit as of December 31
2016.

                     FAH MAI HOLDINGS

                    Notes to Financial Statements
INCOME TAXES
Under ASC 740
 Income Taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when it is
more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized.  As of December 31
 2016 there were no deferred taxes due to the
uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior
to expiration.
LOSS PER COMMON SHARE
Basic loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing
net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted loss per common share reflect the potential
dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common
stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the
issuance of common stock that then shared in the loss of the entity.  As
of December 31
 2016
 there are no outstanding dilutive securities.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of
financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements
of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
financial statements on a recurring basis. Additionally
 the Company adopted
guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are
recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a
nonrecurring basis. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that
prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the
lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs
(Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as
follows:
  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the
measurement date.
  Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1
that are observable for the asset or liability
 either directly or indirectly.
  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their fair
values because of the short maturity of these instruments.
NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN
The Company has not yet generated any revenue since inception to date and
has sustained operating losses of $7
562 during the period ended December 31
2016. The Company had a working capital deficit of $5
250 and an accumulated
deficit of $7
562 as of December 31
 2016.  The Company's continuation as a
going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows
from operations to meet its obligations and/or obtaining additional financing
from its members or other sources
 as may be required.

                    Notes to Financial Statements
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern; however
 the above condition
raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to do so. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future
effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and
classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern.
In order to maintain its current level of operations
 the Company will require
additional working capital from either cash flow from operations or from the
sale of its equity.  However
 the Company currently has no commitments
from any third parties for the purchase of its equity. If the Company is unable
to acquire additional working capital
 it will be required to significantly
reduce its current level of operations.
NOTE 3 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In November 2016
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-18
Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (ASU 2016-18).
The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice by adding or
clarifying guidance on classification and presentation of changes in
restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective
for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017. Early
adoption is permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied
retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-18
 which will only impact
the Company if it has restricted cash in the future.
In August 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-15
 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic
230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (ASU 2016-
15). ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and
cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.
ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017.
The new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it
is impracticable to apply
 in which case it would be required to apply the
amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company
is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on its
condensed financial statements.
In August 2014
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15
 Presentation of Financial
Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties
about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. This standard is
intended to define management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is
substantial doubt about an organization's ability to continue as a going
concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. Under U.S. GAAP
financial statements are prepared under the presumption that the reporting
organization will continue to operate as a going concern
 except in limited
circumstances. Financial reporting under this presumption is commonly
referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern
basis of accounting is critical to financial reporting because it
establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying assets and
liabilities. Currently
 U.S. GAAP lacks guidance about management's
responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the
organization's ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related
footnote disclosures. This ASU provides guidance to an organization's
management
 with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce
diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly
provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes.
The amendments are effective for annual periods ending after December 15
2016
 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15
2016. Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods
for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard.
Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its
Emerging Issues Task Force) and the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material
impact on the Company's present or future financial statements.
