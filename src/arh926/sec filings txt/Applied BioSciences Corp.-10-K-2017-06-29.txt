 Stony Hill is the owner and has right to intellectual property

 no step-up in basis or intangible assets or goodwill was recorded in this transaction. In connection with the Share Exchange Agreement
 the Company paid $325
000 to the former shareholders of Stony Hill which has been recorded as an expense of the reverse merger in the statement of operations for the period ended&nbsp;March 31
 2017&nbsp;included elsewhere in the Form 10-K

584 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock were cancelled

 our now principal business and historical financial statements of our company
 began operations on March 16
 2016. From the period inception (March 16
 2016) to March 31
 2016
 the only activity we incurred was $8
176 of general and administrative expenses. Thus
 the following discussion primarily relates to our fiscal year ended March 31
 2017. 

Fiscal Year Ended March 31
 2017 

: Our revenues are obtained from two main sources - license fees and sale of product. For license fees
 revenue arrangements provide for the payment of contractually determined monthly ongoing fees in consideration for the grant of right to use our intellectual property
 including trademark
 trade dress
 images
 likenesses and other associated intellectual property
 such as the name &#8220;Stony Hill&#8221; related to Damian Marley and in some cases mutually agreed upon marketing and special appearances by certain members of our Company. Revenue from products relate to shipments of cannabidiol (&#8220;CBD&#8221;) brand products
 which we acquired in late February from mCig
 Inc. During our fiscal year ended March 31
 2017
 we incurred revenue of $45
554
 which comprised $27
500 from a license agreement and $18
054 from sales of products. 

: Cost of goods sold consists of purchases of inventory for sale. We generally purchase products that are private labels and brand the products using our tradenames. During the fiscal year ended March 31
 2017
 we incurred $6
391 of costs related to product purchases representing 36% of product revenues. We do not incur costs related to the license of our intellectual property.

: Gross margin was $39
163 or 85% of revenue. Gross margin comprised $27
500 from sale of services and $11
663 or 64% gross margin from sale of product.

: General and administrative expenses were $158
761 for the fiscal year ended March 31
 2017 compared to $8
176 for the period from our inception (March 16
 2016) to March 31
 2016. General and administrative expenses mainly comprised of professional fees
 travel expenses
 meals and entertainment and other office support costs. 

: Amortization relates to the amortization of a brand that we acquired in February 2017
 which is being amortized over a period of 5 years. Amortization totaled $19
956 for the fiscal year ended March 31
 2017 and will total $227
627 per year.

: In conjunction with the Share Exchange Agreement
 Stony Hill Ventures paid us $325
000 and we assumed $51
366 of liabilities
 which was recorded as a cost of the reverse merger. 


















 2017 is as follows:


835 for the fiscal year ended March 31
 2017
 which primarily comprised of general and administrative expenses.


000
 which comprised of $300
000 of equity investments we made during the fiscal year ended March 31
 2017
 $325
000 reverse merger cost paid in cash
 and $150
000 related to the acquisition of a product line from mCig Inc. 


 2017 was $1
125
101
 which mainly comprised of the sale of 937
500 shares of our common stock to accredited investors in a private placement.




 primarily through the sale of equity securities
 as we have only recently begun to receive revenues from our principal business activities. Our uses of cash have been primarily for operations and marketing efforts to promote our intellectual property and company. We anticipate that significant additional expenditures will be necessary to expand and bring to market our license and marketing services before sufficient and consistent positive operating cash flows will be achieved. Additional funds will be needed to continue operations
 obtain profitability and to achieve our objectives. As such
 our cash resources are insufficient to meet our current operating expense requirements and planned business objectives beyond the date of this Form 10-K filing without additional financing.


 as of March 31
 2017 we had cash on hand and had an accumulated deficit of $212
637 and $524
096
 respectively
 and during our fiscal year ended March 31
 2017
 utilized cash for operations and incurred a net loss of $137
464 and $515
920

 our independent auditors in their audit report for our fiscal year ended March 31
 2017 expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

 we raised $1

 we will need and are currently working on obtaining additional funds to operate our business through and beyond the date of this Form 10-K filing. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing
 such financing could contain undue restrictions and covenants on our operations
 in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders in the case of convertible debt and equity financing.


















 estimates include the collectability of accounts receivable
 recoverability of inventory
 assumptions made in determining impairment of investments and intangible
 useful life of our intangible
 and accruals for potential liabilities. These estimates generally involve complex issues and require judgments

 and are subject to change from period to period. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates.&nbsp;




 we use either the equity method or the cost method of accounting. We use the equity method for unconsolidated equity investments in which we are considered to have significant influence over the operations of the investee. We uses the cost method for all other investments. Under the cost method
 there is no change to the cost basis unless there is an other-than-temporary decline in value or dividends are received. &nbsp;If the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary
 we write down the cost basis of the investment to a new cost basis that represents realizable value. 




 we assess the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments
 if any
 are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which the impairment determination was made.

 Inc. or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 21
 2014 and established a fiscal year end of March 31. Effective October 24
 2016 the Company changed its name from First Fixtures Inc. to Stony Hill Corp. The Company is organized for various investments to be made under the Stony Hill brand as well as to conduct any other related business and activities. The Company is the owner and has right to intellectual property
 including trademark
 trade dress
 images
 likenesses and other associated intellectual property such as the name Stony Hill
 related to Damian Marley. 




 2016
 the Company
 entered into a Share Exchange Agreement by and among the Company
 Stony Hill Ventures Corp. (&#8220;Stony Hill Ventures&#8221;)
 and the holders of common stock of Stony Hill Ventures
 which consisted of 26 stockholders. Stony Hill Ventures was incorporated on March 15
 2016
 in Nevada and was organized for various investments under the Stony Hill brand as well as to conduct any other related business and activities. 


 the Company offered
 sold and issued 10
830
000 shares of common stock of the Company in consideration for all the issued and outstanding shares in Stony Hill Ventures. The effect of the issuance is that the former Stony Hill Ventures stockholders obtained approximately 73% of the then issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company
 and Stony Hill Ventures became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and now represents the Company&#8217;s principal business.


 Damian Marley became the Company&#8217;s President and Chief Executive Officer and sole member of the Board of Directors
 and is the holder of 3
150
000 shares
 or 21.2%
 of the outstanding common stock of the Company. Dan Dalton became the Company&#8217;s Treasurer and is the holder of 2
250
000 shares
 or 15.1%
 of the outstanding common stock of the Company. John Brady became the Company&#8217;s new Secretary and is holder of 2
000
000 shares
 or 13.4%
 of the outstanding common stock of the Company. The Company&#8217;s new officers and sole director
 therefore
 controlled an aggregate of 7
400
000
 or 49.8%
 of the outstanding common stock of the Company after the transaction.


 Stony Hill Ventures&#8217; assets
 liabilities and results of operations became the historical financial statements of the Company. No step-up in basis or intangible assets or goodwill was recorded in this transaction. In connection with the Share Exchange Agreement
 the Company paid $325
000 to the former shareholders of Stony Hill and assumed $1
842 of accounts payable and $49
524 of an amount owed to the former CEO of the Company
 which has been recorded as an expense of the reverse merger in the accompanying statement of operations for the period ended December 31
2016. Prior to the Share Exchange
 6
002
584 shares of the Company&#8217;s then outstanding common stock were cancelled
 and the remaining 4
001
757 shares of common stock were considered to be shares issued upon the reverse merger.


 2016
 the Company declared a 1 for 10 stock split.&nbsp;All share and per share amounts have been retro actively restated as if the split had occurred as of the earliest period presented















FOR THE PERIOD FROM MARCH 16
 2016 (INCEPTION) TO MARCH 31
 2016
 AND 
FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31
 2017




 the Company has only recently started to generate revenues from its business operations and as of March 31
 2017
 and has incurred a net loss of $515
920 and used $150
835 of cash from operating activities during the fiscal year ended March 31
 2017. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.


 2017
 the Company raised $1
125
000 through the sale of 937
500 aggregate shares of its common stock to accredited investors. However
 the Company will need and is currently working on obtaining additional funds to operate its business through and beyond the date of this Form 10-K filing. There is no assurance that such funds will be available or at terms acceptable to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing
 it may contain undue restrictions and covenants on its operations
 in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders in the case of convertible debt and equity financing.

 the Company uses either the equity method or the cost method of accounting. The Company uses the equity method for unconsolidated equity investments in which the Company is considered to have significant influence over the operations of the investee. The Company uses the cost method for all other investments. Under the cost method
 there is no change to the cost basis unless there is an other-than-temporary decline in value or dividends are received. If the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary
 the Company writes down the cost basis of the investment to a new cost basis that represents realizable value. Distributions received from the income of an investee on cost method investments are included in Equity method investments (loss)/income, net. Investments accounted for under the equity method or cost method of accounting above are included in the caption Equity investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 31
 2017
 management estimates that the cost basis approximates the fair market value.




 the Company assesses the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments
 if any
 are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which the impairment determination was made.




 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. Under ASU 2014-09
 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition
 the standard requires disclosure of the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The FASB has recently issued ASU 2016-08
 ASU 2016-10
 ASU 2016-11
 ASU 2016-12
 ASU 2016-20
 and ASU 2017-05
 all of which clarify certain implementation guidance within ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods therein. The standard can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method)
 or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). The Company is currently in the process of analyzing the information necessary to determine the impact of adopting this new guidance on its financial position
 results of operations
 and cash flows. The Company will adopt the provisions of this statement in the quarter beginning April 1
 2018. 


 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases. This update will require the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability
 initially measured at the present value of the lease payments
 for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. For operating leases
 the asset and liability will be expensed over the lease term on a straight-line basis
 with all cash flows included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. For finance leases
 interest on the lease liability will be recognized separately from the amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statement of comprehensive income and the repayment of the principal portion of the lease liability will be classified as a financing activity while the interest component will be included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption
 leases will be recognized and measured at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its financial statements and related disclosures.


 the FASB issued ASU 2017-01
 Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. The new guidance clarifies the definition of a business and provides further guidance for evaluating whether a transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of an asset or a business. The new standard will become effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. However
 early adoption is permitted and as such
 the Company adopted this pronouncement in January 2017. Adoption did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.


 the FASB issued ASU 2016-01
 Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. ASU 2016-01 requires that most equity investments be measured at fair value
 with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net income. The pronouncement also impacts financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU 2016-01.

 2017
 we carried out an evaluation
 under the supervision and with the participation of members of our management
 including our President (who is our principal executive officer) and our Secretary (who is our principal financial officer)
 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act. Our President and our Secretary have concluded
 based on their evaluation
 that as of March 31
 2017
 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized
 and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including the President and Secretary
 as appropriate
 to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.




 including policies and procedures
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of this assessment
 our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of March 31
 2017 based on such criteria. Deficiencies existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (i) lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board
 resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and (ii) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. Management believes that the lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures
 which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.


 no matter how well conceived and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance that the objectives of the control system are met under all potential conditions
 regardless of how remote
 and may not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
 within the Company have been prevented or detected. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.








 we continue to review
 test
 and improve the effectiveness of our internal controls. There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter and since the year ended March 31
 2017 that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.


















ITEM 10. DIRECTORS
 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE


 2017 are as follows:























































Damian Marley
 age 38



 2016. Mr. Marley is a Jamaican reggae artist and the youngest son of reggae legend Bob Marley. Mr. Marley garnered his own place in music history when he became the first ever reggae artist to win a Grammy outside of the &#8220;Reggae&#8221; category. Mr. Marley&#8217;s background as a musician led to our conclusion that he should serve as a director in light of our business and structure.

Chris Bridges
 age 



 2017
 and as a director since March 9
 2017. Chris Bridges
 age 38
 has served as the Chief Executive Officer of Vessix Inx
 a virtual payment systems business which provides payment services designed for the aviation industry
 since January 2013. From January 2009 until September 2013
 Mr. Bridges served as a director of Banctek Solutions
 which provides merchant bankcard processing services to all types of merchants. From January 2005 until January 2008
 Mr. Bridges was Executive Vice President - Acquisitions at PRS Assets
 of Denver
 Colorado. 

John Brady
 age 51



 2016. Mr. Brady spent the first part of his career as a broker and owner of a boutique investment banking brokerage firm. For the past 12 years
 he been an independent consultant
 advising on strategic business planning. Mr. Brady attended Brooklyn College from 1983 to 1987.

Dan Dalton
 age 



 2016. Dan Dalton
 age 46
 has spent the last 20 years in the music industry
 guiding and managing the career of artists. Based in Los Angeles
 he currently manages the careers of Damian &#8220;Jr. Gong&#8221; Marley
 son of reggae legend Bob Marley
 and celtic-punk band Flogging Molly. In addition to managing artists
 he manages a business that charters cruise ships and produces music festivals. Recently
 Dalton has partnered his business with Roc Nation
 a full-service entertainment company founded by artist Jay Z.








 none of whom qualify as an independent director in accordance with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market. The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests
 such as that the director is not
 and has not been for at least three years
 one of our employees and that neither the director
 nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. In addition
 our board of directors has not made a subjective determination as to each director that no relationships exist which
 in the opinion of our board of directors
 would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director
 though such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our board of directors made these determinations
 our board of directors would have reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and us with regard to each director&#8217;s business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management.















 nominee for director
 or executive officer of the Company has appeared as a party in any legal proceeding material to an evaluation of his ability or integrity during the past ten years.




 2017
 the Company had no significant employees who were not officers or directors of the Company.




 the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our directors. The Board of Directors has not established an audit committee and does not have an audit committee financial expert
 nor has the Board of Directors established a nominating committee. The Board is of the opinion that such committees are not necessary since the Company is an early business development stage company and has only two directors
 and to date
 such directors have been performing the functions of such committees. Thus
 there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation
 nominations
 and audit issues that may affect management decisions.


 we are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executive officers or directors. 




 and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities
 file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Executive officers
 directors and greater-than-ten percent stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based on our review of filings made on the SEC website
 and the fact of us not receiving certain forms or written representations from certain reporting persons that they have complied with the relevant filing requirements
 we believe that
 during the year ended March 31
 2017
 none of our executive officers
 directors and greater-than-ten percent stockholders complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements.




 every effort has been made to ensure that the views of stockholders are heard by the Board of Directors or individual directors
 as applicable
 and that appropriate responses are provided to stockholders in a timely manner. We believe that we are responsive to stockholder communications
 and therefore have not considered it necessary to adopt a formal process for stockholder communications with our Board. During the upcoming year
 our Board will continue to monitor whether it would be appropriate to adopt such a process.

 the Company uses either the equity method or the cost method of accounting. The Company uses&#13;the equity method for unconsolidated equity investments in which the Company is considered to have significant influence over&#13;the operations of the investee. The Company uses the cost method for all other investments. Under the cost method
 there is no&#13;change to the cost basis unless there is an other-than-temporary decline in value or dividends are received. If the decline is&#13;determined to be other-than-temporary
 the Company writes down the cost basis of the investment to a new cost basis that represents&#13;realizable value. Distributions received from the income of an investee on cost method investments are included in &amp;#34;Equity&#13;method investments (loss)/income
 net.&amp;#34; Investments accounted for under the equity method or cost method of accounting above&#13;are included in the caption &amp;#34;Equity investments&amp;#34; on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 31
 2017

&#13;the Company assesses the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows&#13;associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts&#13;with Customers. ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition&#13;guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. Under ASU&#13;2014-09
 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that&#13;reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition
 the standard&#13;requires disclosure of the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.&#13;The FASB has recently issued ASU 2016-08
 ASU 2016-10
 ASU 2016-11
 ASU 2016-12
 ASU 2016-20
 and ASU 2017-05
 all of which clarify&#13;certain implementation guidance within ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December&#13;15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods&#13;therein. The standard can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method)
&#13;or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application&#13;(the cumulative catch-up transition method). The Company is currently in the process of analyzing the information necessary to&#13;determine the impact of adopting this new guidance on its financial position
 results of operations
 and cash flows. The Company&#13;will adopt the provisions of this statement in the quarter beginning April 1

 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases. This update will require the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a&#13;corresponding lease liability
 initially measured at the present value of the lease payments
 for all leases with terms longer&#13;than 12 months. For operating leases
 the asset and liability will be expensed over the lease term on a straight-line basis
 with&#13;all cash flows included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. For finance leases
 interest on the lease liability&#13;will be recognized separately from the amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statement of comprehensive income and the&#13;repayment of the principal portion of the lease liability will be classified as a financing activity while the interest component&#13;will be included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting&#13;periods beginning after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption

 the FASB issued ASU 2017-01
 &amp;#34;Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business.&amp;#34;&#13;The new guidance clarifies the definition of a business and provides further guidance for evaluating whether a transaction will&#13;be accounted for as an acquisition of an asset or a business. The new standard will become effective beginning in the first quarter&#13;of fiscal 2019. However
 early adoption is permitted and as such

 the FASB issued ASU 2016-01
 Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial&#13;Assets and Financial Liabilities. ASU 2016-01 requires that most equity investments be measured at fair value
 with subsequent&#13;changes in fair value recognized in net income. The pronouncement also impacts financial liabilities under the fair value option&#13;and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual reporting periods&#13;beginning after December 15

 Business Combinations and ASU 2017-01
 Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying&#13;the Definition of a Business
 in accounting for the Asset Purchase Agreement. Under this guidance
 the Company accounted for the&#13;transaction as an asset purchase. As such
 the Company recorded an intangible asset of $1
138
135 consisting of the VitaCBD brand&#13;and $5
865 of inventory received from mCig. The intangible is being amortized over a period of 5 years
 the estimated life of&#13;the brand acquired. Amortization totaled $19
956 for the fiscal year ended March 31
 2017 and will total $227

 if the average common stock market price of the Company&amp;#146;s common stock held&#13;by mCig falls below $1.57 per share
 or $550
000 total value (&amp;#147;Market Value&amp;#148;)
 during any 7-day period during the&#13;first year following the Second Stock Issuance (May 24
 2017)
 then the Company is obligated to issue to mCig additional shares&#13;of the Company&amp;#146;s common stock to increase the then Market Value held by mCig to $550
000. As of March 31
 2017



 the Company entered in a License Agreement OGE Management

 2017
 the Company&#13;had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $524
000 that may be available to reduce future years' taxable income through&#13;2037. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements
&#13;as management has determined that their realization of the Company&amp;#146;s net deferred tax assets of approximately $178
000 was&#13;not likely to occur and accordingly










 the Company may recognize the tax benefit from&#13;an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing&#13;authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such&#13;a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate&#13;settlement. These accounting rules also provide guidance on de-recognition
 classification
 interest and penalties on income taxes
&#13;accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. As of March 31
 2017

 the Company uses either the equity method or the cost method of accounting. The Company uses&#13;the equity method for unconsolidated equity investments in which the Company is considered to have significant influence over the&#13;operations of the investee. The Company uses the cost method for all other investments. Under the cost method
 there is no change&#13;to the cost basis unless there is an other-than-temporary decline in value or dividends are received. If the decline is determined&#13;to be other-than-temporary
 the Company writes down the cost basis of the investment to a new cost basis that represents realizable&#13;value. Distributions received from the income of an investee on cost method investments are included in &amp;#34;Equity method investments&#13;(loss)/income
 net.&amp;#34; Investments accounted for under the equity method or cost method of accounting above are included in&#13;the caption &amp;#34;Equity investments&amp;#34; on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 31

&#13;the Company assesses the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows&#13;associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts&#13;with Customers. ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition&#13;guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. Under ASU&#13;2014-09
 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that&#13;reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition
 the standard&#13;requires disclosure of the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.&#13;The FASB has recently issued ASU 2016-08
 ASU 2016-10
 ASU 2016-11
 ASU 2016-12
 ASU 2016-20
 and ASU 2017-05
 all of which clarify&#13;certain implementation guidance within ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December&#13;15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods&#13;therein. The standard can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method)
&#13;or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application&#13;(the cumulative catch-up transition method). The Company is currently in the process of analyzing the information necessary to&#13;determine the impact of adopting this new guidance on its financial position
 results of operations
 and cash flows. The Company&#13;will adopt the provisions of this statement in the quarter beginning April 1

 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases. This update will require the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a&#13;corresponding lease liability
 initially measured at the present value of the lease payments
 for all leases with terms longer&#13;than 12 months. For operating leases
 the asset and liability will be expensed over the lease term on a straight-line basis
 with&#13;all cash flows included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. For finance leases
 interest on the lease liability&#13;will be recognized separately from the amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statement of comprehensive income and the&#13;repayment of the principal portion of the lease liability will be classified as a financing activity while the interest component&#13;will be included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting&#13;periods beginning after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption

 the FASB issued ASU 2017-01
 &amp;#34;Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business.&amp;#34;&#13;The new guidance clarifies the definition of a business and provides further guidance for evaluating whether a transaction will&#13;be accounted for as an acquisition of an asset or a business. The new standard will become effective beginning in the first quarter&#13;of fiscal 2019. However
 early adoption is permitted and as such

 the FASB issued ASU 2016-01
 Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial&#13;Assets and Financial Liabilities. ASU 2016-01 requires that most equity investments be measured at fair value
 with subsequent&#13;changes in fair value recognized in net income. The pronouncement also impacts financial liabilities under the fair value option&#13;and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual reporting periods&#13;beginning after December 15

Description
of the Company

Stony
Hill Corp. (formerly First Fixtures
 Inc. or the &#147;Company&#148;) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 21
2014 and established a fiscal year end of March 31. Effective October 24
 2016 the Company changed its name from First Fixtures
Inc. to Stony Hill Corp. The Company is organized for various investments to be made under the Stony Hill brand as well as to
conduct any other related business and activities. The Company is the owner and has right to intellectual property
 including
trademark
 trade dress
 images
 likenesses and other associated intellectual property such as the name &#34;Stony Hill&#34;
related to Damian Marley.



On
November 4
 2016
 the Company
 entered into a Share Exchange Agreement by and among the Company
 Stony Hill Ventures Corp. (&#147;Stony
Hill Ventures&#148;)
 and the holders of common stock of Stony Hill Ventures
 which consisted of 26 stockholders. Stony Hill
Ventures was incorporated on March 15
 2016
 in Nevada and was organized for various investments under the Stony Hill brand as
well as to conduct any other related business and activities.

Under
the terms and conditions of the Share Exchange Agreement
 the Company offered
 sold and issued 10
830
000 shares of common stock
of the Company in consideration for all the issued and outstanding shares in Stony Hill Ventures. The effect of the issuance is
that the former Stony Hill Ventures stockholders obtained approximately 73% of the then issued and outstanding shares of common
stock of the Company
 and Stony Hill Ventures became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and now represents the Company&#146;s
principal business.

As
a result of the Merger
 Damian Marley became the Company&#146;s President and Chief Executive Officer and sole member of the
Board of Directors
 and is the holder of 3
150
000 shares
 or 21.2%
 of the outstanding common stock of the Company. Dan Dalton
became the Company&#146;s Treasurer and is the holder of 2
250
000 shares
 or 15.1%
 of the outstanding common stock of the Company.
John Brady became the Company&#146;s new Secretary and is holder of 2
000
000 shares
 or 13.4%
 of the outstanding common stock
of the Company. The Company&#146;s new officers and sole director
 therefore
 controlled an aggregate of 7
400
000
 or 49.8%
of the outstanding common stock of the Company after the transaction.

The
merger between the Company and Stony Hill Ventures was treated as a reverse acquisition for financial statement reporting purposes
with Stony Hill Ventures deemed the accounting acquirer and the Company deemed the accounting acquiree. Accordingly
 Stony Hill
Ventures&#146; assets
 liabilities and results of operations became the historical financial statements of the Company. No step-up
in basis or intangible assets or goodwill was recorded in this transaction. In connection with the Share Exchange Agreement
 the
Company paid $325
000 to the former shareholders of Stony Hill and assumed $1
842 of accounts payable and $49
524 of an amount
owed to the former CEO of the Company
 which has been recorded as an expense of the reverse merger in the accompanying statement
of operations for the period ended December 31
2016. Prior to the Share Exchange
 6
002
584 shares of the Company&#146;s then
outstanding common stock were cancelled
 and the remaining 4
001
757 shares of common stock were considered to be shares issued
upon the reverse merger.

On
October 3
 2016
 the Company declared a 1 for 10 stock split.&#160;All share and per share amounts have been retro actively restated
as if the split had occurred as of the earliest period presented

Going
concern

These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize
its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. As reflected in the consolidated
financial statements
 the Company has only recently started to generate revenues from its business operations and as of March
31
 2017
 and has incurred a net loss of $515
920 and used $150
835 of cash from operating activities during the fiscal year ended
March 31
 2017. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within
one year after the date the financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

The
Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital and to ultimately
achieve sustainable revenues and income from operations. During the fiscal year ended March 31
 2017
 the Company raised $1
125
000
through the sale of 937
500 aggregate shares of its common stock to accredited investors. However
 the Company will need and is
currently working on obtaining additional funds to operate its business through and beyond the date of this Form 10-K filing.
There is no assurance that such funds will be available or at terms acceptable to the Company. Even if the Company is able to
obtain additional financing
 it may contain undue restrictions and covenants on its operations
 in the case of debt financing
or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders in the case of convertible debt and equity financing.



































The entire disclosure for the general note to the financial statements for the reporting entity which may include
 descriptions of the basis of presentation
 business description
 significant accounting policies
 consolidations
 reclassifications
 new pronouncements not yet adopted and changes in accounting principles.

Principles
of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary
 Vita Products LLC
 and
Vita CBD LLC
 an 80% owned entity
 both State of Washington Limited Liability Companies. Intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Management evaluates its investments on an individual basis for purposes of
determining whether or not consolidation is appropriate.

Use
of Estimates and Assumptions

Preparation
of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Among
other things
 management estimates include the collectability of its accounts receivable
 recoverability of inventory
 assumptions
made in determining impairment of investments and intangible assets
 accruals for potential liabilities
 and realization of deferred
tax assets. These estimates generally involve complex issues and require judgments
 involve analysis of historical information
and the prediction of future trends
 and are subject to change from period to period. Actual amounts could differ significantly
from these estimates.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The
Company follows paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Paragraph 820-10-35-37&#148;) to
measure the fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for
disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value
in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP)
 and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures
 Paragraph 820-10-35-37
establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three
(3) broad levels. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:



Level
    1
    
Quoted
    market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.

    
    
    

Level
    2
    
Pricing
    inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable
    as of the reporting date.

    
    
    

Level
    3
    
Pricing
    inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.



Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models
 discounted cash flow methodologies or
similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.

The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within
more than one level described above
 the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement of the instrument.

The
carrying amounts of the Company&#146;s financial assets and liabilities
 such as accounts receivables and accounts payable
 approximate
their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. The Company uses Level 3 inputs for its investments.

Revenue
Recognition

The
Company receives revenue from two main sources - license fees and sale of products. For license fees
 revenue arrangements provide
for the payment of contractually determined monthly ongoing fees in consideration for the grant of right to use intellectual property
of the Company
 including trademark
 trade dress
 images
 likenesses and other associated intellectual property
 such as the name
&#147;Stony Hill&#148; related to Damian Marley and in some cases mutually agreed upon marketing and special appearances by
certain members of the Company. Revenue from product sales relate to shipments of cannabidiol (&#147;CBD&#148;) brand products.
There is no right of returns other than for goods damaged during shipment.

For
both license fees and sale of products
 revenue is recognized when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 (ii) all
obligations have been substantially performed pursuant to the terms of the arrangement
 (iii) amounts are fixed or determinable
and (iv) the collectibility of amounts is reasonably assured.

Shipping
Cost

The
Company recognizes amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction related to shipping as revenue. The costs incurred by the
Company for shipping are classified as cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.



The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense for the fiscal periods ended March 31
 2017 and 2016 amounted
to $15
414 and nil
 respectively
 and are included in &#34;General and Administrative expenses&#34; in our Consolidated Statements
of Operations.



Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined principally on a first-in-first-out average cost basis. Inventories
consists of finished goods held for sale. Management regularly reviews inventory quantities on-hand and records an inventory provision
for excess or obsolete inventory based on the future expected demand for our products. Inventory write-downs are measured as the
difference between the cost of the inventory and market value
 based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently
difficult to assess. There was no provision for inventory obsolescence necessary as of March 31
 2017 and 2016.

Earnings
(Loss) per Share 

The
basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company&#146;s net income (loss) available to common shareholders
by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing
the Company&#146;s net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the period. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted average number of shares adjusted
for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share
due to the lack of dilutive items. For the fiscal periods ended March 31
 2017 and 2016
 there were no common stock equivalents
outstanding.

Weighted
average number of shares outstanding has been retroactively restated for the equivalent number of shares received by the accounting
acquirer as a result of the reverse merger as if these shares had been outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest period
presented.





are not required to be consolidated
 the Company uses either the equity method or the cost method of accounting. The Company uses
the equity method for unconsolidated equity investments in which the Company is considered to have significant influence over
the operations of the investee. The Company uses the cost method for all other investments. Under the cost method
 there is no
change to the cost basis unless there is an other-than-temporary decline in value or dividends are received. If the decline is
determined to be other-than-temporary
 the Company writes down the cost basis of the investment to a new cost basis that represents
realizable value. Distributions received from the income of an investee on cost method investments are included in &#34;Equity
method investments (loss)/income
 net.&#34; Investments accounted for under the equity method or cost method of accounting above
are included in the caption &#34;Equity investments&#34; on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 31
 2017
 management
estimates that the cost basis approximates the fair market value.

Intangible
Asset

Intangible
assets are recorded when such assets are acquired and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset. The
Company regularly reviews intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful lives have changed
from the original estimate or that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist
the Company assesses the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows
associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments
if any
 are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which the
impairment determination was made.

Income
Taxes

The
Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In
May 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts
with Customers. ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition
guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. Under ASU
2014-09
 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that
reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition
 the standard
requires disclosure of the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
The FASB has recently issued ASU 2016-08
 ASU 2016-10
 ASU 2016-11
 ASU 2016-12
 ASU 2016-20
 and ASU 2017-05
 all of which clarify
certain implementation guidance within ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December
15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods
therein. The standard can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method)
or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application
(the cumulative catch-up transition method). The Company is currently in the process of analyzing the information necessary to
determine the impact of adopting this new guidance on its financial position
 results of operations
 and cash flows. The Company
will adopt the provisions of this statement in the quarter beginning April 1
 2018.

In
February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases. This update will require the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a
corresponding lease liability
 initially measured at the present value of the lease payments
 for all leases with terms longer
than 12 months. For operating leases
 the asset and liability will be expensed over the lease term on a straight-line basis
 with
all cash flows included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. For finance leases
 interest on the lease liability
will be recognized separately from the amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statement of comprehensive income and the
repayment of the principal portion of the lease liability will be classified as a financing activity while the interest component
will be included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting
periods beginning after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption
 leases will be recognized and measured
at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its financial statements and related disclosures.

In
January 2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-01
 &#34;Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business.&#34;
The new guidance clarifies the definition of a business and provides further guidance for evaluating whether a transaction will
be accounted for as an acquisition of an asset or a business. The new standard will become effective beginning in the first quarter
of fiscal 2019. However
 early adoption is permitted and as such
 the Company adopted this pronouncement in January 2017. Adoption
did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

In
January 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-01
 Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities. ASU 2016-01 requires that most equity investments be measured at fair value
 with subsequent
changes in fair value recognized in net income. The pronouncement also impacts financial liabilities under the fair value option
and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15
 2017
 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently evaluating the potential
effects of adopting the provisions of ASU 2016-01.

Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB
 including its Emerging Issues Task Force
 the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants
 and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact
on the Company's present or future consolidated financial statements.&#160;

The
Company applied the provisions of ASC 805
 Business Combinations and ASU 2017-01
 Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying
the Definition of a Business
 in accounting for the Asset Purchase Agreement. Under this guidance
 the Company accounted for the
transaction as an asset purchase. As such
 the Company recorded an intangible asset of $1
138
135 consisting of the VitaCBD brand
and $5
865 of inventory received from mCig. The intangible is being amortized over a period of 5 years
 the estimated life of
the brand acquired. Amortization totaled $19
956 for the fiscal year ended March 31
 2017 and will total $227
627 in each of the
following 5 years.

In
accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement
 if the average common stock market price of the Company&#146;s common stock held
by mCig falls below $1.57 per share
 or $550
000 total value (&#147;Market Value&#148;)
 during any 7-day period during the
first year following the Second Stock Issuance (May 24
 2017)
 then the Company is obligated to issue to mCig additional shares
of the Company&#146;s common stock to increase the then Market Value held by mCig to $550
000. As of March 31
 2017
 the trading
price of common stock held by mCig was above the Market Value threshold.

The
Company has no tax provision for any period presented due to our history of operating losses. As of March 31
 2017
 the Company
had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $524
000 that may be available to reduce future years' taxable income through
2037. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements
as management has determined that their realization of the Company&#146;s net deferred tax assets of approximately $178
000 was
not likely to occur and accordingly
 the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to
tax loss carry-forward.s.

The
Company adopted accounting rules which address the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on
a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under these rules
 the Company may recognize the tax benefit from
an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
authorities
 based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such
a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. These accounting rules also provide guidance on de-recognition
 classification
 interest and penalties on income taxes
accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. As of March 31
 2017
 no liability for unrecognized tax benefits
was required to be recorded.

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary
 Vita Products LLC
 and
Vita CBD LLC
 an 80% owned entity
 both State of Washington Limited Liability Companies. Intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Management evaluates its investments on an individual basis for purposes of
determining whether or not consolidation is appropriate.




Preparation
of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Among
other things
 management estimates include the collectability of its accounts receivable
 recoverability of inventory
 assumptions
made in determining impairment of investments and intangible assets
 accruals for potential liabilities
 and realization of deferred
tax assets. These estimates generally involve complex issues and require judgments
 involve analysis of historical information
and the prediction of future trends
 and are subject to change from period to period. Actual amounts could differ significantly
from these estimates.




The
Company follows paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Paragraph 820-10-35-37&#148;) to
measure the fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for
disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value
in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP)
 and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures
 Paragraph 820-10-35-37
establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three
(3) broad levels. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:



Level
    1
    
Quoted
    market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.

    
    
    

Level
    2
    
Pricing
    inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly observable
    as of the reporting date.

    
    
    

Level
    3
    
Pricing
    inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.



Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models
 discounted cash flow methodologies or
similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.

The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within
more than one level described above
 the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement of the instrument.

The
carrying amounts of the Company&#146;s financial assets and liabilities
 such as accounts receivables and accounts payable
 approximate
their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. The Company uses Level 3 inputs for its investments.




The
Company receives revenue from two main sources - license fees and sale of products. For license fees
 revenue arrangements provide
for the payment of contractually determined monthly ongoing fees in consideration for the grant of right to use intellectual property
of the Company
 including trademark
 trade dress
 images
 likenesses and other associated intellectual property
 such as the name
&#147;Stony Hill&#148; related to Damian Marley and in some cases mutually agreed upon marketing and special appearances by
certain members of the Company. Revenue from product sales relate to shipments of cannabidiol (&#147;CBD&#148;) brand products.
There is no right of returns other than for goods damaged during shipment.

For
both license fees and sale of products
 revenue is recognized when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 (ii) all
obligations have been substantially performed pursuant to the terms of the arrangement
 (iii) amounts are fixed or determinable
and (iv) the collectibility of amounts is reasonably assured.




The
Company recognizes amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction related to shipping as revenue. The costs incurred by the
Company for shipping are classified as cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.




The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense for the fiscal periods ended March 31
 2017 and 2016 amounted
to $15
414 and nil
 respectively
 and are included in &#34;General and Administrative expenses&#34; in our Consolidated Statements
of Operations.




Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined principally on a first-in-first-out average cost basis. Inventories
consists of finished goods held for sale. Management regularly reviews inventory quantities on-hand and records an inventory provision
for excess or obsolete inventory based on the future expected demand for our products. Inventory write-downs are measured as the
difference between the cost of the inventory and market value
 based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently
difficult to assess. There was no provision for inventory obsolescence necessary as of March 31
 2017 and 2016.




The
basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company&#146;s net income (loss) available to common shareholders
by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing
the Company&#146;s net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the period. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted average number of shares adjusted
for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share
due to the lack of dilutive items. For the fiscal periods ended March 31
 2017 and 2016
 there were no common stock equivalents
outstanding.

Weighted
average number of shares outstanding has been retroactively restated for the equivalent number of shares received by the accounting
acquirer as a result of the reverse merger as if these shares had been outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest period
presented.




For investments that
are not required to be consolidated
 the Company uses either the equity method or the cost method of accounting. The Company uses
the equity method for unconsolidated equity investments in which the Company is considered to have significant influence over the
operations of the investee. The Company uses the cost method for all other investments. Under the cost method
 there is no change
to the cost basis unless there is an other-than-temporary decline in value or dividends are received. If the decline is determined
to be other-than-temporary
 the Company writes down the cost basis of the investment to a new cost basis that represents realizable
value. Distributions received from the income of an investee on cost method investments are included in &#34;Equity method investments
(loss)/income
 net.&#34; Investments accounted for under the equity method or cost method of accounting above are included in
the caption &#34;Equity investments&#34; on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 31
 2017
 management estimates that
the cost basis approximates the fair market value.




Intangible
assets are recorded when such assets are acquired and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset. The
Company regularly reviews intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful lives have changed
from the original estimate or that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist
the Company assesses the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows
associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments
if any
 are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which the
impairment determination was made.




The
Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.




In
May 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts
with Customers. ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition
guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. Under ASU
2014-09
 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that
reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition
 the standard
requires disclosure of the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
The FASB has recently issued ASU 2016-08
 ASU 2016-10
 ASU 2016-11
 ASU 2016-12
 ASU 2016-20
 and ASU 2017-05
 all of which clarify
certain implementation guidance within ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December
15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods
therein. The standard can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method)
or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application
(the cumulative catch-up transition method). The Company is currently in the process of analyzing the information necessary to
determine the impact of adopting this new guidance on its financial position
 results of operations
 and cash flows. The Company
will adopt the provisions of this statement in the quarter beginning April 1
 2018.

In
February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases. This update will require the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a
corresponding lease liability
 initially measured at the present value of the lease payments
 for all leases with terms longer
than 12 months. For operating leases
 the asset and liability will be expensed over the lease term on a straight-line basis
 with
all cash flows included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. For finance leases
 interest on the lease liability
will be recognized separately from the amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statement of comprehensive income and the
repayment of the principal portion of the lease liability will be classified as a financing activity while the interest component
will be included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting
periods beginning after December 15
 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption
 leases will be recognized and measured
at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its financial statements and related disclosures.

In
January 2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-01
 &#34;Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business.&#34;
The new guidance clarifies the definition of a business and provides further guidance for evaluating whether a transaction will
be accounted for as an acquisition of an asset or a business. The new standard will become effective beginning in the first quarter
of fiscal 2019. However
 early adoption is permitted and as such
 the Company adopted this pronouncement in January 2017. Adoption
did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

In
January 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-01
 Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities. ASU 2016-01 requires that most equity investments be measured at fair value
 with subsequent
changes in fair value recognized in net income. The pronouncement also impacts financial liabilities under the fair value option
and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15
