In this annual report
 unless otherwise specified
As used in this current report and unless otherwise indicated
 the terms &#8220;we&#8221;
 &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; mean Nate&#8217;s Food Co.
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on January 12
 2000 under the name Capital Resources Alliance
 Inc. At inception
 we were a development stage company in the business of mining and exploration. On May 19
 2014 our company completed a reverse merger with Nate&#8217;s Pancakes
 Inc.
 an Indiana company
 with Nate&#8217;s Pancakes being the surviving entity. In May 2014
 we changed our name from Capital Resource Alliance
In connection with the reverse merger
 we became a food manufacturing and product company
 and in May 2014
 we executed a licensing agreement with Nate&#8217;s Pancakes to market and sell &#8220;Nate&#8217;s Homemade&#8221;
On April 6
 2017
 our board of directors and a majority of our shareholders approved the filing of Restated Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized shares of common stock of our company from Five Hundred Million (500
000
000) to One Billion Five Hundred Million 1
500
000
000. The Restated Articles of Incorporation to effect the increase of common stock was filed with the Secretary of State for the State of Colorado on July 26
We are a food manufacturing and product company that manufactures
 distributes and sells ready-to-use
On August 23
 2016
The license agreement is for a term of twenty (20) years. Our company has the right to renew the license agreement for successive ten (10) year period by paying $1
000
Our company shall pay a royalty equal to Three Percent (3%) of the Gross Revenue from the licensed products. Gross revenue is defined as total revenue minus discounts and allowances. The license requires that we pay a minimum monthly fee of $7
500 beginning twelve (12) months from the execution of the license agreement (June 1
 2015) which is against the 3% royalty. The fee began accruing on June 1
 2015. As at May 31
 2018 and May 31
 2017
 accrued fees are $0 and $103
500 respectively
Since the company temporarily halted all production in January 2018
 halted sales on our on-line store shortly thereafter
 the company has had no revenues since March 31
 2019.&nbsp; The holders of the license have agreed to accept a buy-out of $0.00
 and halt the accrual of any additional minimum fees in the future.&nbsp; The company will
 from April 1
 2019
 party suppliers and manufacture the product for sales. Our company may also develop and create additional flavors such as chocolate
 blueberry
Our company also has the option
 at our election
 to purchase the intellectual property associated to the license agreement.&nbsp; Since the buy-out option is calculated to be an amount equal to the revenue for the 12 months immediately prior to the buy-out
 the Company has elected to buy-out the license
 effective March 1
Through Nate&#8217;s Homemade we sell a ready-to-use
 pre-mixed pancake and waffle batter delivered in a pressurized can. Our current product is an original flavor of pancake and waffle batter. We are currently in the process of developing additional flavors and products with the goal to have 10 products in development in 2019. Currently
We have delivered samples and will continue to deliver samples of our products to retail chains such as Wal-Mart
 Target
 Sam&#8217;s Club
 Costco
 Kroger
To date
 our sales have primarily been through our online store at www.nateshomemade.com. We continue presenting the product and providing samples to distributors and retailers. We have prepared several advertisements for placement in various grocery industry related journals and magazines
Raw materials used in our products include cans
 valves
 caps
 flour and other commodities. We continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these raw materials to enable us to take appropriate action to obtain the ingredients and packaging we need for production. Although the prices of our principal raw materials may fluctuate based on adverse weather
 the economy
 and other conditions
We operate in a highly competitive environment. We have numerous competitors of varying sizes
 including manufacturers of private label products
 as well as manufacturers of other branded food products
 which compete for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars. We compete with large conventional consumer packaged foods companies. We also compete with natural and organic consumer packaged foods companies. At present
Competitive factors in our industry include product innovation
 product quality
 price
 brand recognition and loyalty
 product variety and ingredients
 product packaging and package design
 effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity
As a manufacturer and distributor of food products
 we are subject to a number of food-related regulations
 including the Federal Food
 Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. This comprehensive regulatory framework governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients)
 labeling
 packaging
regulates holding
specifies the standards of identity for certain foods
In March 2014
 the FDA issued a proposed rule that would make significant changes to the information appearing in
 and the format of
 the nutrition facts appearing on food labels. In July 2015
 the FDA issued a supplemental proposed rule to establish a reference value for added sugars and to require a declaration of the percent daily value of added sugars on the food label. The proposed rule would also revise the footnote in the nutrition label regarding the percent daily value. It is not clear whether FDA will issue final regulation or
 if it does
In addition
 the FDA enforces the Public Health Service Act and regulations issued thereunder
 which authorizes regulatory activity necessary to prevent the introduction
 transmission
 or spread of communicable diseases. These regulations require
 for example
 pasteurization of milk and milk products. The FDA also is implementing the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 (&#8220;FSMA&#8221;) which
 among other things
 mandates that the FDA adopt preventive controls to be implemented by farms
 warehouses
In September 2015
 FDA released final rules implementing the Produce Safety and Current Good Manufacturing Practices
 Hazard Analysis and Risk Based Preventive Controls (HARPC) requirements for human food and animal food
 which was a major milestone in the implementation of FSMA. The final rules revise the FDA&#8217;s food safety regulations by: (1) codifying good agricultural practices and water fertilizer action limits
 (2) updating and revising certain requirements in the existing current good manufacturing practices regulations (current 21 CFR Part 110)
 (3) requiring the establishment and implementation of a food safety system that includes an analysis of hazards and risk-based preventive controls and sets requirements for a written food safety plan
We are subject to numerous other federal
 state
 and local regulations involving such matters as the licensing and registration of manufacturing facilities
 enforcement by government health agencies of standards for our products
 inspection of our facilities
 and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products. In response to food-borne illness events
 FDA scrutiny of the food and beverage industry has increased over the past few years
We are subject to various labeling requirements with respect to our products at the federal
 state
 and local levels. At the federal level
 the FDA has authority to review product labeling
 and the Federal Trade Commission may review labeling and advertising materials
 including online and television advertisements to determine if advertising materials are misleading. Similarly
 many states review dairy product labels to determine whether they comply with applicable state laws. In addition
 the European Union has issued and enforces rules governing foodstuff labeling
 nutrition
We currently have the exclusive license to all intellectual property held by IPC

Our financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern
 which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However
 our company has negative working capital
 recurring losses
In the coming year
 our company&#8217;s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of our business
 maintaining our good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
Historically
 we have mostly relied upon internally generated funds such as shareholder loans and advances to finance our operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital by retaining net earnings or through future public or private offerings of our company&#8217;s stock or through loans from private investors
Our Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section discusses our financial statements
 which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis
 management evaluates its estimates and judgments
 including those related to revenue recognition
 accrued expenses
 financing operations
 and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition
 changes in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements
 which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Nate&#8217;s Food Co. (the Company) as of May 31
 2018 and 2017
 and the related statements of operations
 stockholders&#8217; equity (deficit)
 and cash flows for the years then ended
 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion
 the financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of May 31
 2018 and 2017
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
 we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management

ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10
 a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken may be recognized only if it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that the position is sustainable upon examination
 based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all the relevant information. A liability (including interest and penalties
 if applicable) is established to the extent a current benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain tax position. Related interest and penalties

Long-lived assets such as property and equipment are stated at their fair value acquisition cost and reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Amortization of long-lived assets are calculated by the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. When required impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows
 market value of similar assets
 if available
 or independent appraisals
 if required. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows
 an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. When fair values are not available

 Fair Value Measurements (ASC Topic 820)
 which defines fair value

The standard provides a consistent definition of fair value which focuses on an exit price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard also prioritizes

The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 260
. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method for outstanding warrants and options and using the if-converted method for convertible debt and convertible preferred stock.

As of May 31
 2018
 the end of our fiscal year covered by this report
 we carried out an evaluation
 under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer (our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (our principal financial officer and principle accounting officer)
 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting responsibility
 estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of control procedures. The objectives of internal control include providing management with reasonable
 but not absolute
 assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition
 and that transactions are executed in accordance with management&#8217;s authorization and recorded properly to permit the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31
 2018. In making this assessment
. Our management has concluded that
 as of May 31
 2018
A material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency
 or combination of control deficiencies
Management identified the following material weakness during its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of May 31
: Our company does not have any independent directors. We intend to obtain at least two independent directors during the year ended May 31
: Ineffective controls over financial reporting: Our company intends to hire additional staff members
 either as employees or consultants
 prior to May 31
 2018. These additional staff members will be responsible for making sure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed and submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported as and when required and will the staff members will have segregated responsibilities with regard to these responsibilities. The costs associated with the hiring the additional staff members will increase our company&#8217;s Sales
 General and Administration (SG&amp;A) Expense. It is anticipated the cost of the new staff members will be approximately $60
000 per year. As of May 31
 2018
 we have no full-time employees with the requisite expertise in the key functional areas of finance and accounting. As a result
: Should at least two independent directors be appointed
: We need to prepare written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting to establish a formal process to close our books monthly on an accrual basis and account for all transactions
 including equity transactions
 and prepare
As our resources allow
 we will add financial personnel to our management team. We plan to prepare written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting to establish a formal process to close our books monthly on an accrual basis and account for all transactions
As of May 31
 2018
 our company has not taken any remediation actions to address these weaknesses in our controls even though they were identified during the year. Our company&#8217;s management expects
 once it is in the financial position to do so
 to hire additional staff in our accounting department to be able to segregate the duties. Our company expects that the expense will be approximately $60
Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance
 interpretation of existing and/or changing rules and principles
 segregation of management duties
 scale of organization
 and personnel factors. Internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis
 however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce
 though not eliminate
 this risk. Therefore
 even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended May 31
 2018 that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect

Under Rule 13d-3
 a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who
 directly or indirectly
 through any contract
 arrangement
 understanding
 relationship
 or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power
 which includes the power to vote
 or to direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power
 which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if
 for example
 persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition
 shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example
 upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person
 the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As a result
 the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in this table does not necessarily reflect the person&#8217;s actual ownership or voting power with respect to the number of shares of common stock actually outstanding on November 15
 2018. As of November 15

 2017
 the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &amp;#8220;Act&amp;#8221;) resulting in significant modifications&#13;to existing law including lowering the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. In addition to applying the new lower corporate tax&#13;rate in 2018 and thereafter to any taxable income we may have
 the legislation affects the way we can use and carry forward net&#13;operating losses previously accumulated and results in a revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded on our balance&#13;sheet. The Company has completed the accounting for the effects of the Act during the period ended May 31

The holder shall be entitled to convert any portion of the outstanding and unpaid conversion amount into fully paid and&#13;non-assessable shares of common Stock. The conversion price is the 45% discount to the lowest traded price during the previous&#13;20 trading days to the date of a conversion notice. The Company may redeem the note at rates ranging from 125% to 150% depending&#13;on the redemption date.

 &amp;#8220;Accounting for&#13;Income Taxes.&amp;#8221; Under this method
 income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for&#13;the current year; and
 (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized&#13;in an entity&amp;#8217;s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates&#13;expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.&#13;The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period&#13;that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the&#13;weight of available positive and negative evidence

 a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected&#13;to be taken may be recognized only if it is &amp;#8220;more likely than not&amp;#8221; that the position is sustainable upon examination
&#13;based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax&#13;benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge&#13;of all the relevant information. A liability (including interest and penalties
 if applicable) is established to the extent a&#13;current benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain&#13;tax position. Related interest and penalties

 Fair Value Measurements (&amp;#34;ASC Topic 820&amp;#34;)
 which defines fair value
 establishes a framework&#13;for measuring fair value
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard provides a consistent definition&#13;of fair value which focuses on an exit price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an&#13;orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard also prioritizes

 &amp;#34;&lt;i&gt;Earnings&#13;per Share&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#34;. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income&#13;statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average&#13;number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares&#13;outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method for outstanding warrants and options and using the if-converted&#13;method for convertible debt and convertible preferred stock.

 &amp;#8220;Accounting for&#13;Income Taxes.&amp;#8221; Under this method
 income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for&#13;the current year; and
 (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized&#13;in an entity&amp;#8217;s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates&#13;expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.&#13;The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period&#13;that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the&#13;weight of available positive and negative evidence

 a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected&#13;to be taken may be recognized only if it is &amp;#8220;more likely than not&amp;#8221; that the position is sustainable upon examination
&#13;based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax&#13;benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge&#13;of all the relevant information. A liability (including interest and penalties
 if applicable) is established to the extent a&#13;current benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain&#13;tax position. Related interest and penalties
 if any

 Fair Value Measurements (&amp;#34;ASC Topic 820&amp;#34;)
 which defines fair value
 establishes a framework&#13;for measuring fair value
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard provides a consistent definition&#13;of fair value which focuses on an exit price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an&#13;orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard also prioritizes

 &amp;#34;&lt;i&gt;Earnings&#13;per Share&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#34;. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income&#13;statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average&#13;number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares&#13;outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method for outstanding warrants and options and using the if-converted&#13;method for convertible debt and convertible preferred stock.

Organization
and Nature of Business

Nate&#8217;s
Food Co. (&#8220;we&#8221;
 &#8220;us&#8221;
 &#8220;our&#8221;
 the &#34;Company&#34; or the &#34;Registrant&#34;) was incorporated
in the state of Colorado on January 12
 2000. Nate&#8217;s Food Co. is domiciled in the state of Colorado
 and its corporate headquarters
are located in Huntington Beach
 California. The Company selected May 31 as its fiscal year end. On May 12
 2014
 Nate&#8217;s
Pancakes Inc. was incorporated in the state of Indiana. On May 19
 2014
 the Company completed a reverse merger between Nate&#8217;s
Pancakes
 Inc and Capital Resource Alliance. Nate&#8217;s Pancakes was the surviving Company. In May 2014
 the Company changed
its name from Capital Resource Alliance to Nate&#8217;s Food Co.

We
sell a ready-to-use
 pre-mixed pancake and waffle batter delivered in a pressurized can. Our current product is an original flavor
of pancake and waffle batter. Currently
 we have developed three flavors for our pancake and waffle mix. We plan to continue to
expand into other baked goods and other non-breakfast areas.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. A change in managements&#8217; estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on Nate&#8217;s Food Co. financial
condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Nate&#8217;s Food Co.&#8217;s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair
presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows
 the Company considers all short-term marketable securities purchased with maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Share-Based
Compensation

The
Company applies Topic 718 &#8220;Share-Based Payments&#8221; (&#8220;Topic 718&#8221;) to share-based compensation
 which requires
the measurement of the cost of services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair
value of the award. Compensation cost is recognized over the estimated service period (generally the vesting period) on the straight-line
method. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of options granted.

The
Company accounts for equity-based transactions with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50
 &#8220;Equity-Based
Payments to Non-Employees&#8221; (&#8220;Topic No. 505-50&#8221;). Topic No. 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions
with non-employees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments
issued
 whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued to non-employees
is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance to earn the equity instruments is reached (a
&#8220;performance commitment&#8221; which would include a penalty considered to be of a magnitude that is a sufficiently large
disincentive for nonperformance) or (ii) the date at which performance is complete.

Revenue
Recognition

It
is the Company&#8217;s policy that revenues and gains will be recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 605-10-25
 &#8220;Revenue
Recognition.&#8221; Under ASC Topic 605-10-25
 revenue earning activities are recognized upon the sale and delivery of its products.
For the years ended May 31
 2018 and 2017
 the Company has generated $7
020 and $4
486 in revenue from third parties
 respectively.
&#160;
&#160;
Income
Taxes

The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10
 &#8220;Accounting for
Income Taxes.&#8221; Under this method
 income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for
the current year; and
 (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized
in an entity&#8217;s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period
that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the
weight of available positive and negative evidence
 it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized.

ASC
740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10
 a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected
to be taken may be recognized only if it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that the position is sustainable upon examination
based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax
benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge
of all the relevant information. A liability (including interest and penalties
 if applicable) is established to the extent a
current benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain
tax position. Related interest and penalties
 if any
 are included as components of income tax expense and income taxes payable.

Research
and Development

We
employ processes at our principal manufacturing locations that emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product
improvement and quality control. In addition
 we conduct research activities related to the development of new products. Research
and development expense was $0 and $1
532 in fiscal year 2018 and 2017
 respectively.

Long-Lived
Assets

Long-lived
assets such as property and equipment are stated at their fair value acquisition cost and reviewed for impairment whenever facts
and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Amortization of long-lived assets are calculated by
the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. When required impairment losses on assets to be held and used are
recognized based on the fair value of the asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows
 market
value of similar assets
 if available
 or independent appraisals
 if required. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset
is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows
 an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying
amount and fair value of the asset. When fair values are not available
 the Company estimates fair value using the expected future
cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the recovery of the assets.

Depreciation
is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated
useful lives of depreciable assets are:



    
    
    

    
    
Useful
    Lives

    
    
5-10
    years


For
federal income tax purposes
 depreciation is computed under the modified accelerated cost recovery system. For financial statements
purposes
 depreciation is computed under the straight-line method.

We
completed an impairment evaluation of equipment at May 31
 2017 and recognized an impairment loss of $0 and $355
675 during the
years ended May 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.
&#160;
&#160;
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The
Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash
 accounts payable and accrued liabilities
 accrued expenses
 convertible
notes and notes payable. The carrying amounts of such financial instruments approximate their respective estimated fair value
due to the short-term maturities and approximate market interest rates of these instruments.

The
Company adopted ASC Topic 820
 Fair Value Measurements (&#34;ASC Topic 820&#34;)
 which defines fair value
 establishes a framework
for measuring fair value
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard provides a consistent definition
of fair value which focuses on an exit price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard also prioritizes
 within the measurement
of fair value
 the use of market-based information over entity specific information and establishes a three-level hierarchy for
fair value measurements based on the nature of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.

The
three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements is defined as follows:

Level
1 &#8211; inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;
liabilities in active markets;

Level
2 &#8211; inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets
 and
inputs that are observable for the asset or liability other than quoted prices
 either directly or indirectly
 including inputs
in markets that are not considered to be active; or directly or indirectly including inputs in markets that are not considered
to be active;

Level
3 &#8211; inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement

The
following table summarizes fair value measurements by level at May 31
 2018 and 2017
 measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

Basic
Earnings (Loss) Per Share

The
Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 260

per Share
statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average
number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares
outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method for outstanding warrants and options and using the if-converted
method for convertible debt and convertible preferred stock. In computing diluted EPS
 the average stock price for the period
is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS
excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.
&#160;
&#160;
For
the years ended May 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively
 the following warrants
 convertible notes and convertible preferred stock
were potentially dilutive.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In
June 2018
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07
 'Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based
Payment Accounting.&#8221; These amendments expand the scope of Topic 718
 Compensation&#8212;Stock Compensation (which currently
only includes share-based payments to employees) to include share-based payments issued to nonemployees for goods or services.
Consequently
 the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees and employees will be substantially aligned. The ASU supersedes
Subtopic 505-50
 Equity&#8212;Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. The guidance will be effective for the Company for its fiscal
year 2019
 with early adoption permitted
 but no earlier than a company&#8217;s adoption date of Topic 606
 Revenue from Contracts
with Customers.

In
May 2017
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09
 &#8220;Compensation &#8211; Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting.&#8221;
The amendments in this update provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based award require an
entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. The guidance will be effective for the Company for its fiscal year 2018
with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect this ASU to materially impact the Company&#8217;s financial statements

May 31
 2018








The
Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable
to a going concern
 which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
However
 the Company has negative working capital
 recurring losses
 and does not have an established source of revenues sufficient
to cover its operating costs. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern.
&#160;
&#160;
The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described
in the succeeding paragraphs and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include
any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

In
the coming year
 the Company&#8217;s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its
business
 maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
 and the
payment of expenses associated with operations and business developments. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required
to raise additional capital.

Historically
it has mostly relied upon internally generated funds such as shareholder loans and advances to finance its operations and growth.
Management may raise additional capital by retaining net earnings or through future public or private offerings of the Company&#8217;s
stock or through loans from private investors
 although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing.
The Company&#8217;s failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders.



































The entire disclosure when substantial doubt is raised about the ability to continue as a going concern. Includes
 but is not limited to
 principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern
 management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the ability to meet its obligations
 and management's plans that alleviated or are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern.

Typenex
Co

On
July 24
 2015
 the Company received financing in the amount of $93
000 from Typenex Co-Investment
 LLC with $13
000 cash discount
to the lender and incurred $8
000 in financing costs to third parties. The deferred financing costs were amortized over the life
of the note using the effective interest method. The $93
000 bears an 8% interest rate and matured in nine months. The holder
shall be entitled to convert any portion of the outstanding and unpaid conversion amount in to fully paid and non-assessable shares
of common stock. Conversion price is 50% of the average of the three lowest closing bid prices for the 15 previous consecutive
trading days prior to the payment date. The Company may prepay the note at any time at an amount equal to 120% of the outstanding
principal and the accrued and unpaid interest. The note was discounted for a derivative (see note 5 for details) and the discount
is being amortized over the life of the note using the effective interest method. On July 8
 2016
 the Company made a payment
of 50% of the balance then due in the amount of $57
000. The payment of $57
000 was applied to an interest penalty and accrued
interest. The Company entered into a Forbearance Agreement with Typenex regarding conversion of the balance of $57
000 debt into
shares of common stock at an agreed upon discount and frequency of conversions. During the year ended May 31
 2018
 27
575
932
shares of common stock were issued based on the True-Up conversion. We accounted for the true-up provision as a derivative. As

Aggregate
intrinsic value is the sum of the amounts by which the quoted market price of the Company's stock exceeded the exercise price
of the warrants at May 31
 2017
 for those warrants for which the quoted market price was in excess of the exercise price (&#34;in-the-money&#34;
warrants). As of May 31
 2017
 the aggregate intrinsic value of warrants outstanding was approximately $93
256 based on the closing
market price of $0.0028 on May 31
 2018.

The
Company determined that the warrants qualify for derivative accounting (see note 5).

We
did not provide any current or deferred U.S. federal income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because
we have experienced operating losses since inception. When it is more likely than not that a tax asset cannot be realized through
future income the Company must allow for this future tax benefit. We provided a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax
asset
 consisting of net operating loss carry forwards
 because management has determined that it is more likely than not that
we will not earn income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets during the carry forward period.

The
Company has not taken a tax position that
 if challenged
 would have a material effect on the financial statements for the years
ended May 31
 2018 and 2017 as applicable under FASB ASC 740. We did not recognize any adjustment to the liability for uncertain
tax position and therefore did not record any adjustment to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit on the balance sheet.
All tax returns for the Company remain open.
&#160;
&#160;
On
December 22
 2017
 the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) resulting in significant modifications
to existing law including lowering the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. In addition to applying the new lower corporate tax
rate in 2018 and thereafter to any taxable income we may have
 the legislation affects the way we can use and carry forward net
operating losses previously accumulated and results in a revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded on our balance
sheet. The Company has completed the accounting for the effects of the Act during the period ended May 31
 2018. Given that current
deferred tax assets are offset by a full valuation allowance
 these changes will have no impact on the balance sheet.

The
provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before
provision for income taxes. The sources and tax effects of the differences for the periods presented are as follows:

Nate&#8217;s
Food Co. (&#8220;we&#8221;
 &#8220;us&#8221;
 &#8220;our&#8221;
 the &#34;Company&#34; or the &#34;Registrant&#34;) was incorporated
in the state of Colorado on January 12
 2000. Nate&#8217;s Food Co. is domiciled in the state of Colorado
 and its corporate headquarters
are located in Huntington Beach
 California. The Company selected May 31 as its fiscal year end. On May 12
 2014
 Nate&#8217;s
Pancakes Inc. was incorporated in the state of Indiana. On May 19
 2014
 the Company completed a reverse merger between Nate&#8217;s
Pancakes
 Inc and Capital Resource Alliance. Nate&#8217;s Pancakes was the surviving Company. In May 2014
 the Company changed
its name from Capital Resource Alliance to Nate&#8217;s Food Co.

We
sell a ready-to-use
 pre-mixed pancake and waffle batter delivered in a pressurized can. Our current product is an original flavor
of pancake and waffle batter. Currently
 we have developed three flavors for our pancake and waffle mix. We plan to continue to
expand into other baked goods and other non-breakfast areas.




The
preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. A change in managements&#8217; estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on Nate&#8217;s Food Co. financial
condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Nate&#8217;s Food Co.&#8217;s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair
presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.




For
purposes of the statement of cash flows
 the Company considers all short-term marketable securities purchased with maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.




The
Company applies Topic 718 &#8220;Share-Based Payments&#8221; (&#8220;Topic 718&#8221;) to share-based compensation
 which requires
the measurement of the cost of services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair
value of the award. Compensation cost is recognized over the estimated service period (generally the vesting period) on the straight-line
method. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of options granted.

The
Company accounts for equity-based transactions with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50
 &#8220;Equity-Based
Payments to Non-Employees&#8221; (&#8220;Topic No. 505-50&#8221;). Topic No. 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions
with non-employees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments
issued
 whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued to non-employees
is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance to earn the equity instruments is reached (a
&#8220;performance commitment&#8221; which would include a penalty considered to be of a magnitude that is a sufficiently large
disincentive for nonperformance) or (ii) the date at which performance is complete.





It
is the Company&#8217;s policy that revenues and gains will be recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 605-10-25
 &#8220;Revenue
Recognition.&#8221; Under ASC Topic 605-10-25
 revenue earning activities are recognized upon the sale and delivery of its products.
For the years ended May 31
 2018 and 2017
 the Company has generated $7
020 and $4
486 in revenue from third parties
 respectively.





The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10
 &#8220;Accounting for
Income Taxes.&#8221; Under this method
 income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for
the current year; and
 (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized
in an entity&#8217;s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period
that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the
weight of available positive and negative evidence
 it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized.

ASC
740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10
 a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected
to be taken may be recognized only if it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that the position is sustainable upon examination
based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax
benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge
of all the relevant information. A liability (including interest and penalties
 if applicable) is established to the extent a
current benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain
tax position. Related interest and penalties
 if any
 are included as components of income tax expense and income taxes payable.




We
employ processes at our principal manufacturing locations that emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product
improvement and quality control. In addition
 we conduct research activities related to the development of new products. Research
and development expense was $0 and $1
532 in fiscal year 2018 and 2017
 respectively.





Long-lived
assets such as property and equipment are stated at their fair value acquisition cost and reviewed for impairment whenever facts
and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Amortization of long-lived assets are calculated by
the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. When required impairment losses on assets to be held and used are
recognized based on the fair value of the asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows
 market
value of similar assets
 if available
 or independent appraisals
 if required. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset
is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows
 an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying
amount and fair value of the asset. When fair values are not available
 the Company estimates fair value using the expected future
cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the recovery of the assets.

Depreciation
is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated
useful lives of depreciable assets are:



    
    
    

    
    
Useful
    Lives

    
    
5-10
    years


For
federal income tax purposes
 depreciation is computed under the modified accelerated cost recovery system. For financial statements
purposes
 depreciation is computed under the straight-line method.

We
completed an impairment evaluation of equipment at May 31
 2017 and recognized an impairment loss of $0 and $355
675 during the
years ended May 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.




The
Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash
 accounts payable and accrued liabilities
 accrued expenses
 convertible
notes and notes payable. The carrying amounts of such financial instruments approximate their respective estimated fair value
due to the short-term maturities and approximate market interest rates of these instruments.

The
Company adopted ASC Topic 820
 Fair Value Measurements (&#34;ASC Topic 820&#34;)
 which defines fair value
 establishes a framework
for measuring fair value
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard provides a consistent definition
of fair value which focuses on an exit price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard also prioritizes
 within the measurement
of fair value
 the use of market-based information over entity specific information and establishes a three-level hierarchy for
fair value measurements based on the nature of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.

The
three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements is defined as follows:

Level
1 &#8211; inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;
liabilities in active markets;

Level
2 &#8211; inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets
 and
inputs that are observable for the asset or liability other than quoted prices
 either directly or indirectly
 including inputs
in markets that are not considered to be active; or directly or indirectly including inputs in markets that are not considered
to be active;

Level
3 &#8211; inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement

The
following table summarizes fair value measurements by level at May 31
 2018 and 2017
 measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

The
Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 260

per Share
statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average
number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares
outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method for outstanding warrants and options and using the if-converted
method for convertible debt and convertible preferred stock. In computing diluted EPS
 the average stock price for the period
is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS
excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.
&#160;

For
the years ended May 31
 2018 and 2017

In
June 2018
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07
 'Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based
Payment Accounting.&#8221; These amendments expand the scope of Topic 718
 Compensation&#8212;Stock Compensation (which currently
only includes share-based payments to employees) to include share-based payments issued to nonemployees for goods or services.
Consequently
 the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees and employees will be substantially aligned. The ASU supersedes
Subtopic 505-50
 Equity&#8212;Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. The guidance will be effective for the Company for its fiscal
year 2019
 with early adoption permitted
 but no earlier than a company&#8217;s adoption date of Topic 606
 Revenue from Contracts
with Customers.

In
May 2017
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09
 &#8220;Compensation &#8211; Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting.&#8221;
The amendments in this update provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based award require an
entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. The guidance will be effective for the Company for its fiscal year 2018
with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect this ASU to materially impact the Company&#8217;s financial statements

Tabular disclosure of warrants or rights issued. Warrants and rights outstanding are derivative securities that give the holder the right to purchase securities (usually equity) from the issuer at a specific price within a certain time frame. Warrants are often included in a new debt issue to entice investors by a higher return potential. The main difference between warrants and call options is that warrants are issued and guaranteed by the company
 whereas options are exchange instruments and are not issued by the company. Also
 the lifetime of a warrant is often measured in years
 while the lifetime of a typical option is measured in months. Disclose the title of issue of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the aggregate amount of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding
 the date from which the warrants or rights are exercisable
 and the price at which the warrant or right is exercisable.

The estimated measure of the percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.
