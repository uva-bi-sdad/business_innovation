Certain statements made in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K are &ldquo;forward-looking statements&rdquo; regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations.
Such statements involve known and unknown risks
 uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results
 performance
or achievements to be materially different from any future results
 performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties.
Our plans and objectives are based
 in part
 on assumptions involving judgments with respect to
 among other things
 future economic
competitive and market conditions and future business decisions
 all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately
and many of which are beyond our control. Although we believe that our assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are
reasonable
 any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and
 therefore
 there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements
included in this Report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements
included herein particularly in view of the current state of our operations
 the inclusion of such information should not be regarded
as a statement by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved. Factors that could cause actual results
to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements include
 but are not limited to
 the factors
set forth herein under the headings &ldquo;Business
&rdquo; &ldquo;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations&rdquo; and &ldquo;Risk Factors&rdquo;. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking
statements for any reason. The terms &ldquo;we&rdquo;

Incorporated&nbsp;(&ldquo;we&rdquo;
 &ldquo;our&rdquo;
 &ldquo;us&rdquo; or&nbsp;&ldquo;Newtown&rdquo;) was incorporated in Delaware
on September 26
 2005. We are a corporation with limited operations and have very limited revenues from our business operations
since our incorporation in September 2005. Until December 31
 2007
 we held the exclusive license to exploit the Dreesen's Donut
Brand in the United States with the exception of the states of Florida and Pennsylvania
 and in Suffolk County
 New York
 which
Dreesen retained for itself. In August 2007 there was a change in control
 as detailed below
 and we discontinued our efforts to
promote the Dreesen's Donut Brand at that time. The license from Dreesen expired on December 31
 2007.


 2008
 we
implemented a 1 for 50 reverse stock split (the &ldquo;Reverse Split&rdquo;) of our Common Stock. Pursuant to the Reverse Split
each 50 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding was converted into one share of Common Stock.


 2013
we declared and paid a stock dividend on our outstanding Common Stock to stockholders of record as of August 15
 2013 (the &ldquo;Record
Date&rdquo;). As a result
 all stockholders on the Record Date received nine new shares of Common Stock for each share of Common
Stock owned by them as of the that date (the &ldquo;2013 Stock Dividend&rdquo;).


data contained in this Report has been retroactively restated to reflect the Reverse Split and the 2013 Stock Dividend and all
fractional shares
 if any
 as a result thereof have been rounded upward to the next whole share.


 2016
 our
authorized capital stock consisted of 100
000
000 shares of Common Stock and 1
000
000 shares of Preferred Stock of which 13
757
550
shares of Common Stock
 and no shares of Preferred Stock
 were issued and outstanding. All shares of Common Stock currently outstanding
are validly issued
 fully paid and non-assessable.




 2007 (the
&ldquo;Effective Date&rdquo;)
 we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the &ldquo;Purchase Agreement&rdquo;) with Moyo Partners
LLC
 a New York limited liability company (&ldquo;Moyo&rdquo;) and R&amp;R Biotech Partners
 LLC
 a Delaware limited liability
company (&ldquo;R&amp;R&rdquo; collectively with Moyo
 the &ldquo;Purchasers&rdquo;)
 pursuant to which we sold to them
 in the
aggregate
 approximately
 four million four hundred seventy nine thousand two hundred fifty (4
479
250) shares of our common stock
of our
Series A Preferred Stock
 par value $.001 per share (&ldquo;Series A Preferred Stock&rdquo;)
 each share convertible at the option
of the holder into
 approximately
 fourteen thousand eight hundred twenty (14
820) shares of Common Stock
proceeds
to us of $600
000. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock were convertible only to the extent there were a sufficient number of
shares of Common Stock available for issuance upon any such conversion.


(i) the Purchasers acquired control of Newtown
 with (a) R&amp;R acquiring nine million five hundred nine thousand four hundred
forty (9
509
440) shares of Common Stock (assuming the conversion by R&amp;R of the four hundred (400) shares of Series A Preferred
Stock it acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement into five million nine hundred twenty eight thousand (5
928
000) shares of
Common Stock) constituting 72% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock
 and (b) Moyo acquiring two million three
hundred seventy seven thousand three hundred sixty (2
377
360) shares of Common Stock (assuming the conversion by Moyo of its one
hundred (100) shares of Series A Preferred Stock it acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement into one million four hundred eighty
one thousand five hundred ten (1
481
510) shares of Common Stock) constituting 18% of the then issued and outstanding shares of
Common Stock; and (ii) in full satisfaction of our obligations under outstanding convertible promissory notes in the principal
amount of $960
000 (the &ldquo;December Notes&rdquo;)
 the Note holders of the December Notes converted an aggregate of $479
811
of principal and accrued interest into 274
200 shares of Common Stock and accepted a cash payment from us in the aggregate amount
of $625
030 for the remaining principal balance.


    
    



(i) Arnold P. Kling was appointed to our Board of Directors (&ldquo;Board&rdquo;) and served together with Vincent J. McGill
 a
then current director who continued to serve until August 20
 2007
 the effective date of his resignation from our Board; (ii)
all of our then officers and directors
 with the exception of Mr. McGill
 resigned from their respective positions with us; (iii)
our Board appointed Mr. Kling as president and Kirk M. Warshaw as chief financial officer and secretary; and (iv) we relocated
our headquarters to Chatham
 New Jersey.


resignation from our Board on August 20
 2007
 Mr. Kling became our sole director and president.


 2007
 we
effected an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to increase to 100
000
000 the number of authorized shares of Common
Stock available for issuance (the &ldquo;Charter Amendment&rdquo;). As a result of the Charter Amendment
 as of October 19
 2007
we had adequate shares of Common Stock available for issuance upon the conversion of all the issued and outstanding shares of Series
A Preferred Stock.


 2007
 the
holders of all the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock elected to convert all of their shares into shares
of Common Stock. As a result
 the 500 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding were exchanged for 7
407
540 shares of Common
Stock
 and all 500 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock were returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares of undesignated
preferred stock
 par value $.001 per shares. None of the Series A Preferred Stock were outstanding as of the Series A Preferred
Elimination Date.


 we sold
550
000 shares of restricted Common Stock to our Chief Financial Officer
 for $2
000. The issuance of these shares was exempt from
registration pursuant to Sections 4(2) and 4(6) or the Securities Act of 1933
 as amended (the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;). The stock certificate
representing these shares was imprinted with a legend restricting transfer unless pursuant to an effective registration statement
or an exemption from registration under the Act.


 2013
 Ironbound
Partners Fund
 LLC (&ldquo;Ironbound&rdquo;) acquired 9
509
440 shares of our outstanding Common Stock (the &ldquo;Acquired Shares&rdquo;)
for an aggregate purchase price of $15
000
 or $0.00157737 per share
 from the Chapter 7 Trustee of the Estates of Rodman &amp;
Renshaw
 LLC (&ldquo;Rodman&rdquo;)
 Direct Markets
 Inc.
 and Direct Markets Holdings
 Corp. in Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings
pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Cases No. 13-10087
 13-10088 and 13-10089).
The Acquired Shares constituted all the shares of Common Stock previously owned by R&amp;R
 an affiliate of Rodman
 and represented
69.1% of our total issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of May 6
 2013.


 2013
 Ironbound
loaned $100
000 to us and we issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $100
000 to Ironbound (the &ldquo;May
2013 Note&rdquo;). The May 2013 Note was initially issued with a two-year term and bore interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum
payable at maturity. The principal and accrued interest on the May 2013 Note was convertible into shares of Common Stock upon the
consummation of a &ldquo;Fundamental Transaction&rdquo; (as defined in the May 2013 Note) at the &ldquo;Conversion Price&rdquo;
(as defined in the May 2013 Note). The May 2013 Note was amended in July 2014 in accordance with the Amended and Restated Note
as described below.


 2014
 we raised
gross proceeds of $72
000 in a debt financing transaction with Ironbound and
 in connection therewith
 issued to Ironbound a convertible
promissory note (the &ldquo;2014 Note&rdquo;) in the principal amount of $72
000. The 2014 Note has a maturity date of August 31
2015 and bears interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum
 payable at maturity. The principal and accrued interest on the 2014 Note
is convertible
 at the election of Ironbound
 into shares of our Common Stock following the consummation of a &ldquo;Qualified
Financing&rdquo; (as defined in the 2014 Note)
 or upon the consummation of a &ldquo;Fundamental Transaction&rdquo; (as defined
in the 2014 Note) at the &ldquo;Conversion Price&rdquo; (as defined in the 2014 Note).


    
    



 on July 25
 2014
we issued an amended and restated convertible promissory note (the &ldquo;Amended and Restated Note&rdquo; and together with the
2014 Note
 the &ldquo;Prior Notes&rdquo;) to Ironbound in the principal amount of $100
000
 in substitution for the May 2013 Note.
The Amended and Restated Note extended the maturity of the May 2013 Note to August 31
 2015 and provided for the principal and
accrued interest on the May 2013 Note to be convertible
 at the election of Ironbound
 into shares of our Common Stock following
the consummation of a &ldquo;Qualified Financing&rdquo; (as defined in the May 2013 Note)
 or upon the consummation of a &ldquo;Fundamental
Transaction&rdquo; (as defined in the May 2013 Note) at the &ldquo;Conversion Price&rdquo; (as defined in the May 2013 Note). The
May 2013 Note otherwise remained unchanged.


2015
 the maturity dates of the Prior Notes was extended from August 31
 2015 to August 31
 2016.


 2015
 Mr.
Kling resigned from his position as our sole director and from his position as our President. Also on October 30
 2015
 Mr. Warshaw
resigned from his positions as our Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. Messrs. Kling&rsquo;s and Warshaw&rsquo;s resignation
were not due to any disagreement with the Company or its management on any matter relating to the Company&rsquo;s operations
 policies
or practices. Prior to Mr. Kling&rsquo;s resignation
 our Board of Directors appointed Jonathan J. Ledecky
 the managing member
of Ironbound
 our largest stockholder
 to fill the vacancy created by Mr. Kling&rsquo;s resignation and will assume the role of
President of the Company.


 2016
 we issued
a convertible promissory note (the &ldquo;2016 Note&rdquo; and together with the Prior Notes
 the &ldquo;Outstanding Notes&rdquo;)
in the principal amount of $10
000 to Ironbound. The 2016 Note has the same terms as the Prior Notes. The proceeds of the 2016
Note was and will be utilized by the Company to fund working capital needs.




our main purpose has been to serve as a vehicle to acquire an operating business and we are currently considered a &ldquo;shell&rdquo;
company in as much as we are not generating revenues
 do not own an operating business
 and have no specific plan other than to
engage in a merger or acquisition transaction with a yet-to-be identified operating company or business. Our principal business
objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with
an operating company or business. We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business
 industry
or geographical location and
 thus
 may acquire any type of business. The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken
by or under the supervision of our officers and directors. We have no employees and no material assets.


or understandings with any prospective business combination candidates and there are no assurances that we will find a suitable
business with which to combine. The implementation of our business objectives is wholly contingent upon a business combination
and/or the successful sale of our securities. We intend to utilize the proceeds of any offering
 any sales of equity securities
or debt securities
 bank and other borrowings or a combination of those sources to effect a business combination with a target
business which we believe may have significant growth potential. While we may
 under certain circumstances
 seek to effect business
combinations with more than one target business
 unless additional financing is obtained
 we will not have sufficient proceeds
remaining after an initial business combination to undertake additional business combinations.


company to enter into a merger with a shell company is the desire to establish a public trading market for its shares. Such a company
would hope to avoid the perceived adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself
 such as the time delays and significant
expenses incurred to comply with the various federal and state securities law that regulate initial public offerings.


resources
 unless and until additional financing is obtained we expect to have sufficient proceeds to effect only a single business
combination. Accordingly
 the prospects for our success will likely be dependent upon the future performance of a single business.
Unlike certain entities that have the resources to consummate several business combinations or entities operating in multiple industries
or multiple segments of a single industry
 we do not expect to have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the
possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. A target business may be dependent upon the development or market acceptance
of a single or limited number of products
 processes or services
 in which case there will be an even higher risk that the target
business will not prove to be commercially viable.


    
    



management to play any managerial role for us following a business combination. Although we intend to scrutinize closely the management
of a prospective target business in connection with our evaluation of a business combination with a target business
 our assessment
of management may be incorrect.


target business
 we expect to consider several factors
 including the following:
































are not intended to be exhaustive and any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular target business will be based
 to the
extent relevant
 on the above factors
 as well as other considerations we deem relevant. In connection with our evaluation of a
prospective target business
 we anticipate that we will conduct a due diligence review which will encompass
 among other things
meeting with incumbent management as well as a review of financial
 legal and other information.


to select and evaluate a target business (including conducting a due diligence review) and to structure and consummate the business
combination (including negotiating and documenting relevant agreements and preparing requisite documents for filing pursuant to
applicable corporate and securities laws) cannot be determined at this time. Our president intends to devote only a very small
portion of his time to our affairs
 and
 accordingly
 the consummation of a business combination may require a longer time than
if he devoted his full time to our affairs. However
 he will devote such time as he deems reasonably necessary to carry out our
business and affairs. The amount of time devoted to our business and affairs may vary significantly depending upon
 among other
things
 whether we have identified a target business or are engaged in active negotiation of a business combination. We expect
to use outside consultants
 advisors
 attorneys and accountants as necessary. We do not anticipate hiring any full-time employees
so long as we are seeking and evaluating business opportunities.


prospective target businesses will be brought to our attention from various sources
 including securities broker-dealers
 investment
bankers
 venture capitalists
 bankers and other members of the financial community
 including
 possibly
 the executive officers
and our affiliates.


 federal
and state tax laws and regulations have a significant impact upon the structuring of business combinations. We will evaluate the
possible tax consequences of any prospective business combination and will endeavor to structure a business combination so as to
achieve the most favorable tax treatment to our company
 the target business and our respective stockholders. There can be no assurance
that the Internal Revenue Service or relevant state tax authorities will ultimately assent to our tax treatment of a particular
consummated business combination. To the extent the Internal Revenue Service or any relevant state tax authorities ultimately prevail
in recharacterizing the tax treatment of a business combination
 there may be adverse tax consequences to our company
 the target
business
 and our respective stockholders.


    
    



or business by purchasing the securities of such company or business. However
 we do not intend to engage primarily in such activities.
Specifically
 we intend to conduct our activities so as to avoid being classified as an &quot;investment company&quot; under the
Investment Company Act of 1940
 as amended (the &ldquo;Investment Act&rdquo;) and therefore avoid application of the costly and
restrictive registration and other provisions of the Investment Company Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.


Company Act excepts from the definition of an &quot;investment company&quot; an entity which does not engage primarily in the business
of investing
 reinvesting or trading in securities
 or which does not engage in the business of investing
 owning
 holding or trading
&quot;investment securities&quot; (defined as &quot;all securities other than government securities or securities of majority-owned
subsidiaries&quot;) the value of which exceed 40% of the value of its total assets (excluding government securities
 cash or cash
items). We intend to operate any business in the future in a manner which will result in the availability of this exception from
the definition of an investment company. Consequently
 our acquisition of a company or business through the purchase and sale of
investment securities will be limited. Although we intend to act to avoid classification as an investment company
 the provisions
of the Investment Company Act are extremely complex and it is possible that we may be classified as an inadvertent investment company.
We intend to vigorously resist classification as an investment company
 and to take advantage of any exemptions or exceptions from
application of the Investment Company Act
 which allows an entity a one-time option during any three-year period to claim an exemption
as a &quot;transient&quot; investment company. The necessity of asserting any such resistance
 or making any claim of exemption
could be time consuming and costly
 or even prohibitive
 given our limited resources.


a business combination may arise
 such as appraisal rights afforded the stockholders of a target business under the laws of its
state of organization. This may prove to be deterrent to a particular combination.





IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDED
IN THIS REPORT
 YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS IN EVALUATING OUR BUSINESS
 OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US
 THAT WE CURRENTLY DEEM IMMATERIAL OR THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE FACED
BY OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY OR BUSINESS IN GENERAL
 SUCH AS COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS
 MAY ALSO IMPAIR OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS.
THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS.


FOR EVALUATING PROSPECTS.


we have no operating business or plans to develop one. We are currently seeking to enter into a merger or business combination
with another company. To date
 our efforts have been limited to meeting our regulatory filing requirements and searching for a
merger target.


ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN


 we have
incurred negative cash flow from operating activities and an accumulated deficit of $2
266
757 through March 31
 2016. For the
years ended March 31
 2016 and 2015
 we had net losses of $52
207 and $80
143
 respectively. We have spent
 and subject to obtaining
additional financing
 expect to continue to spend
 substantial amounts in connection with executing our business strategy. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.


    
    


WE
HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES AND NO REVENUES FROM OPERATIONS
 AND WILL NEED ADDITIONAL FINANCING IN ORDER TO EXECUTE ANY BUSINESS PLAN
AND HISTORICALLY RELIED UPON FUNDING FROM OUR MAJORITY STOCKHOLDER.


no revenues from operations to date and our cash on hand may not be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements during the next
twelve months. In addition
 we will not achieve any revenues (other than insignificant investment income) until
 at the earliest
the consummation of a merger and we cannot ascertain our capital requirements until such time. Further limiting our abilities to
achieve revenues
 in order to avoid status as an &quot;Investment Company&quot; under the Investment Company Act
 we can only invest
our funds prior to a merger in limited investments which do not invoke Investment Company status. There can be no assurance that
determinations ultimately made by us will permit us to achieve our business objectives.

 R&amp;R

11
 2013
 Rodman filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy petition.&nbsp; As a result
 we do not expect any further funding from R&amp;R.&nbsp;
Subsequent to our fiscal year ended March 31
 2013

 2013
 Ironbound acquired the 9

 Corp.
in Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Cases
No. 13-10087
 13-10088 and 13-10089). Since May 14
 2013 we have borrowed $[182
000] from Ironbound and issued the aforementioned
Outstanding Notes to it. As of March 31
 2016
 we have $4
555 on hand. Such funds will not be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements
during the next twelve months and we will require additional funds. We cannot provide assurance that adequate additional funds
will be available or
 if available
 will be offered on acceptable terms. Failure to receive adequate additional funding will cause
us to cease operations.

WE
WILL BE ABLE TO EFFECT AT MOST ONE MERGER
 AND THUS MAY NOT HAVE A DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS.


and we will most likely have the ability to effect only a single merger. This probable lack of diversification will subject us
to numerous economic
 competitive and regulatory developments
 any or all of which may have a material adverse impact upon the
particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to the consummation of a merger. We will become dependent upon the development
or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products
 processes or services.

WE
DEPEND SUBSTANTIALLY UPON OUR PRESIDENT tO MAKE ALL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS.

 Jonathan J. Ledecky. Notwithstanding the importance of Mr. Ledecky
we have not entered into any employment agreement or other understanding with Mr. Ledecky concerning compensation or obtained any
&quot;key man&quot; life insurance on any of his life. The loss of the services of Mr. Ledecky will have a material adverse effect
on our business objectives and success. We rely upon the expertise of Mr. Ledecky and do not anticipate that we will hire additional
personnel.

to receive compensation from a target company he or she identifies or provides services to in connection with a business combination.
A conflict of interest may arise between our management&rsquo;s personal pecuniary interest and their fiduciary duty to our stockholders.
Further
 our management&rsquo;s own pecuniary interest may at some point compromise their fiduciary duty to our stockholders. In
addition
 Mr. Ledecky
 our president and sole director
 is currently involved with other companies and conflicts in the pursuit
of business combinations with such other companies with which he and affiliates of our majority stockholder are

future be affiliated with

We are and will continue to be an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with

Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources
 technical expertise and managerial capabilities than
we do; consequently
 we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing
a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business
combination.


OF MANAGEMENT TO LOCATE AND ATTRACT A SUITABLE ACQUISITION.


is highly speculative. The success of our plan of operation will depend to a great extent on the operations
 financial condition
and management of the identified business opportunity. While management intends to seek business combination(s) with entities having
established operating histories
 we cannot assure you that we will be successful in locating candidates meeting that criterion.
In the event we complete a business combination
 the success of our operations may be dependent upon management of the successor
firm or venture partner firm and numerous other factors beyond our control.

 a private or public entity. No assurances can be given
that we will successfully identify and evaluate suitable business opportunities or that we will conclude a business combination.
Management has not identified any particular industry or specific business within an industry for evaluation. We cannot guarantee
that we will be able to negotiate a business combination on favorable terms
 and there is consequently a risk that funds allocated
to the purchase of our shares will not be invested in a company with active business operations.

000
000 shares of our Common Stock. There are currently 86
242
450 authorized but unissued shares
of Common Stock available for issuance. To the extent that additional shares of Common Stock are authorized and issued in connection
with a merger or business combination
 our stockholders could experience significant dilution of their respective ownership interests.
Furthermore
 the issuance of a substantial number of shares of Common Stock may adversely affect prevailing market prices
 if any
for our Common Stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities.

 Ironbound beneficially owned approximately 69% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock. As a result
Ironbound is able to exercise control over matters requiring stockholder approval
 including the election of directors

the approval of mergers

WHICH MAY RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF STOCKHOLDERS TO SELL OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE SECONDARY MARKET.


Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) has adopted regulations which generally define &quot;penny stock&quot; to be an equity security
that has a market price
 as defined
 of less than $5.00 per share
 or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share
 subject to
certain exceptions
 including an exception of an equity security that is quoted on a national securities exchange. Our Common Stock
is not now quoted on a national securities exchange and has a market price of less than $5.00 per share and therefore may be deemed
to be a penny stock. As such
 they are subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who
sell these securities. For example
 the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser of such securities
and have received the purchaser's written consent to the transactions prior to the purchase. Additionally
 the rules require the
delivery
 prior to the transaction
 of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer
also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered underwriter
 and current quotations for
the securities
 and
 if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker
 the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer's
presumed control over the market. Finally
 among other requirements
 monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information
for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. The &quot;penny stock&quot; rules
may restrict the ability of our stockholders to sell our Common Stock and warrants in the secondary market.

 which provide significantly less liquidity than a national securities
exchange such as the NYSE or the NASDAQ. There is uncertainty that we will ever be accepted for a listing on a national securities
exchange. The purchasers of shares of our Common Stock may find it difficult to resell their shares at prices quoted in the market
or at all.

MANAGEMENT&rsquo;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.





limited operations and have very limited revenues from our business operations since our incorporation in September 2005. Until
December 31
 2007
 we held the exclusive license to exploit the Dreesen's Donut Brand in the United States with the exception of
the states of Florida and Pennsylvania
 and in Suffolk County
 New York
 which Dreesen retained for itself. The license from Dreesen
expired on December 31
 2007.


we discontinued our efforts to promote the Dreesen's Donut Brand
 we have no employees and our main purpose has been to effect
a business combination with an operating business which we believe has significant growth potential. As of yet
 we have no definitive
agreements or understandings with any prospective business combination candidates and there are no assurances that we will find
a suitable business with which to combine. The implementation of our business objectives is wholly contingent upon a business combination
and/or the successful sale of our securities. We intend to utilize the proceeds of any offering
 any sales of equity securities
or debt securities
 bank and other borrowings or a combination of those sources to effect a business combination with a target
business which we believe has significant growth potential. While we may
 under certain circumstances
 seek to effect business
combinations with more than one target business
 unless and until additional financing is obtained
 we will not have sufficient
proceeds remaining after an initial business combination to undertake additional business combinations.


    
    



company to enter into a merger with us is the desire to establish a public trading market for its shares. Such a company would
hope to avoid the perceived adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself
 such as the time delays and significant
expenses incurred to comply with the various Federal and state securities law that regulate initial public offerings.


resources
 we expect to effect only a single business combination. Accordingly
 the prospects for our success will likely be dependent
upon the future performance of a single business. Unlike certain entities that have the resources to consummate several business
combinations or entities operating in multiple industries or multiple segments of a single industry
 we do not expect the resources
to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. A target business may be dependent
upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products
 processes or services
 in which case there
will be an even higher risk that the target business will not prove to be commercially viable.


to devote a small portion of their time (less than 10%) to our affairs on a part-time or as-needed basis. We expect to use outside
consultants
 advisors
 attorneys and accountants as necessary. We do not anticipate hiring any full-time employees so long as we
are seeking and evaluating business opportunities.


to play no managerial role in our company following a business combination. Although we intend to scrutinize closely the management
of a prospective target business in connection with our evaluation of a business combination with a target business
 our assessment
of management may be incorrect. We cannot assure you that we will find a suitable business with which to combine.


objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with
an operating business. We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business
 industry or geographical
location and
 thus
 may acquire any type of business. The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under
the supervision of our officers and directors.




 2016
 we
had no operating business
 no equipment
 and no employees. We do not intend to develop our own operating business but instead plan
to consummate a business combination transaction with an operating company.

 we do not expect

engage in any public or private sales of our equity or debt securities to raise working capital. We are dependent upon future loans
or capital contributions from our present stockholders and/or management and there can be no assurances that our present stockholders
or management will make any loans or capital contributions to us.

statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements.


policies below as some of the more critical to our business and the understanding of our financial position and results of operations.&nbsp;
These policies may involve a high degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting
policies used in the preparation of our financial statements. Although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate and
correct
 actual future results may differ from estimates. If different assumptions or conditions were to prevail
 the results could
be materially different from these reported results. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business
operations are discussed throughout this Report where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results.


financial statements
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
 requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
 liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. These estimates have
a material impact on our financial statements and are discussed in detail throughout this Report.


of preparing our financial statements
 we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
This process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing
treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities
 which are
included within the balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future
taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely
 we must establish a valuation allowance. In the event
that we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount
 an adjustment
to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made.


    
    



option grants under the provisions of the accounting guidance for Share-Based Payments. Such guidance requires the recognition
of the fair value of share-based compensation in the statements of operations. The fair value of our stock option awards was estimated
using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and elections in adopting
and implementing this guidance
 including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. The fair value
of share-based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award and we have elected to use the straight-line method for
awards granted after the adoption of this guidance.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING
AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.








(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures


 with the
participation of our president and chief financial officer
 carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our &ldquo;disclosure
controls and procedures&rdquo; (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15-d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered
by this Report (the &ldquo;Evaluation Date&rdquo;). Based upon that evaluation
 the president and chief financial officer concluded
that as of the Evaluation Date
 our disclosure controls and procedures are effective&nbsp;to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC&rsquo;s rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management
including our&nbsp;president&nbsp;and chief financial officer
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.


 including
our president and chief financial officer
 does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls
will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system
 no matter how well conceived and operated
 can provide only reasonable
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further
 the design of a control system must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems
 management&rsquo;s evaluation of controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
 within Newtown Lane have been detected.

Management's Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting


for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange
Act). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31
 2016. In making
this assessment
 our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
 which was adopted by COSO in 1992. Our management has concluded that
 as of March
31
 2016
 our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria.

 INCORPORATED


 2016 and 2015




 Incorporated&nbsp;(&ldquo;we&rdquo;
&ldquo;our&rdquo;
 &ldquo;us&rdquo; or&nbsp;&ldquo;Newtown&rdquo;) was incorporated in Delaware on September 26
 2005. We previously
held the exclusive license to exploit the Dreesen's Donut Brand in the United States with the exception of the states of Florida
and Pennsylvania
 and in Suffolk County
 New York
 which Dreesen retained for itself. In August 2007 there was a change in control
as detailed below
 and we discontinued our efforts to promote the Dreesen's Donut Brand at that time. The license from Dreesen
expired on December 31
 2007.




 2007 (the &ldquo;Effective Date&rdquo;)
we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the &ldquo;Purchase Agreement&rdquo;) with Moyo Partners
 LLC
 a New York limited liability
company (&ldquo;Moyo&rdquo;) and R&amp;R Biotech Partners
 LLC
 a Delaware limited liability company (&ldquo;R&amp;R&rdquo; collectively
with Moyo
 the &ldquo;Purchasers&rdquo;)
 pursuant to which we sold to them
 in the aggregate
 approximately
 four million four
hundred seventy nine thousand two hundred fifty (4
479
250) shares of our common stock
 par value $.001 per share (&ldquo;Common
of our Series A Preferred Stock
 par value $.001
per share (&ldquo;Series A Preferred Stock&rdquo;)
 each share convertible at the option of the holder into
 approximately
 fourteen
thousand eight hundred twenty (14
820) shares of Common Stock
proceeds to us of $600
000. The
shares of Series A Preferred Stock were convertible only to the extent there were a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock
available for issuance upon any such conversion.


control of Newtown
 with (a) R&amp;R acquiring nine million five hundred nine thousand four hundred forty (9
509
440) shares of
Common Stock (assuming the conversion by R&amp;R of the four hundred (400) shares of Series A Preferred Stock it acquired pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement into five million nine hundred twenty eight thousand (5
928
000) shares of Common Stock) constituting
72% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock
 and (b) Moyo acquiring two million three hundred seventy seven thousand
three hundred sixty (2
377
360) shares of Common Stock (assuming the conversion by Moyo of its one hundred (100) shares of Series
A Preferred Stock it acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement into one million four hundred eighty one thousand five hundred
ten (1
481
510) shares of Common Stock) constituting 18% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock; and (ii) in
full satisfaction of our obligations under outstanding convertible promissory notes in the principal amount of $960
000 (the &ldquo;December
Notes&rdquo;)
 the Note holders of the December Notes converted an aggregate of $479
811 of principal and accrued interest into
274
200 shares of Common Stock and accepted a cash payment from us in the aggregate amount of $625
030 for the remaining principal
balance.


was appointed to our Board of Directors (&ldquo;Board&rdquo;) and served together with Vincent J. McGill
 a then current director
who continued to serve until August 20
 2007
 the effective date of his resignation from our Board; (ii) all of our then officers
and directors
 with the exception of Mr. McGill
 resigned from their respective positions with us; (iii) our Board appointed Mr.
Kling as president and Kirk M. Warshaw as chief financial officer and secretary; and (iv) we relocated our headquarters to Chatham
New Jersey.


our Board on August 20
 2007
 Mr. Kling became our sole director and president.


 2007
 we effected an amendment
to our Certificate of Incorporation to increase to 100
000
000 the number of authorized shares of Common Stock available for issuance
(the &ldquo;Charter Amendment&rdquo;). As a result of the Charter Amendment
 as of October 19
 2007
 we had adequate shares of
Common Stock available for issuance upon the conversion of all the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock.


    
    



 2007
 the holders of all the
issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock elected to convert all of their shares into shares of Common Stock. As
a result
 the 500 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding were exchanged for 7
407
540 shares of Common Stock
 and all 500
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock were returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares of undesignated preferred
stock
 par value $.001 per shares. None of the Series A Preferred Stock were outstanding as of the Series A Preferred Elimination
Date.


 we sold 550
000 shares of
restricted Common Stock to our Chief Financial Officer
 for $2
000. The issuance of these shares was exempt from registration pursuant
to Sections 4(2) and 4(6) or the Securities Act of 1933
 as amended (the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;). The stock certificate representing
these shares was imprinted with a legend restricting transfer unless pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption
from registration under the Act.


 2013
 Ironbound Partners Fund
 LLC
(&ldquo;Ironbound&rdquo;) acquired 9
509
440 shares of our outstanding Common Stock (the &ldquo;Acquired Shares&rdquo;) for an
aggregate purchase price of $15
000
 or $0.00157737 per share
 from the Chapter 7 Trustee of the Estates of Rodman &amp; Renshaw
LLC (&ldquo;Rodman&rdquo;)
 Direct Markets
 Inc.
 and Direct Markets Holdings
 Corp. in Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings pending
in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Cases No. 13-10087
 13-10088 and 13-10089). The Acquired
Shares constituted all the shares of Common Stock previously owned by R&amp;R
 an affiliate of Rodman
 and represented 69.1% of
our total issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of May 6
 2013.


 2013
 Ironbound loaned $100
000
to us and we issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $100
000 to Ironbound (the &ldquo;May 2013 Note&rdquo;).
The May 2013 Note was initially issued with a two-year term and bore interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum
 payable at maturity.
The principal and accrued interest on the May 2013 Note was convertible into shares of Common Stock upon the consummation of a
&ldquo;Fundamental Transaction&rdquo; (as defined in the May 2013 Note) at the &ldquo;Conversion Price&rdquo; (as defined in the
May 2013 Note). The May 2013 Note was amended in July 2014 in accordance with the Amended and Restated Note
 as described below.


 2014
 we raised gross proceeds
of $72
000 in a debt financing transaction with Ironbound and
 in connection therewith
 issued to Ironbound a convertible promissory
note (the &ldquo;2014 Note&rdquo;) in the principal amount of $72
000. The 2014 Note has a maturity date of August 31
 2015 and
bears interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum
 payable at maturity. The principal and accrued interest on the 2014 Note is convertible
at the election of Ironbound
 into shares of our Common Stock following the consummation of a &ldquo;Qualified Financing&rdquo;
(as defined in the 2014 Note)
 or upon the consummation of a &ldquo;Fundamental Transaction&rdquo; (as defined in the 2014 Note)
at the &ldquo;Conversion Price&rdquo; (as defined in the 2014 Note).


 on July 25
 2014
 we issued an amended
and restated convertible promissory note (the &ldquo;Amended and Restated Note&rdquo; and together with the 2014 Note
 the &ldquo;Prior
Notes&rdquo;) to Ironbound in the principal amount of $100
000
 in substitution for the May 2013 Note. The Amended and Restated
Note extended the maturity of the May 2013 Note to August 31
 2015 and provided for the principal and accrued interest on the May
2013 Note to be convertible
 at the election of Ironbound
 into shares of our Common Stock following the consummation of a &ldquo;Qualified
Financing&rdquo; (as defined in the May 2013 Note)
 or upon the consummation of a &ldquo;Fundamental Transaction&rdquo; (as defined
in the May 2013 Note) at the &ldquo;Conversion Price&rdquo; (as defined in the May 2013 Note). The May 2013 Note otherwise remained
unchanged.


 2015
 the maturity dates
of the Prior Notes was extended from August 31
 2015 to August 31
 2016.


 2015
 Mr. Kling resigned from
his position as our sole director and from his position as our President. Also on October 30
 2015
 Mr. Warshaw resigned from his
positions as our Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. Messrs. Kling&rsquo;s and Warshaw&rsquo;s resignation were not due to any
disagreement with the Company or its management on any matter relating to the Company&rsquo;s operations
 policies or practices.
Prior to Mr. Kling&rsquo;s resignation
 our Board of Directors appointed Jonathan J. Ledecky
 the managing member of Ironbound
our largest stockholder
 to fill the vacancy created by Mr. Kling&rsquo;s resignation and will assume the role of President of
the Company.


    
    



 2016
 we issued a convertible promissory
note (the &ldquo;2016 Note&rdquo; and together with the Prior Notes
 the &ldquo;Outstanding Notes&rdquo;) in the principal amount
of $10
000 to Ironbound. The 2016 Note has the same terms as the Prior Notes. The proceeds of the 2016 Note was and will be utilized
by the Company to fund working capital needs.




 our main purpose
has been to serve as a vehicle to acquire an operating business and we are currently considered a &ldquo;shell&rdquo; company in
as much as we are not generating revenues
 do not own an operating business
 and have no specific plan other than to engage in
a merger or acquisition transaction with a yet-to-be identified operating company or business. Our principal business objective
for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with an operating
company or business. We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business
 industry or geographical
location and
 thus
 may acquire any type of business. The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under
the supervision of our officers and directors. We have no employees and no material assets.


POLICIES


policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Outlined below are those
policies considered particularly significant.




have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
 which contemplates
Newtown continuing as a going concern. Our purpose has been to serve as a vehicle to acquire an operating business and we are currently
considered a &ldquo;shell&rdquo; company inasmuch as we are not generating revenues
 we do own an operating business
 and have
no specific plan other than to engage in a merger or acquisition transaction with a yet-to-be-identified operating company or business.
We currently have no definitive agreements or understandings with any prospective business combination candidates and there no
assurances that we find a suitable business with which to combine. The implementation of our business objectives is wholly contingent
upon a business combination and/or the successful sale of our securities. We intend to utilize the proceeds of any offering
 any
sales of equity securities or debt securities
 bank and other borrowings or a combination of those sources to effect a business
combination with a target business which we believe may have significant growth potential. While we may
 under certain circumstances
seek to effect business combinations with more than one target business
 unless additional financing is obtained
 we will not have
sufficient proceeds remaining after an initial business combination to undertake additional business combinations. There is no
assurance that these plans will be realized in whole or in part. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of these uncertainties.


 Newtown has incurred
an accumulated deficit of $2
266
757 through March 31
 2016. For the years ended March 31
 2016 and 2015
 Newtown had net losses
of $52
207 and $80
143
 respectively. Newtown has incurred negative cash flow from operating activities since its inception. Newtown
has spent
 and subject to obtaining additional funding
 expects to continue to spend substantial amounts in connection with executing
its business strategy. These conditions raise substantial doubt about Newtown&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern.




with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
 management makes certain estimates and assumptions
where applicable
 that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements
as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While
actual results could differ from those estimates
 management does not expect such variances
 if any
 to have a material effect
on the financial statements.


    
    





cash flows Newtown considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.




Board (FASB) has issued accounting guidance &ldquo;Earnings Per Share&rdquo; that provides for the calculation of &ldquo;Basic&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Diluted&rdquo; earnings per share. Basic earnings per share include no dilution and is computed by dividing the loss
to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. All potentially dilutive securities
have been excluded from the computations since they would be antidilutive. However
 these dilutive securities could potentially
dilute earnings per share in the future. As of March 31
 2016
 we had a total of 886
990 of potentially dilutive securities comprised
solely of stock options.




used in accounting for income taxes. Under this method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations
in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax
assets unless it I more likely than not that such assets will be realized.




reported assets and liabilities which represent financial instruments
 none of which are held for trading purposes
 approximate
their carrying values because of the short term maturity of these instruments or the stated interest rates are indicative of market
interest rates.




for share based payment transactions. This standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for
equity share options granted based on the grant date fair value of the options and applies to all outstanding and vested stock-based
awards.


 the fair
value of each option is estimated on the date of grant based on the Black-Scholes options-pricing model utilizing certain assumptions
for a risk free interest rate; volatility and expected remaining lives of the awards. The assumptions used in calculating the fair
value of share-based payment awards represent management&rsquo;s bet estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application
of management judgment. As a result
 if factors change and we use different assumptions
 our stock-based compensation expense could
be materially different in the future. In addition
 we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize
expense for those shares expected to vest. In estimating our forfeiture rate
 we analyzed our historical forfeiture rate
 the remaining
lives of unvested options
 and the amount of vested option as a percentage of total options outstanding. If our actual forfeiture
rate is materially different from its estimate
 or if we reevaluate the forfeiture rate in the future
 the stock-based compensation
expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.


compensation expense over the vesting period of the options. The compensation cost included in operating expenses was $0 and
$3
661 for the year ended March 31
 2016 and 2015
 respectively. No tax benefit was recorded as of March 31
 2015 in
connection with these compensation costs due to the uncertainty regarding ultimate realization of certain net operating loss
carry forwards.

 management
does not believe that any other new accounting pronouncements not yet effective will have a material impact on our financial statements
once adopted.


 the FASB issued
accounting Standards Update &ldquo;ASU&rdquo; 2014-15 on &ldquo;Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)
&ndash; Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&rsquo;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&rdquo;. Currently
 there is
no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management&rsquo;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&rsquo;s
ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance.
In doing so
 the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments
require management to assess an entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain
principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards.


 the amendments (1)
provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods
(3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management&rsquo;s plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when
substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&rsquo;s plans
 (5) require an express statement and
other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date
that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this update are effective for public and
nonpublic entities for annual periods ending after December 15
 2016. Early adoption is permitted.

shares of Common Stock) constituting 18% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock; and (ii) in full satisfaction
of our obligations under the December Notes
 the holders of the December Notes converted an aggregate of $479
811 of principal
and accrued interest into 274
200 shares of Common Stock and accepted a cash payment from us in the aggregate amount of $625
030

 2007
 we put into effect an
amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to increase to 100
000
000 the number of authorized shares of Common Stock available
for issuance (the &ldquo;Charter Amendment&rdquo;). As a result of the Charter Amendment
 as of October 19
 2007
 we had adequate
shares of Common Stock available for issuance upon the conversion of all the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
Stock.


 2007
 the holders of all the
issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock elected to convert all of their shares into shares of Common Stock. As
a result
 the 500 shares of series A Preferred Stock outstanding were exchanged for 7
407
540 shares of Common Stock
 and all 500
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock were returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares of undersigned preferred stock
par value $.001 per share.


 2008
 we implemented a 1 for
50 reverse stock split (the &ldquo;Reverse Split&rdquo;) of the Common Stock. Pursuant to the Reverse Split
 each 50 shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding was converted into one share of Common Stock.


 we sold 550
000 shares of
Common Stock to Kirk Warshaw
 CFO
 for $2
000. We determined such shares were issued below their fair value; hence
 $11
750 of
compensation expense was recorded for the difference in value of the shares issued for cash versus fair value of such shares.

 Ironbound Partners Fund
 LLC
(&ldquo;Ironbound&rdquo;) acquired 9
509
440 shares of Common Stock (the &ldquo;Acquired Shares&rdquo;) for an aggregate purchase
price of $15
000
 or $0.00157737 per share. The Acquired Shares represent 69.1% of our total issued and outstanding shares of Common
Stock. The Acquired Shares were purchased by Ironbound
 utilizing its available and uncommitted cash
 from the Chapter 7 Trustee
of the Estates of Rodman &amp; Renshaw
 LLC (&ldquo;Rodman&rdquo;)
 Direct Markets
 Inc. and /Direct Markets Holding
 Corp. in
Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Cases No.
13-10087
 13-10088 and 13-10089). The Acquired Shares constitute all the shares of Common Stock previously owned by R&amp;R
 an
affiliate of Rodman.


 2013
 we declared a stock dividend
on our outstanding Common Stock for stockholders of record as of August 15
 2013 (the &ldquo;Record Date&rdquo;). As a result
all stockholders on the Record Date received nine new shares of Common Stock for each share of Common Stock owned by them as of
that date (the &ldquo;2013 Stock Dividend&rdquo;). All share and per share data herein has been retroactively restated to reflect
the Reverse Split and the 2013 Stock Dividend
 since the 2013 Stock Dividend was in substance a forward stock split.

 Ironbound loaned $100

000 to Ironbound (the May 2013 &ldquo;Note&rdquo;).
The May 2013 Note was initially issued with a two-year term and bore interest at a rate of 5.0% per annum
 payable at maturity.
The principal and accrued interest on the May 2013 Note was convertible into shares of Common Stock upon the consummation of a
&ldquo;Fundamental Transaction&rdquo; (as defined in the May 2013 Note) at the &ldquo;Conversion Price&rdquo; (as defined in the

000. The 2014 Note has a maturity date of August 31

 we issued an amended
and restated convertible promissory note (the &ldquo;Amended and Restated Note&rdquo; and together with the 2014 Note
 the &ldquo;Prior
Notes&rdquo;) to Ironbound in the principal amount of $100
000
 in substitution for the May 2013 Note. The Amended and Restated
Note extended the maturity of the May 2013 Note to August 31
 2015 and provided for the principal and accrued interest on the May
2013 Note to be convertible
 at the election of Ironbound
 into shares of our Common Stock following the consummation of a &ldquo;Qualified
Financing&rdquo; (as defined in the May 2013 Note)

our largest stockholder

in various years beginning in 2030. In addition

 which is fully reserved as well. This
capital loss expires in 2026. The deferred tax asset and related valuation increased by approximately $ during the period ended

 our main purpose has been to serve as a vehicle to acquire an operating business and we are currently considered a &amp;#8220;shell&amp;#8221; company in as much as we are not generating revenues
 do not own an operating business
 and have no specific plan other than to engage in a merger or acquisition transaction with a yet-to-be identified operating company or business. Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with an operating company or business. We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business
 industry or geographical location and
 thus


 which contemplates Newtown continuing as a going concern. Our purpose has been to serve as a vehicle to acquire an operating business and we are currently considered a &amp;#8220;shell&amp;#8221; company inasmuch as we are not generating revenues
 we do own an operating business
 and have no specific plan other than to engage in a merger or acquisition transaction with a yet-to-be-identified operating company or business. We currently have no definitive agreements or understandings with any prospective business combination candidates and there no assurances that we find a suitable business with which to combine. The implementation of our business objectives is wholly contingent upon a business combination and/or the successful sale of our securities. We intend to utilize the proceeds of any offering
 any sales of equity securities or debt securities
 bank and other borrowings or a combination of those sources to effect a business combination with a target business which we believe may have significant growth potential. While we may
 under certain circumstances
 seek to effect business combinations with more than one target business
 unless additional financing is obtained

 management makes certain estimates and assumptions
 where applicable
 that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While actual results could differ from those estimates
 management does not expect such variances
 if any

 these dilutive securities could potentially dilute earnings per share in the future. As of March 31
 2016
 we had a total of &lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt; 886


 none of which are held for trading purposes

 the fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant based on the Black-Scholes options-pricing model utilizing certain assumptions for a risk free interest rate; volatility and expected remaining lives of the awards. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management&amp;#8217;s bet estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result
 if factors change and we use different assumptions
 our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition
 we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. In estimating our forfeiture rate
 we analyzed our historical forfeiture rate
 the remaining lives of unvested options
 and the amount of vested option as a percentage of total options outstanding. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate
 or if we reevaluate the forfeiture rate in the future

661&lt;/font&gt; for the year ended March 31

 there is no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management&amp;#8217;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so

 the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management&amp;#8217;s plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&amp;#8217;s plans
 (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this update are effective for public and nonpublic entities for annual periods ending after December 15

The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management&amp;#8217;s bet estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result
 if factors change and we use different assumptions
 our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition
 we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. In estimating our forfeiture rate
 we analyzed our historical forfeiture rate
 the remaining lives of unvested options
 and the amount of vested option as a percentage of total options outstanding. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate
 or if we reevaluate the forfeiture rate in the future

 the FASB issued accounting Standards Update &amp;#8220;ASU&amp;#8221; 2014-15 on &amp;#8220;Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) &amp;#150; Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&amp;#8217;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&amp;#8221;. Currently
 there is no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management&amp;#8217;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so

 the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management&amp;#8217;s plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&amp;#8217;s plans
 (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this update are effective for public and nonpublic entities for annual periods ending after December 15

 Ironbound loaned $&lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;100
000&lt;/font&gt; to us and we issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $&lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;100
000&lt;/font&gt; to Ironbound (the May 2013 &amp;#8220;Note&amp;#8221;). The May 2013 Note was initially issued with a two-year term and bore interest at a rate of &lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt; 5.0&lt;/font&gt;% per annum
 payable at maturity. The principal and accrued interest on the May 2013 Note was convertible into shares of Common Stock upon the consummation of a &amp;#8220;Fundamental Transaction&amp;#8221; (as defined in the May 2013 Note) at the &amp;#8220;Conversion Price&amp;#8221; (as defined in the May 2013 Note). The May 2013 Note was amended in July 2014 in accordance with the amended and Restated Note

 2014
 we raised gross proceeds of $&lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;72
000&lt;/font&gt; in a debt financing transaction with Ironbound and
 in connection therewith
 issued to Ironbound a convertible promissory note (the &amp;#8220;2014 Note&amp;#8221;) in the principal amount of $&lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;72

 into shares of our common stock following the consummation of a &amp;#8220;Qualified Financing&amp;#8221; (as defined in the 2014 Note)

 on July 25
 2014
 we issued an amended and restated convertible promissory note (the &amp;#8220;Amended and Restated Note&amp;#8221; and together with the 2014 Note
 the &amp;#8220;Prior Notes&amp;#8221;) to Ironbound in the principal amount of $&lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;100
000&lt;/font&gt;
 in substitution for the May 2013 Note. The Amended and Restated Note extended the maturity of the May 2013 Note to August 31
 2015 and provided for the principal and accrued interest on the May 2013 Note to be convertible
 at the election of Ironbound

 Mr. Kling resigned from his position as our sole director and from his position as our President. Also on October 30
 2015
 Mr. Warshaw resigned from his positions as our Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. Messrs. Kling&amp;#8217;s and Warshaw&amp;#8217;s resignation were not due to any disagreement with the Company or its management on any matter relating to the Company&amp;#8217;s operations
 policies or practices. Prior to Mr. Kling&amp;#8217;s resignation

 Newtown had approximately $&lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;1
863
000&lt;/font&gt; of net operating loss carry forwards (&amp;#8220;NOL&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8221;) available which expires in various years beginning in &lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt; 2030&lt;/font&gt;. In addition
 there is a $&lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;25
000&lt;/font&gt; capital loss carryover
 which is fully reserved as well. This capital loss expires in &lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt; 2026&lt;/font&gt;. The deferred tax asset and related valuation increased by approximately $ during the period ended March 31






  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

 which contemplates Newtown continuing as a going concern. Our purpose has been to serve as a vehicle to acquire an operating business and we are currently considered a &amp;#8220;shell&amp;#8221; company inasmuch as we are not generating revenues
 we do own an operating business
 and have no specific plan other than to engage in a merger or acquisition transaction with a yet-to-be-identified operating company or business. We currently have no definitive agreements or understandings with any prospective business combination candidates and there no assurances that we find a suitable business with which to combine. The implementation of our business objectives is wholly contingent upon a business combination and/or the successful sale of our securities. We intend to utilize the proceeds of any offering
 any sales of equity securities or debt securities
 bank and other borrowings or a combination of those sources to effect a business combination with a target business which we believe may have significant growth potential. While we may
 under certain circumstances
 seek to effect business combinations with more than one target business
 unless additional financing is obtained

 Newtown has incurred an accumulated deficit of $&lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;2
266
757&lt;/font&gt; through March 31
 2016. For the years ended March 31
 2016 and 2015
 Newtown had net losses of $&lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;52
207&lt;/font&gt; and $&lt;font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&gt;80
143&lt;/font&gt;
 respectively. Newtown has incurred negative cash flow from operating activities since its inception. Newtown has spent

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
 which contemplates Newtown continuing as a going concern. Our purpose has been to serve as a vehicle to acquire an operating business and we are currently considered a &#8220;shell&#8221; company inasmuch as we are not generating revenues
 we do own an operating business
 and have no specific plan other than to engage in a merger or acquisition transaction with a yet-to-be-identified operating company or business. We currently have no definitive agreements or understandings with any prospective business combination candidates and there no assurances that we find a suitable business with which to combine. The implementation of our business objectives is wholly contingent upon a business combination and/or the successful sale of our securities. We intend to utilize the proceeds of any offering
 any sales of equity securities or debt securities
 bank and other borrowings or a combination of those sources to effect a business combination with a target business which we believe may have significant growth potential. While we may
 under certain circumstances
 seek to effect business combinations with more than one target business

In preparing financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
 management makes certain estimates and assumptions
 where applicable
 that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While actual results could differ from those estimates
 management does not expect such variances
 if any
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued accounting guidance &#8220;Earnings Per Share&#8221; that provides for the calculation of &#8220;Basic&#8221; and &#8220;Diluted&#8221; earnings per share. Basic earnings per share include no dilution and is computed by dividing the loss to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. All potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computations since they would be antidilutive. However
 these dilutive securities could potentially dilute earnings per share in the future. As of March 31
 2016

The asset and liability method is used in accounting for income taxes. Under this method
The estimated fair values of all reported assets and liabilities which represent financial instruments
 none of which are held for trading purposes
In computing the impact
 the fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant based on the Black-Scholes options-pricing model utilizing certain assumptions for a risk free interest rate; volatility and expected remaining lives of the awards. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management&#8217;s bet estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result
 if factors change and we use different assumptions
 our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition
 we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. In estimating our forfeiture rate
 we analyzed our historical forfeiture rate
 the remaining lives of unvested options
 and the amount of vested option as a percentage of total options outstanding. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate
 or if we reevaluate the forfeiture rate in the future

 the FASB issued accounting Standards Update &#8220;ASU&#8221; 2014-15 on &#8220;Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) &#150; Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&#8217;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&#8221;. Currently
 there is no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management&#8217;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so
Specifically
 the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management&#8217;s plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&#8217;s plans
 (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this update are effective for public and nonpublic entities for annual periods ending after December 15
 2016. Early adoption is permitted.

 respectively. Newtown has incurred negative cash flow from operating activities since its inception. Newtown has spent
 and subject to obtaining additional funding
 expects to continue to spend substantial amounts in connection with executing its business strategy. These conditions raise substantial doubt about Newtown&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern.



Use of Estimates
 Policy [Policy Text Block]
In preparing financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
 management makes certain estimates and assumptions
 where applicable
 that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While actual results could differ from those estimates
 management does not expect such variances

 to have a material effect on the financial statements.








Earnings Per Share
 Policy [Policy Text Block]
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued accounting guidance &#8220;Earnings Per Share&#8221; that provides for the calculation of &#8220;Basic&#8221; and &#8220;Diluted&#8221; earnings per share. Basic earnings per share include no dilution and is computed by dividing the loss to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. All potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computations since they would be antidilutive. However
 these dilutive securities could potentially dilute earnings per share in the future. As of March 31
 2016

Income Tax
 Policy [Policy Text Block]
The asset and liability method is used in accounting for income taxes. Under this method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it I more likely than not that such assets will be realized.



Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The estimated fair values of all reported assets and liabilities which represent financial instruments
 none of which are held for trading purposes
 approximate their carrying values because of the short term maturity of these instruments or the stated interest rates are indicative of market interest rates.



Share-based Compensation
 Option and Incentive Plans Policy [Policy Text Block]
In computing the impact
 the fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant based on the Black-Scholes options-pricing model utilizing certain assumptions for a risk free interest rate; volatility and expected remaining lives of the awards. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management&#8217;s bet estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result
 if factors change and we use different assumptions
 our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition
 we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. In estimating our forfeiture rate
 we analyzed our historical forfeiture rate
 the remaining lives of unvested options
 and the amount of vested option as a percentage of total options outstanding. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate
 or if we reevaluate the forfeiture rate in the future

New Accounting Pronouncements
 Policy [Policy Text Block]
Except as set forth below
In August 2014
 the FASB issued accounting Standards Update &#8220;ASU&#8221; 2014-15 on &#8220;Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) &#150; Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&#8217;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&#8221;. Currently
 there is no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management&#8217;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so
Specifically
 the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management&#8217;s plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&#8217;s plans
 (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this update are effective for public and nonpublic entities for annual periods ending after December 15
 2016. Early adoption is permitted.
