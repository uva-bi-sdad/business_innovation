1. Business.


Business
Overview

Barfresh
is a leader in the creation
 manufacturing and distribution of ready to blend frozen beverages. The current portfolio of products
includes smoothies
 shakes and frappes. Products are packaged in two distinct formats.

The
Company&rsquo;s original single serve format features portion controlled and ready to blend beverage ingredient packs or &ldquo;beverage
packs&rdquo;. The beverage packs contain all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage
 including the base (either
sorbet
 frozen yogurt or ice cream)
 real fruit pieces
 juices and ice &ndash; five ounces of water are added before blending.

The
Company&rsquo;s bulk &ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo; format also contains all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage
packaged in gallon containers in a concentrated formula that is mixed &ldquo;one to one&rdquo; with water. The Company has a &ldquo;no
sugar added&rdquo; version of the bulk &ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo; format that is specifically targeted for the USDA national school
meal program
 including the School Breakfast Program
 the National School Lunch Program
 and Smart Snacks in Schools Program.
The Company is currently in contract to sell its bulk Easy Pour products into over three hundred schools. In addition
 the Company
received approval from the United States Defense Logistics Agency (&ldquo;DLA&rdquo;) to sell its smoothie products into all branches
of the U.S. Armed Forces
 and is currently in contract with and selling its bulk Easy Pour products into over one hundred military
bases in the United States.

Domestic
and international patents and patents pending are owned by Barfresh
 as well as related trademarks for all of the single serve
products. Patent rights have been granted in 13 jurisdictions including the United States. In addition
 the Company has purchased
all of the trademarks related to the patented products.

The
Company conducts sales through several channels
 including National Accounts
 Regional Accounts
 and Broadline Distributors. Barfresh&rsquo;s
primary broadline distribution arrangement is through an exclusive nationwide agreement with Sysco Corporation (&ldquo;Sysco&rdquo;)
the U.S.&rsquo;s largest broadline distributor
 which was entered into during July 2014.



Pursuant
to that agreement
 all Barfresh products are included in Sysco&rsquo;s national core selection of beverage items
 making Barfresh
its exclusive single-serve
 pre-portioned beverage provider. The agreement is mutually exclusive; however
 Barfresh may also sell
the products to other foodservice distributors
 but only to the extent required for such foodservice distributors to service multi-unit
chain operators with at least 20 units and where Sysco is not such multi- unit chain operator&rsquo;s nominated distributor for
our products. On October 2
 2017
 the Sysco agreement was extended for an additional two year period
 and expanded to cover bulk
easy pour products
 on a non-exclusive basis.

During
2016 and 2017 the Company announced that it had signed supply agreements with several of the major global on-site foodservice
operators. On March 8
 2018
 the Company announced that it had signed a new supply agreement with one of the largest of these
foodservice operators
 for exclusive distribution of four of Barfresh&rsquo;s single serve sku&rsquo;s. On November 14
 2018
the Company announced that it had received approval for multiple products to be rolled out to a national restaurant chain with
over 2
500 locations.


On
October 26
 2015
 Barfresh signed a five year agreement with PepsiCo North America Beverages
 a division of PepsiCo
 to become
its exclusive sales representative within the food service channel to present Barfresh&rsquo;s line of ready-to-blend smoothies
and frozen beverages throughout the United States and Canada. Through this agreement
 Barfresh&rsquo; products are included as
part of PepsiCo&rsquo;s offerings to its significant customer base. The agreement facilitates access to potential National customer
accounts
 through introductions provided by PepsiCo&rsquo;s one-thousand plus person foodservice sales team. Barfresh products
have become part of PepsiCo&rsquo;s customer presentations at national trade shows and similar venues.

Barfresh
utilizes contract manufacturers to manufacture all of its products in the United States. Production lines are currently operational
at two locations. The first location is in Salt Lake City
 which currently produces both bulk easy pour and single serve products.
Annual production capacity with this contract manufacturer is 14 million units per year. The second location is with Yarnell Operations
LLC.
 a subsidiary of Shulze and Burch
 located in Arkansas. The Yarnell&rsquo;s agreement
 which was signed during February
2016
 and secures the capacity to ramp up to an incremental production capacity of 100 million units. Yarnell&rsquo;s location
enhances the company&rsquo;s ability to efficiently move product throughout the supply chain to destinations in the eastern United
States
 home to many of the country&rsquo;s large foodservice outlets.

Our
corporate office is located at 3600 Wilshire Boulevard Suite 1720

Reorganization
and Recapitalization

During
January
 2012
 the Company entered into a series of transactions pursuant to which Barfresh Inc.
 a Colorado corporation (&ldquo;Barfresh
NV&rdquo;)
 was acquired
 spun-out prior operations to the former principal shareholder
 completed a private offering of securities
for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1
000
000
 conducted a four for one forward stock split and changed the name
of the Company. The following describes the steps of this reorganization:



    
    
Acquisition
    of Barfresh NV. 
333
328
    shares of our $0.000001 par value common stock pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement between us
 our former principal shareholder
    Barfresh NV and the former shareholders of Barfresh NV. As a result of this transaction
 Barfresh NV became our wholly owned
    subsidiary and the former shareholders of Barfresh NV became our controlling shareholders.

    
    
    

    
    
Spinout
    of prior business. 
 we spun-out our previous business operations to
    a former officer
 director and principal shareholder
 in exchange for all of the shares of our common stock held by that person.
    Such shares were cancelled immediately following the acquisition.

    
    
    

    
    
Financing
    transaction
 we sold an aggregate of 1
333
332 shares of our common
    stock and five-year warrants to purchase 1
333
332 shares of common stock at a per share exercise price of $1.50 in a private
    offering for gross proceeds of $999
998
 less expenses of $26
895.

    
    
    

    
    
Change
    of name
 we changed the name of the Company from Moving Box Inc. to Barfresh Food Group Inc.
    Barfresh Food Group Inc.
 has two direct subsidiaries; Barfresh Corporation
 Inc
 (formerly known as Smoothie
 Inc.) and
    Barfresh
 Inc.

    
    
    

    
    
Forward
    stock split
 we conducted a four for one forward stock split of the Company&rsquo;s common stock.




The
Company&rsquo;s products are made in two formats. The first is in portion controlled single serving beverage ingredient packs
suitable for smoothies
 shakes and frappes that can also be utilized for cocktails and mocktails. These packs contain all of the
ingredients necessary to make a smoothie
 shake or frappe
 including the ice. Simply add water
 empty the packet into a blender
blend and serve. The second format is the bulk &ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo; format. The Company&rsquo;s bulk &ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo;
format also contains all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage
 packaged in gallon containers in a concentrated
formula that is mixed &ldquo;one to one&rdquo; with water.

Customer
Marketing Material

A
wide range of consumer marketing materials has been created to assist customers in selling blended beverages.




Research
and Development

The
Company incurred research and development expenses for the year ended December 31
 2018 in the amount of $674
224 and for the
year ended December 31
 2017 in the amount of $574
989. The increase in Research and Development expenses was primarily attributable
to increased activity in creating unique flavors for potential customers in our national account pipeline.


    
    





There
is significant competition in the smoothie market at both the consumer purchasing level and also the product level.

The
competition at the consumer level is primarily between specialized juice bars (e.g. Jamba Juice) and major fast casual and fast
food restaurant chains (such as McDonalds). Barfresh does not compete specifically at this level but intends to supply its product
to customers that fall within these segments to enable them to compete for consumer demand.

There
may also be new entrants to the smoothie market that may alter the current competitor landscape.

The
existing competition from a product perspective can be separated into three categories:

&#9679;
Specialized juice bar products: The product is made in-store and each ingredient is added separately.

&#9679;
Syrup based products: The fruit puree is supplied in bulk and not portion controlled for each smoothie. These types of products
still require the addition of juice
 milk or water and/or yogurt and ice. While there are a number of competitors for this style
of product
 the two dominant competitors are Island Oasis and Minute Maid.

&#9679;
Portion pack products: These products contain only the fruit and yogurt and require the addition of juice or milk and ice. The
dominant competitor is General Mills&rsquo; Yoplait Smoothies.

The
Company believes that its single serve products afford a very significant competitive advantage based on ease of use
 portion
control
 premium quality
 and minimal capital investment required to enable a customer to begin to carry Barfresh beverage products.
The Company also believes that its bulk &ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo; product represents an attractive alternative delivery method for
customers that serve high volume locations
 where speed of service over extended periods is a critical requirement. The Company
has recently launched a &ldquo;no sugar added&rdquo; version of the bulk &ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo; format that is specifically targeted
for the USDA national school meal program
 including the School Breakfast Program
 the National School Lunch Program
 and Smart
Snacks in Schools Program.

Intellectual
Property

Barfresh
owns the domestic and intellectual property rights to its products&rsquo; sealed pack of ingredients used in its single serve
products.

In
November 2011
 the Company acquired patent applications filed in the United States (Patent Application number 11/660415) and Canada
(Patent Application number 2577163) from certain related parties. The United States patent was originally filed on December 4
2007 and it was granted during August of 2017. The Canadian patent was originally filed on August 16
 2005 and it was granted
on May 27
 2014.

On
October 15
 2013
 the Company acquired all of the related international patent rights
 which were filed pursuant to the Patent
Cooperation Treaty
 have been granted in 13 jurisdictions and are pending in the remainder of the jurisdictions that have signed
the PCT. In addition
 the Company purchased all of the trademarks related to the patented products.

Governmental
Approval and Regulation

The
Company is not aware of the need for any governmental approvals of its products.

The
Company utilizes contract manufacturers. Before entering into any manufacturing contracts
 the Company determines that the manufacturer
meets all government requirements.

Environmental
Laws

The
Company does not believe that it will be subject to any environmental laws
 either state or federal. Any laws concerning manufacturing
will be the responsibility of the contract manufacturer.


    
    





The
Company currently has 26 employees and 3 consultants. There are currently 14 employees selling our products.

Item
1A. Risk Factors

An
investment in the Company&rsquo;s securities involves significant risks
 including the risks described below. The risks included
below are not the only ones that the Company faces. Additional risks presently unknown to us or that we currently consider immaterial
or unlikely to occur could also impair our operations. If any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any such additional
risks and uncertainties actually occur
 our business
 prospects
 financial condition or results of operations could be negatively
affected.

Risks
Related to Our Business

We
have a history of operating losses

We
have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability. These operating losses have been generated while
we market to potential customers. We cannot guarantee that we will become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability
 given
the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we operate
 we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability
and our failure to do so would adversely affect the Company&rsquo;s business
 including our ability to raise additional funds.

A
worsening of economic conditions or a decrease in consumer spending may adversely impact our ability to implement our business
strategy.

Our
success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending
 which is influenced by general economic conditions
and the availability of discretionary income. There is no certainty regarding economic conditions in the United States
 and credit
and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions could deteriorate at any time. Accordingly
 we may experience declines
in revenue during economic turmoil or during periods of uncertainty. Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending
leading cost-conscious consumers to be more selective in restaurants visited
 could have a material adverse effect on our revenue
results of operations
 business and financial condition.

The
challenges of competing with the many food services businesses may result in reductions in our revenue and operating margins.

We
compete with many well-established companies
 food service and otherwise
 on the basis of taste
 quality and price of product
offered
 customer service
 atmosphere
 location and overall guest experience. Our success depends
 in part
 upon the popularity
of our products and our ability to develop new menu items that appeal to consumers across all four day parts. Shifts in consumer
preferences away from our products
 our inability to develop new menu items that appeal to consumers across all day parts
 or
changes in our menu that eliminate items popular with some consumers could harm our business. We compete with other smoothie and
juice bar retailers
 specialty coffee retailers
 yogurt and ice cream shops
 bagel shops
 fast-food restaurants
 delicatessens
caf&eacute;s
 take-out food service companies
 supermarkets and convenience stores. Our competitors change with each of the four
day parts
 ranging from coffee bars and bakery caf&eacute;s to casual dining chains. Many of our competitors or potential competitors
have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do
 which may allow them to react to changes in the market quicker
than we can. In addition
 aggressive pricing by our competitors or the entrance of new competitors into our markets
 could reduce
our revenue and operating margins. We also compete with other employers in our markets for workers and may become subject to higher
labor costs as a result of such competition.


    
    



Fluctuations
in various food and supply costs
 particularly fruit and dairy
 could adversely affect our operating results.

Supplies
and prices of the various ingredients that we are going to use to can be affected by a variety of factors
 such as weather
 seasonal
fluctuations
 demand
 politics and economics in the producing countries.

These
factors subject us to shortages or interruptions in product supplies
 which could adversely affect our revenue and profits. In
addition
 the prices of fruit and dairy
 which are the main ingredients in our products
 can be highly volatile. The fruit of
the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis
 depending on supply and demand at the time of the purchase. An increase
in pricing of any fruit that we are going to use in our products could have a significant adverse effect on our profitability.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to secure our fruit supply.

Our
business depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior management and other key personnel
 and our business may
be severely disrupted if we lose their services.

Our
future success heavily depends on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. If one or more of our
senior executives is unable or unwilling to continue to work for us in his present position
 we may have to spend a considerable
amount of time and resources searching
 recruiting
 and integrating a replacement into our operations
 which would substantially
divert management&rsquo;s attention from our business and severely disrupt our business. This may also adversely affect our ability
to execute our business strategy.

Our
senior management&rsquo;s limited experience managing a publicly traded company may divert management&rsquo;s attention from operations
and harm our business.

With
the exception of our Chief Financial Officer
 our senior management team has relatively limited experience managing a publicly
traded company and complying with federal securities laws
 including compliance with recently adopted disclosure requirements
on a timely basis. Our management will be required to design and implement appropriate programs and policies in responding to
increased legal
 regulatory compliance and reporting requirements
 and any failure to do so could lead to the imposition of fines
and penalties and harm our business.

We
may be unable to attract and retain qualified
 experienced
 highly skilled personnel
 which could adversely affect the implementation
of our business plan.

Our
success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract
 retain and motivate skilled and qualified personnel. As we
become a more mature company in the future
 we may find recruiting and retention efforts more challenging. If we do not succeed
in attracting
 hiring and integrating excellent personnel
 or retaining and motivating existing personnel
 we may be unable to
grow effectively. The loss of any key employee
 including members of our senior management team
 and our inability to attract
highly skilled personnel with sufficient experience in our industries could harm our business.

Product
liability exposure may expose us to significant liability.

We
may face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability and other claims and lawsuits in the event that the development
or use of our technology or prospective products is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects. We may not be able to avoid significant
liability exposure. Although we believe our insurance coverage to be adequate
 we may not have sufficient insurance coverage
and we may not be able to obtain sufficient coverage at a reasonable cost. An inability to obtain product liability insurance
at acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization
of our products. A product liability claim could hurt our financial performance. Even if we ultimately avoid financial liability
for this type of exposure
 we may incur significant costs in defending ourselves that could hurt our financial performance and
condition.

Our
inability to protect our intellectual property rights may force us to incur unanticipated costs.

Our
success will depend
 in part
 on our ability to obtain and maintain protection in the United States and internationally for certain
intellectual property incorporated into our products. Our intellectual property rights may be challenged
 narrowed
 invalidated
or circumvented
 which could limit our ability to prevent competitors from marketing similar solutions that limit the effectiveness
of our patent protection and force us to incur unanticipated costs. In addition
 existing laws of some countries in which we may
provide services or solutions may offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights.


    
    



Our
products may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties
 and third parties may infringe our proprietary rights
either of which may result in lawsuits
 distraction of management and the impairment of our business.

As
the number of patents
 copyrights
 trademarks and other intellectual property rights in our industry increases
 products based
on our technology may increasingly become the subject of infringement claims. Third parties could assert infringement claims against
us in the future. Infringement claims with or without merit could be time consuming
 result in costly litigation
 cause product
shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Royalty or licensing agreements
 if required
 might
not be available on terms acceptable to us
 or at all. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement
of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Litigation to determine the validity of any
claims
 whether or not the litigation is resolved in our favor
 could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts
of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks. If there is an adverse ruling against us in any litigation
 we
may be required to pay substantial damages
 discontinue the use and sale of infringing products and expend significant resources
to develop non-infringing technology or obtain licenses to infringing technology. Our failure to develop or license a substitute
technology could prevent us from selling our products.

If
securities or industry analysts do not publish research
 or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research
 about our business
 our
share price and trading volume could decline.

The
trading market for our common stock may be impacted
 in part
 by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts
publish about our business or us. There can be no assurance that analysts will cover us
 continue to cover us or provide favorable
coverage. If one or more analysts downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock
 our share price may decline. In addition
if one or more analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us
 we could lose visibility in
the financial markets
 which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.

We
will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company
 and our management will be required to devote
substantial time to compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.

As
a public company
 we will continue to incur significant legal
 accounting and other expenses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various
requirements on public companies
 including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate
governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these
compliance initiatives. Moreover
 these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make
some activities more time-consuming and costly.

We
cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur to continue to operate as a public company
 nor can we
predict the timing of such costs. These rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations
 in many cases due
to their lack of specificity
 and
 as a result
 their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided
by regulatory and governing bodies which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs
necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.

Failure
to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.

As
a Delaware corporation
 we are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 which generally prohibits United States
companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining
business. Some foreign companies
 including some that may compete with our Company
 may not be subject to these prohibitions.
Corruption
 extortion
 bribery
 pay-offs
 theft and other fraudulent practices may occur from time-to-time in countries in which
we conduct our business. However
 our employees or other agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible.
If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices
 we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences
that may have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations.


    
    



It
is difficult to predict the timing and amount of our sales because our distributors and national accounts may not be required
to place minimum orders with us.

Our
distributors are not required to place minimum monthly or annual orders for our products. Accordingly
 we cannot predict the timing
or quantity of purchases by any of our independent distributors or whether any of our distributors will continue to purchase products
from us in the same frequencies and volumes as they may have done in the past. Additionally
 our larger distributors and partners
may make orders that are larger than we have historically been required to fill. Shortages in inventory levels
 supply of raw
materials or other key supplies could negatively affect us.

If
we do not adequately manage our inventory levels
 our operating results could be adversely affected.

We
need to maintain adequate inventory levels to be able to deliver products on a timely basis. Our inventory supply depends on our
ability to correctly estimate demand for our products. Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise
 particularly
for new products
 seasonal promotions and new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to
maintain sufficient inventory of raw materials
 we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. If we overestimate
retailer demand for our products
 we may end up with too much inventory
 resulting in higher storage costs
 increased trade spend
and the risk of obsolete inventory. If we fail to manage our inventory to meet demand
 we could damage our relationships with
our retailers and could delay or lose sales opportunities
 which would unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect
our operating results.

Risks
Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock

Our
common stock is quoted on the OTCQB
 which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.

Our
common stock is quoted on the OTCQB
 which is a significantly more limited trading market than the New York Stock Exchange
 or
the NASDAQ Stock Market. The quotation of the Company&rsquo;s shares on the OTCQB may result in a less liquid market available
for existing and potential shareholders to trade shares of our common stock
 could depress the trading price of our common stock
and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future.

There
is limited liquidity on the OTCQB
 which may result in stock price volatility and inaccurate quote information.

When
fewer shares of a security are being traded on the OTCQB
 volatility of prices may increase and price movement may outpace the
ability to deliver accurate quote information. Due to lower trading volumes in shares of our common stock
 there may be a lower
likelihood of one&rsquo;s orders for shares of our common stock being executed
 and current prices may differ significantly from
the price one was quoted at the time of one&rsquo;s order entry.

If
we are unable to adequately fund our operations
 we may be forced to voluntarily file for deregistration of our common stock with
the SEC.

Compliance
with the periodic reporting requirements required by the SEC consumes a considerable amount of both internal
 as well external
resources and represents a significant cost for us. If we are unable to continue to devote adequate funding and the resources
needed to maintain such compliance
 while continuing our operations
 we could be forced to deregister with the SEC. After the
deregistration process
 our common stock would only be tradable on the &ldquo;Pink Sheets&rdquo; and could suffer a decrease in
or absence of liquidity.


    
    



Because
we became public by means of a &ldquo;reverse merger&rdquo;
 we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms.

Additional
risks may exist since we became public through a &ldquo;reverse merger&rdquo;. Securities analysts of major brokerage firms may
not provide coverage of us since there is little incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. We
cannot assure you that brokerage firms will want to conduct any secondary offerings on behalf of our Company in the future.

Future
sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise funds
in future securities offerings.

Future
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market
 or the perception that such sales may occur
could adversely affect the then prevailing market price of our common stock and could make it more difficult for us to raise funds
in the future through a public offering of our securities.

Our
common stock is thinly traded
 so you may be unable to sell at or near asking prices or at all if you need to sell your shares
to raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares.

Currently
the Company&rsquo;s common stock is quoted in the OTCQB and future trading volume may be limited by the fact that many major institutional
investment funds
 including mutual funds
 as well as individual investors follow a policy of not investing in OTCQB stocks and
certain major brokerage firms restrict their brokers from recommending OTCQB stocks because they are considered speculative
 volatile
and thinly traded. The OTCQB market is an inter-dealer market much less regulated than the major exchanges and our common stock
is subject to abuses
 volatility and shorting. Thus
 there is currently no broadly followed and established trading market for
the Company&rsquo;s common stock. An established trading market may never develop or be maintained. Active trading markets generally
result in lower price volatility and more efficient execution of buy and sell orders. Absence of an active trading market reduces
the liquidity of the shares traded there.

The
trading volume of our common stock has been and may continue to be limited and sporadic. As a result of such trading activity
the quoted price for the Company&rsquo;s common stock on the OTCQB may not necessarily be a reliable indicator of its fair market
value. Further
 if we cease to be quoted
 holders would find it more difficult to dispose of our common stock or to obtain accurate
quotations as to the market value of the Company&rsquo;s common stock and as a result
 the market value of our common stock likely
would decline.

Our
common stock is subject to price volatility unrelated to our operations.

The
market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors
 including market perception of our
ability to achieve our planned growth
 quarterly operating results of other companies in the same industry
 trading volume in
our common stock
 changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting the Company&rsquo;s
competitors or the Company itself. In addition
 the OTCQB is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations in general. This
volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their
operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock.

We
are subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock.

Our
common stock is currently quoted on the OTCQB. Our common stock is subject to the requirements of Rule 15(g)-9
 promulgated under
the Securities Exchange Act as long as the price of our common stock is below $5.00 per share. Under such rule
 broker-dealers
who recommend low-priced securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must satisfy special
sales practice requirements
 including a requirement that they make an individualized written suitability determination for the
purchaser and receive the purchaser&rsquo;s consent prior to the transaction. The Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock
Reform Act of 1990
 also requires additional disclosure in connection with any trades involving a stock defined as a penny stock.
Generally
 the Commission defines a penny stock as any equity security not traded on a national exchange that has a market price
of less than $5.00 per share. The required penny stock disclosures include the delivery
 prior to any transaction
 of a disclosure
schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with it. Such requirements could severely limit the market
liquidity of the securities and the ability of purchasers to sell their securities in the secondary market.


    
    



Because
we do not intend to pay dividends
 shareholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in
value.

We
have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our preferred stock or common stock. For the foreseeable future
 it is expected
that earnings
 if any
 generated from our operations will be used to finance the growth of our business
 and that no dividends
will be paid to holders of the Company&rsquo;s common stock. As a result
 the success of an investment in our common stock will
depend upon any future appreciation in its value. There can be no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value.

The
price of our common stock may become volatile
 which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.

The
trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate in response to factors such as:



    
    
actual
    or anticipated variations in our operating results;

    
    
    

    
    
announcements
    of developments by us or our competitors;

    
    
    

    
    
announcements
    by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions
 strategic partnerships
 joint ventures or capital commitments;

    
    
    

    
    
adoption
    of new accounting standards affecting the our industry;

    
    
    

    
    
additions
    or departures of key personnel;

    
    
    

    
    
introduction
    of new products by us or our competitors;

    
    
    

    
    
sales
    of our common stock or other securities in the open market; and

    
    
    

    
    
other
    events or factors
 many of which are beyond our control.


The
stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations. In the past
 following periods of volatility in the market
price of a company&rsquo;s securities
 securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such a company. Litigation
initiated against us
 whether or not successful
 could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management&rsquo;s attention
and Company resources
 which could harm our business and financial condition.

Investors
may experience dilution of their ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock.

We
intend to continue to seek financing through the issuance of equity or convertible securities to fund our operations. In the future
we may also issue additional equity securities resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present shareholders.
We may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common
stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees
 future acquisitions or for other business purposes. The future issuance
of any such additional shares of common stock will result in dilution to our shareholders and may create downward pressure on
the trading price of our common stock.


    
    



Provisions
in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company
 which may be beneficial to
our stockholders
 more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.

Provisions
in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage
 delay or prevent a merger
 acquisition or other change in control
of our company that stockholders may consider favorable
 including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium
for your shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of
our common stock
 thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition
 because our board of directors is responsible
for appointing the members of our management team
 these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders
to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors.
In addition
 because we are incorporated in Delaware
 we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law
 which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining
with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding
voting stock
 unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.

Item
7. Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The
information and financial data discussed below is derived from the audited financial statements of Barfresh for its fiscal year
ended December 31
 2018 and for the fiscal year ended December 31
 2017. The financial statements of Barfresh were prepared and
presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The information and financial data
discussed below is only a summary and should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and related notes
of Barfresh contained elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis may contain forward-looking statements based
on assumptions about our future business. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements as a result of certain factors. See &ldquo;Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements&rdquo; above for a
discussion of forward-looking statements and the significance of such statements in the context of this Annual Report.


Barfresh
is a leader in the creation
 manufacturing and distribution of ready to blend frozen beverages. The current portfolio of products
includes smoothies
 shakes and frappes. Products are packaged in two distinct formats.


The
Company&rsquo;s original single serve format features portion controlled and ready to blend beverage ingredient packs or &ldquo;beverage
packs&rdquo;. The beverage packs contain all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage
 including the base (either
sorbet
 frozen yogurt or ice cream)
 real fruit pieces
 juices and ice &ndash; five ounces of water are added before blending.

The
Company&rsquo;s bulk &ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo; format also contains all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage
packaged in gallon containers in a concentrated formula that is mixed &ldquo;one to one&rdquo; with water. The Company has a &ldquo;no
sugar added&rdquo; version of the bulk &ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo; format that is specifically targeted for the USDA national school
meal program
 including the School Breakfast Program
 the National School Lunch Program
 and Smart Snacks in Schools Program.
The Company is currently in contract to sell its bulk Easy Pour products into over three hundred schools. In addition
 the Company
received approval from the United States Defense Logistics Agency (&ldquo;DLA&rdquo;) to sell its smoothie products into all branches
of the U.S. Armed Forces
 and is currently in contract to sell its bulk Easy Pour products into over one hundred military bases
in the United States.

Domestic
and international patents and patents pending are owned by Barfresh
 as well as related trademarks for all of the single serve
products. Patent rights have been granted in 13 jurisdictions including the United States. In addition
 the Company has purchased
all of the trademarks related to the patented products.

The
Company conducts sales through several channels
 including National Accounts
 Regional Accounts
 and Broadline Distributors. Barfresh&rsquo;s
primary broadline distribution arrangement is through an exclusive nationwide agreement with Sysco Corporation (&ldquo;Sysco&rdquo;)
the U.S.&rsquo;s largest broadline distributor
 which was entered into during July 2014. Pursuant to that agreement
 all Barfresh
products are included in Sysco&rsquo;s national core selection of beverage items
 making Barfresh its exclusive single-serve
pre-portioned beverage provider. The agreement is mutually exclusive; however
 Barfresh may also sell the products to other foodservice
distributors
 but only to the extent required for such foodservice distributors to service multi-unit chain operators with at
least 20 units and where Sysco is not such multi- unit chain operator&rsquo;s nominated distributor for our products. On October
2
 2017
 the Sysco agreement was extended for an additional two year period
 and expanded to cover bulk easy pour products
 on
a non-exclusive basis.

During
2016 and 2017 the Company announced that it had signed supply agreements with several of the major global on-site foodservice
operators. On March 8
 2018
 the Company announced that it had signed a new supply agreement with one of the largest of these
foodservice operators
 for exclusive distribution of four of Barfresh&rsquo;s single serve sku&rsquo;s. On November 14
 2018
the Company announced that it had received approval for multiple products to be rolled out to a national restaurant chain with
over 2
500 locations.

On
October 26
 2015
 Barfresh signed a five year agreement with PepsiCo North America Beverages
 a division of PepsiCo
 to become
its exclusive sales representative within the food service channel to present Barfresh&rsquo;s line of ready-to-blend smoothies
and frozen beverages throughout the United States and Canada. Through this agreement
 Barfresh&rsquo; products are included as
part of PepsiCo&rsquo;s offerings to its significant customer base. The agreement facilitates access to potential National customer
accounts
 through introductions provided by PepsiCo&rsquo;s one-thousand plus person foodservice sales team. Barfresh products
have become part of PepsiCo&rsquo;s customer presentations at national trade shows and similar venues.

Barfresh
utilizes contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the products in the United States. Production lines are currently operational
at two locations. The first location is in Salt Lake City
 which currently produces both bulk easy pour and single serve products.
Annual production capacity with this contract manufacturer is 14 million units per year. The second location is with Yarnell Operations
LLC.
 a subsidiary of Shulze and Burch
 located in Arkansas. The Yarnell&rsquo;s agreement
 which was signed during February
2016
 and secures the capacity to ramp up to an incremental production capacity of 100 million units. Yarnell&rsquo;s location
enhances the company&rsquo;s ability to efficiently move product throughout the supply chain to destinations in the eastern United
States
 home to many of the country&rsquo;s large foodservice outlets.


    
    



During
November
 2016
 the Company received an equity investment from Unibel
 the majority shareholder of the Bel Group (&ldquo;Unibel&rdquo;).
The Bel Group is headquartered in Paris
 France
 with global operations in 33 countries
 30 production sites on 4 continents and
nearly 12
000 employees. Its many branded products
 including The Laughing Cow&reg;
 Mini Babybel&reg; and Boursin&reg;
 are sold
in over 130 countries around the world. Pursuant to the securities purchase agreement
 Unibel purchased 15
625
000 shares of common
stock at $0.64 per share (&ldquo;Shares&rdquo;) and warrants to purchase 7
812
500 shares of common stock (&ldquo;Warrants&rdquo;)
for aggregate gross proceeds to Barfresh of $10 million. The Warrants are exercisable for a term of five years at a per share
price of $.88 for cash. Pursuant to the Investor Rights agreement
 Barfresh has registered the Shares and the Warrants
 and Unibel
was granted a seat on the Barfresh Board. This strategic investment provided Barfresh with necessary capital while leveraging
Unibel&rsquo;s more than 150 years of industrial expertise
 innovative capabilities
 world-class marketing and branding expertise
to accelerate our growth in new and existing markets and product channels.

On
February 14
 2018
 the Company announced the private placement of convertible notes with gross proceeds of $4.1 million The closing
of the first 60% of this amount occurred between March 12 and 22
 2018
 after notice was issued by the Company that it had entered
into a material agreement or series of related agreements with a national account for the sale of its products into approximately
1
000 new locations. The remaining 40% of the principal amount was to be received upon achieving a second milestone
 which is
entering into a material agreement or series of related agreements with a national account for the sale of its products into approximately
2
500 new locations. During November of 2018 the Company and several of the Convertible Note investors agreed to amend the definition
of Milestone 2 to allow for the funding the remaining 40% of the principal amount upon the Company receiving approval from a National
Restaurant Chain with over 2
500 for the rollout of its products. Such approval was received during the fourth quarter of 2018
and the Company received an additional $1.4 million of convertible note proceeds.

The
convertible notes are unsecured and have (i) a two-year term
 (ii) a 10% annual coupon to be paid in cash or stock at the Company&rsquo;s
discretion at a conversion price equal to 85% of the average closing bid prices of the Common Stock over the twenty (20) consecutive
trading day period immediately preceding the payment date
 but in no event lower than sixty cents ($0.60) per share of Common
Stock. The investor&rsquo;s may elect to convert their principal into common stock at a conversion price equal to the lower of:
(i) $0.88 per share of Common Stock
 or (ii) 85% of the average closing bid prices of the Common Stock over the twenty (20) consecutive
trading day period immediately preceding the date of investor&rsquo;s election to convert; but in no event lower than $0.60 per
share of Common Stock. Investors also received warrant coverage of 25% of the number of shares that would be issuable upon a full
conversion of the principal amount at an average of the twenty consecutive trading day period immediately preceding the applicable
closing date. If any principal amount remains outstanding after the one-year anniversary of the closing
 investors will be granted
an additional warrant with identical terms. The warrants are exercisable for a period of three years for cash at the greater of
120% of the closing price or $0.70 per share of common stock. After the initial private placement
 investors were offered the
opportunity to accelerate the issuance of the additional warrant by increasing their convertible note investment by 10% to 20%.
After the close of the first quarter
 a number of investors took advantage of this acceleration opportunity
 resulting in an increase
in the amount of the total convertible note by $177
300 and the issuance of 930
332 additional warrants. During the fourth quarter
four of the convertible note investors elected to convert their notes into stock
 with a total of $453
000 of convertible debt
plus accrued interest being converted into stock.

During
the fourth quarter of 2018
 one investor exercised 833
333 N warrants for cash
 at $0.45 per share. $221
918 of the proceeds of
that transaction were used to pay down a short term note payable
 held by the same investor
 in the amount of $200
000
 plus accrued
interest. The balance of the proceeds of the N warrant exercise
 in the amount of $153
082 were received by the Company.

During
the first quarter of 2019
 the Company completed additional funding efforts
 including a Private Placement Offering for common
shares priced at $0.60 per share
 resulting in the receipt of capital investment in the amount of $2.4 million and the issuance
of 3
833
333 shares. In addition
 during the first quarter of 2019 the Company offered to reduce the exercise price on its I Warrants
from $1 to $0.60
 for a limited time. During the time this offer was open
 I Warrant holders converted 2
841
454 warrants at $0.60
resulting in the receipt of capital investment in the amount of $1.7 million.. In addition
 during the first quarter of 2019
one investor exercised G series warrants
 resulting in the receipt of capital investment in the amount of $180
000
 and the issuance
of 300
000 shares. In total
 during the first quarter of 2019 the Company has raised $4.3 million and issued 7
141
454 shares
and no additional warrants.

Critical
Accounting Policies

Our
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;).

Revenue
Recognition

In
accordance with ASC 606
 &ldquo;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&rdquo;
 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains ownership
of promised goods. The Company adopted this standard at the beginning of fiscal year 2018
 with no significant impact to its financial
position or results of operations
 using the modified retrospective method. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration
to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods. The Company applies the following five steps:



    
    
Identify
    the contract with a customer

    
    
    

    
    
A
    contract with a customer exists when (i) the Company enters into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each
    party&rsquo;s rights
 (ii) the contract has commercial substance and
 (iii) the Company determines that collection of substantially
    all consideration for goods or services that are transferred is probable. For the Company
 the contract is the approved sales
    order
 which may also be supplemented by other agreements that formalize various terms and conditions with customers.

    
    
    

    
    
Identify
    the performance obligation in the contract

    
    
    

    
    
Performance
    obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or that will be transferred to the customer. For the
    Company
 this consists of the delivery of frozen beverages
 which provide immediate benefit to the customer.

    
    
    

    
    
Determine
    the transaction price

    
    
    

    
    
The
    transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring
    goods
 and is generally stated on the approved sales order. Variable consideration
 which typically includes volume-based
    rebates or discounts
 are estimated utilizing the most likely amount method.

    
    
    

    
    
Allocate
    the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract 
    delivery of frozen beverages
 the transaction price is allocated to that single performance obligation.

    
    
    

    
    
Recognize
    Revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation

    
    
    

    
    
The
    Company recognizes revenue from the sale of frozen beverages when title and risk of loss passes and the customer accepts the
    goods
 which generally occurs at delivery. Customer sales incentives such as volume-based rebates or discounts are treated
    as a reduction of sales at the time the sale is recognized. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and
    presented in distribution
 selling and administrative costs.

    
    
    

    
    
The
    company evaluated the requirement to disaggregate revenue
 and concluded that substantially all of its revenue comes from
    a single product
 frozen beverages.


Share-based
Compensation

We
account for share-based employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance
with applicable accounting standards
 which require all share-based payments to employees
 including grants of stock options and
restricted stock units (RSUs)
 to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards
 with the resulting expense generally
recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the
award.


    
    



Convertible
Notes

We
issue debt that may have separate warrants
 conversion features
 or no equity-linked attributes. When we issue debt with warrants
we determine the value of the warrants using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model (&ldquo;Black-Scholes&rdquo;) using the stock
price on the date of issuance
 the risk free interest rate associated with the life of the debt
 and the estimated volatility
of our stock. When we issue debt with a conversion feature
 we must first assess whether the conversion feature meets the requirements
to be treated as a derivative. If the conversion feature within convertible debt meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative
we estimate the fair value of the convertible debt derivative using Black-Scholes upon the date of issuance
 using the stock price
on the date of issuance
 the risk free interest rate associated with the life of the debt
 and the estimated volatility of our
stock. If the conversion feature is not treated as a derivative
 we assess whether it is a beneficial conversion feature (&ldquo;BCF&rsquo;).
A BCF exists if the conversion price of the convertible debt instrument is less than the stock price on the commitment date. This
typically occurs when the conversion price is less than the fair value of the stock on the date the instrument was issued. The
value of a BCF is equal to the intrinsic value of the feature
 the difference between the conversion price and the common stock
into which it is convertible.

Derivative
Liability

The
Company evaluates its convertible instruments
 options
 warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded
components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under ASC Topic 815
 &ldquo;Derivatives and
Hedging.&rdquo; The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of any derivative is marked-to-market each balance
sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability
 the change in fair value
is recorded in the statement of operations as gain/loss from derivative liability. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative
instrument
 the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity.
We analyzed the derivative financial instruments in accordance with ASC 815. The objective is to provide guidance for determining
whether an equity-linked financial instrument is indexed to an entity&rsquo;s own stock. This determination is needed for a scope
exception which would enable a derivative instrument to be accounted for under the accrual method. The classification of a non-derivative
instrument that falls within the scope of ASC 815-40-05 &ldquo;Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to
 and
Potentially Settled in
 a Company&rsquo;s Own Stock&rdquo; also hinges on whether the instrument is indexed to an entity&rsquo;s
own stock. A non-derivative instrument that is not indexed to an entity&rsquo;s own stock cannot be classified as equity and must
be accounted for as a liability. There is a two-step approach in determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed
to an entity&rsquo;s own stock. First
 the instrument&rsquo;s contingent exercise provisions
 if any
 must be evaluated
 followed
by an evaluation of the instrument&rsquo;s settlement provisions. The Company utilized the fair value standard set forth by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board
 defined as the amount at which the assets (or liability) could be bought (or incurred) or
sold (or settled) in a current transaction between willing parties
 that is
 other than in a forced or liquidation sale.

Results
of Operations

Revenue
and cost of revenue

Revenue
increased $2
238
147 (112%) from $1
997
012 in 2017 to $4
235
159 in 2018. The increase in revenue is primarily the result of
the rollout of our new bulk Easy Pour product which began during the first quarter of 2017 and has continued to gain momentum
during 2018. Our products continue to be distributed through all 72 of Sysco&rsquo;s U.S. mainland distribution centers
 as well
as through new customers beyond the Sysco distribution network.

Cost
of revenue for 2018 was $2
090
495 as compared to $1
107
341 in 2017. Our gross profit was $2
144
664 (51%) and $889
671 (45%)
for 2018 and 2017
 respectively. This improvement was driven by a number factors
 including leverage due to larger scale of production
and product mix. We anticipate that our gross profit percentage for 2019 will be comparable to that of 2018.


    
    



Operating
expenses

Our
operations were primarily directed towards increasing sales and expanding our distribution network.

Our
general and administrative expenses decreased $1
678
669 (18%) from $9
492
094 in 2017 to $7
813
425 in 2018
 with the improvement
primarily driven by lower personnel expenses resulting from the realignment of our sales force. The following is a breakdown of
our general and administrative expenses for the years 2018 and 2017.

Personnel
cost represents the cost of employees including salaries
 bonuses
 employee benefits and employment taxes for the years 2018 and
2017 and continues to be our largest cost. Personnel cost decreased $1
233
398 (29%) from $4
260
946 to $3
027
548. During the
fourth quarters of 2016 and 2017
 we realigned ours sales force to a more efficient model
 by increasing the number of dedicated
sales brokers that represent our products
 and reducing the number of sales force employees. At year end 2017 we had 30 full time
employees
 and we currently have 26 full time employees.

Stock
based compensation is used as an incentive to attract new employees and to compensate existing employees. Stock based compensation
includes stock issued and options granted to employees. Stock compensation for the current year was $498
768
 a decrease of $861
920
or 63%
 from the year ago expense of $1
360
688. The decrease is primarily due to reductions in our workforce and the timing of
equity grants. The Company issues additional stock options to its employees from time to time under its Equity Compensation Plan.

Legal
and professional fees were relatively flat between 2018 and 2017
 with a small decrease $1
746
 from $465
737 in 2017 to $463
991
in 2018. We anticipate legal fees related to our business and financing activities to increase as our business continues to grow.

Travel
expenses increased $9
856 (2%) from $422
284 in 2017 to $432
140 in 2018. The increase is primarily due to the net effect of the
decrease in travel costs associated with terminated employees
 offset by the increase in per employee travel costs as remaining
employees have been asked to cover larger territories. We anticipate that travel expenses for 2019 will be comparable to the current
year.

Rent
expense is primarily for our location in Beverly Hills
 California. Rent expense for the Beverly Hills office is approximately
$14
488 per month. During 2018 we leased office space at 8383 Wilshire Boulevard
 Beverly Hills
 California pursuant to a lease
that commenced on November 1
 2016 and expired March 31
 2019. Effective April 1
 2019
 we have entered into a new lease for office
space located at 3600 Wilshire Boulevard Suite 1720
 Los Angeles
 90010.


    
    



Marketing
and selling expenses increased $53
806 (8%) from $696
253 in 2017 to $750
059 in 2018. Higher marketing and selling expenses
were primarily due to higher sales agent commissions associated with higher sales during the year.

Consulting
fees decreased $143
362 (70%)
 from $203
721 in 2017
 to $60
359 in 2018. Our consulting fees vary based on needs. We engaged
consultants in the areas of sales and operations during the both 2018 and 2017. The need for future consulting services will be
variable.

Director
fees increased $34
704 (17%) from $206
296 in 2017 to $241
000 in 2018. Annual director fees are anticipated at $50
000 per non-employee
director.

Research
and development expenses increased $99
235
 (17%) from $574
989 in 2017 to $674
224 in 2018. These expenses relate to the services
performed by our Director of Manufacturing and Product Development
 and consultants supporting that employee. These activities
are primarily directed towards to development of new products.

Shipping
and storage expense increased $245
000 (40%) from $619
871 in 2017 to $864
871 in 2018. Shipping and storage expense as a percentage
of revenue decreased from 31% in 2017 to 20% in 2018. This improvement is primarily due to the growth of the scale of our business
and the corresponding cost savings associated with freight movement. We anticipate that shipping and storage expense as a percentage
of sales will continue to reduce in the future
 as the Company continues to take advantage of more efficient distribution arrangements.

Other
expenses consist of ordinary operating expenses such as investor relations
 office
 telephone
 insurance
 and stock related costs.
We anticipate these expenses to be comparable for the balance of the year.

We
had operating losses of $6
180
080 in 2018 and $8
911
540 in 2017. The improvement of $2
731
460 or 31%
 was primarily
due to higher gross profit margin on higher sales
 and lower G&amp;A expenses.

Interest
expense for 2018 is $764
813 relates to &ldquo;Milestone 1&rdquo; convertible debt in the amount of $2
704
800 that was issued
on March 14
 2018
 which bears interest at 10%
 &ldquo;Milestone 2&rdquo; convertible debt in the amount of $1
363
200
 that was
issued on November 30
 2018
 which bears interest at 10%
 and to a note payable in the amount of $250
000 that was issued on March
5
 2018. Of the Milestone 1 convertible debt
 $453
000 of principal
 and the accrued interest thereon
 was converted into stock
during the fourth quarter of 2018. The principal and accrued interest on the Note Payable in the amount of $250
000 was repaid
during the fourth quarter of 2018. Interest expense for 2018 includes amortization of $519
707 of the value of warrants
issued with the Milestone 1 and Milestone 2 convertible debt.

The
change in fair value of the derivative liability resulted in a loss of $87
630 for the year ended December 31
 2018. This results
from the netting of a loss of $198
454 from the change in value of the derivative
 partially offset by gain on the conversion
to stock of convertible notes during the fourth quarter of 2018.

The
warrant modification was revalued at July 31
 2018 with a value of $452
308. The difference in fair value immediately before and
after the modification of the warrant resulted in a loss of $290
300.

We
had net losses of $7
322
823 and $8
911
540 for the years 2018 and 2017
 respectively. This reduction in net loss
 in the amount
of $1
588
717
 or 18%
 is primarily attributable to the same factors that drove the improvement in operating losses
 partially
offset by certain non-cash charges
 including higher interest
 warrant modification
 and loss from derivative liability
 in 2018.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

As
of December 31
 2018
 we had a working capital surplus of $652
360 as compared with a working capital surplus of $1
774
719 at
December 31
 2017. The reduction in working capital surplus is primarily due to the reduction in cash raised from investing activities
and significant increases in current liabilities
 partially offset by a reduction of cash used in operations.




    
    



During
the twelve month period ended December 31
 2018
 we used cash of $4
128
284 in operations
 $1
106
574 for the purchase
of equipment
 net of proceeds of $37
967 for sale of equipment
 and $14
456 for patents and trademarks

Our
liquidity needs will depend on how quickly we are able to profitably ramp up sales
 as well as our ability to control and reduce
variable operating expenses
 and to continue to control and reduce fixed overhead expense.

On
February 14
 2018
 the Company announced the private placement of convertible notes with gross proceeds of $4.1 million The closing
of the first 60% of this amount occurred between March 12 and 22
 2018
 after notice was issued by the Company that it had entered
into a material agreement or series of related agreements with a national account for the sale of its products into approximately
1
000 new locations. The remaining 40% of the principal amount was to be received upon achieving a second milestone
 which is
entering into a material agreement or series of related agreements with a national account for the sale of its products into approximately
2
500 new locations. During November of 2018 the Company and several of the Convertible Note investors agreed to amend the definition
of Milestone 2 to allow for the funding the remaining 40% of the principal amount upon the Company receiving approval from a National
Restaurant Chain with over 2
500 for the rollout of its products. Such approval was received during the fourth quarter of 2018
and the Company received an additional $1.4 million of convertible note proceeds.

The
convertible notes are unsecured and have (i) a two-year term
 (ii) a 10% annual coupon to be paid in cash or stock at the Company&rsquo;s
discretion at a conversion price equal to 85% of the average closing bid prices of the Common Stock over the twenty (20) consecutive
trading day period immediately preceding the payment date
 but in no event lower than sixty cents ($0.60) per share of Common
Stock. The investor&rsquo;s may elect to convert their principal into common stock at a conversion price equal to the lower of:
(i) $0.88 per share of Common Stock
 or (ii) 85% of the average closing bid prices of the Common Stock over the twenty (20) consecutive
trading day period immediately preceding the date of investor&rsquo;s election to convert; but in no event lower than $0.60 per
share of Common Stock. Investors also received warrant coverage of 25% of the number of shares that would be issuable upon a full
conversion of the principal amount at an average of the twenty consecutive trading day period immediately preceding the applicable
closing date. If any principal amount remains outstanding after the one-year anniversary of the closing
 investors will be granted
an additional warrant with identical terms. The warrants are exercisable for a period of three years for cash at the greater of
120% of the closing price or $0.70 per share of common stock. After the initial private placement
 investors were offered the
opportunity to accelerate the issuance of the additional warrant by increasing their convertible note investment by 10% to 20%.
After the close of the first quarter
 a number of investors took advantage of this acceleration opportunity
 resulting in an increase
in the amount of the total convertible note by $177
300 and the issuance of 930
332 additional warrants. During the fourth quarter
four of the convertible note investors elected to convert their notes into stock
 with a total of $453
000 of convertible debt
plus accrued interest being converted into stock.

During
the fourth quarter of 2018
 one investor exercised 833
333 N warrants for cash
 at $0.45 per share. $221
918 of the proceeds of
that transaction were used to pay down a short term note payable
 held by the same investor
 in the amount of $200
000
 plus accrued
interest. The balance of the proceeds of the N warrant exercise
 in the amount of $153
082 were received by the Company.

During
the first quarter of 2019
 the Company completed additional funding efforts
 including a Private Placement Offering for common
shares priced at $0.60 per share
 resulting in the receipt of capital investment in the amount of $2.4 million and the issuance
of 3
833
333 shares. In addition
 during the first quarter of 2019 the Company offered to reduce the exercise price on its I Warrants
from $1 to $0.60
 for a limited time. During the time this offer was open
 I Warrant holders converted 2
841
454 warrants at $0.60
resulting in the receipt of capital investment in the amount of $1.7 million. In addition
 during the first quarter of 2019
 one
investor exercised G series warrants
 resulting in the receipt of capital investment in the amount of $180
000
 and the issuance
of 300
000 shares. In total
 during the first quarter of 2019 the Company has raised $4.3 million and issued 7
141
454 shares
and no additional warrants.


Our
operations to date have been financed by the sale of securities
 the issuance of convertible debt and the issuance of short-term
debt
 including related party advances. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations with the capital raised
we will be required to raise additional funds either in the form of capital or in the form of debt. There are no assurances that
we will be able to generate the necessary capital to carry out our current plan of operations.


    
    



We
have entered into a direct lease for a new premises covering the period April 1
 2019 to March 31
 2023. The aggregate minimum
requirements under the non-cancellable direct lease as of April 2019 is $309
929.

The framework used by management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled &ldquo;Internal
Control &ndash; Integrated Framework&rdquo; issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)
in 2013.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as such term is defined under Securities and Exchange Act
of 1934 Rules 13a-15(f). Based on this evaluation
 our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that
the Company&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31
 2018.


    
    


Management
recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control
 and accordingly
 even effective
internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or
detect material misstatements. In addition
 effective internal control at a point in time may become ineffective in future periods
because of changes in conditions or due to deterioration in the degree of compliance with our established policies and procedures.

Remediation
of Previously Identified Material Weakness 

Management
previously identified and disclosed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting at December 31
 2017
which related to inadequate segregation of duties
 due to an inadequate number of personnel to properly implement controls over
financial reporting. As of December 31
 2018
 management sufficiently completed its remediation of this material weakness by taking
the following actions:


Implementation
                                         of a formal quarterly and annual closing checklist
 with clearly identified review process


Establishment
                                         and implementation of detailed Operating Manual covering all key Company processes


Utilization
                                         of commercially available positive pay check process to mitigate risk of bank fraud


Implementation
                                         of on-line approval process for approval and signing of all customer contracts


Establishment
                                         of formal approval process for equipment ordering
 and separation of responsibility for
                                         approval process from equipment ordering process


Separation
                                         of duties for receiving customer orders for products
 and issuing customer invoices


Establishment
                                         of a Company-wide Code of Conduct

This
report shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act
 or otherwise subject to the liabilities
of that section
 and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company
 whether made before or after the date hereof
regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Except
for those remedial actions described above
 there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during
the fiscal year ended December 31
 2018 that has materially affected
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal
control over financial reporting.

Item
13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
 and Director Independence.

Certain
Relationships and Related Transactions

The
following includes a summary of transactions since the beginning of fiscal 2018 or any currently proposed transaction
 in which
we were or are to be a participant and the amount involved exceeded or exceeds the lesser of $120
000 or one percent of the average
of our total assets at year end for the last two completed fiscal years and in which any related person had or will have a direct
or indirect material interest (other than compensation described under &ldquo;Executive Compensation&rdquo;). We believe the terms
obtained or consideration that we paid or received
 as applicable
 in connection with the transactions described below were comparable
to or better than terms available or the amounts that would be paid or received
 as applicable
 in arm&rsquo;s-length transactions.

The
Company&rsquo;s policy with regard to related party transactions requires any related party loans that are (i) non-interest bearing
and in excess of $100
000 or (ii) interest bearing
 irrespective of amount
 must be approved by the Company&rsquo;s board of directors.
All issuances of securities by the Company must be approved by the board of directors
 irrespective of whether the recipient is
a related party. Each of the foregoing transactions
 if required by its terms
 was approved in this manner.

Director
Independence

We
use the definition of &ldquo;independence&rdquo; standards as defined in the NASDAQ Stock Market Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that
an &ldquo;independent director&rdquo; is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual having
a relationship
 which
 in the opinion of the Company&rsquo;s board of directors
 would interfere with the exercise of independent
judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. We have determined as of December 31
 2018 that five
of our seven directors are independent
 which constitutes a majority.

Item

Audit
Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures

Under
the SEC&rsquo;s rules
 an audit committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent
registered public accounting firm in order to ensure that they do not impair the auditors&rsquo; independence. The SEC&rsquo;s
rules specify the types of non-audit services that an independent auditor may not provide to its audit client and establish the
audit committee&rsquo;s responsibility for administration of the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm.
The Company has established an Audit Committee. Accordingly
 audit services and non-audit services described in this Item 14 were
pre-approved by an Audit Committee.

There
were no hours expended on the principal accountant&rsquo;s engagement to audit the registrant&rsquo;s financial statements for
the most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by persons other than the principal accountant&rsquo;s full-time
permanent employees.

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Barfresh Food Group
 Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of December
31
 2018 and 2017
 and the related consolidated statements of 
stockholders&rsquo; equity (deficit)
 and cash flows for the years then ended
 and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the &ldquo;financial statements&rdquo;). In our opinion
 the consolidated financial statements present fairly
 in all material
respects
 the financial position of Barfresh Food Group
 Inc. as of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for the years then ended
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

Basis
for Opinion

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) and are required to be independent with respect to Barfresh
Food Group
 Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether
due to error or fraud. Barfresh Food Group Inc. is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity&rsquo;s internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion.

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risk of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements
 whether
due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Note
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Barfresh
Food Group Inc.
 (&ldquo;we
&rdquo; &ldquo;us
&rdquo; &ldquo;our
&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) was incorporated on February
25
 2010 in the State of Delaware. We are engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of ready to blend beverages
 particularly
smoothies
 shakes and frappes.

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;).

Basis
of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and our wholly owned subsidiaries
 Barfresh
Inc. and Barfresh Corporation Inc. (formerly known as Smoothie
 Inc.). All inter-company balances and transactions among
the companies have been eliminated upon consolidation.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the years reported. Actual
results may differ from these estimates.

Concentration
of Credit Risk

The
amount of cash on deposit with financial institutions exceeds the $250
000 federally insured limit at December 31
 2018 and 2017.
However
 we believe that cash on deposit that exceeds $250
000 in the financial institutions is financially sound and the risk
of loss is minimal.

Fair
Value Measurement

Financial
Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) Topic 820

Measurements and Disclosures
 provides a comprehensive framework for measuring fair value and expands
disclosures which are required about fair value measurements. Specifically
 ASC 820 sets forth a definition of fair value and
establishes a hierarchy prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques
 giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets and liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable value inputs. ASC 820 defines the hierarchy
as follows:

Level
1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. The types of assets
and liabilities included in Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices
 such as equities listed
on the New York Stock Exchange.

Level
2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets
 but are either directly or indirectly observable as of the
reported date. The types of assets and liabilities in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or
contracts or priced with models using highly observable inputs.

Level
3 - Significant inputs to pricing that are unobservable as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included
in Level 3 are those with inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation
 such as complex and subjective models
and forecasts used to determine the fair value of financial transmission rights.

Our
financial instruments consist of cash
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable
 accrued expenses
 derivative liabilities
 and convertible
notes. The carrying value of our financial instruments approximates their fair value
 except for the derivative liability in which
carrying value is fair value.

Accounts
Receivable

Accounts
receivable are typically unsecured. Our credit policy calls for payment generally within 30 days. The credit worthiness of a customer
is evaluated prior to a sale. As of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 the company&rsquo;s allowance for doubtful accounts was
$61
788 and $0
 respectively. There was bad debt expense for the year ended December 31
 2018 of $61
788 and no bad debt expense
for the year ended December 31
 2017. The allowance was applied to certain receivable accounts which are over 95 days.


    
    




Inventory
consists of finished goods and is carried at the lower of cost or realizable value on a first in first out basis. The company
As
of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 the Company&rsquo;s inventory reserve was $31
237 and $0
 respectively.

Intangible
Assets

Intangible
assets are comprised of patents
 net of amortization and trademarks. The patent costs are being amortized over the life of the
patent

- Goodwill and Other
 the costs of internally developing other intangible assets
 such as patents
are expensed as incurred. However
 as allowed by ASC 350
 costs associated with the acquisition of patents from third parties
legal fees and similar costs relating to patents have been capitalized.

In
accordance with ASC 350 legal costs related to trademarks have been capitalized. We have determined that trademarks have an indeterminable
life and therefore are not being amortized.

Long-Lived
Assets and Other Acquired Intangible Assets

We
evaluate the recoverability of property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events
or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest
level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability
of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected
to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable
the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the
years presented.

Property
Plant
 and Equipment

Property
plant
 and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss
 if any. Depreciation is
calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are being amortized
over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term that includes any expected renewal periods that are deemed
to be reasonably assured. The estimated useful lives used for financial statement purposes are:

Furniture
and fixtures: 5 years
Manufacturing
equipment and customer equipment: 3 years to 7 years
Leasehold
improvements: 2 years
Vehicles
5 years

Revenue
Recognition

In
accordance with ASC 606
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains ownership of promised
goods. The Company adopted this standard at the beginning of fiscal year 2018
 with no significant impact to its financial position
or results of operations
 using the modified retrospective method. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration
to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods. The Company applies the following five steps:



    
    
Identify
    the contract with a customer

    
    
A
    contract with a customer exists when (i) the Company enters into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each
    party&rsquo;s rights
 (ii) the contract has commercial substance and
 (iii) the Company determines that collection of substantially
    all consideration for goods or services that are transferred is probable. For the Company
 the contract is the approved sales
    order
 which may also be supplemented by other agreements that formalize various terms and conditions with customers.

    
    
    

    
    
Identify
    the performance obligation in the contract

    
    
Performance
    obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or that will be transferred to the customer. For the
    Company
 this consists of the delivery of frozen beverages
 which provide immediate benefit to the customer.



    
    




    
    
Determine
    the transaction price

    
    
The
    transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring
    goods
 and is generally stated on the approved sales order. Variable consideration
 which typically includes volume-based
    rebates or discounts
 are estimated utilizing the most likely amount method.

    
    
    

    
    
Allocate
    the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract 
    delivery of frozen beverages
 the transaction price is allocated to that single performance obligation.

    
    
    

    
    
Recognize
    Revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation

    
    
The
    Company recognizes revenue from the sale of frozen beverages when title and risk of loss passes and the customer accepts the
    goods
 which generally occurs at delivery. Customer sales incentives such as volume-based rebates or discounts are treated
    as a reduction of sales at the time the sale is recognized. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and
    presented in distribution
 selling and administrative costs.

    
    
    

    
    
The
    company evaluated the requirement to disaggregate revenue
 and concluded that substantially all of its revenue comes from
    a single product
 frozen beverages.


Research
and Development

Expenditures
for research activities relating to product development and improvement are charged to expense as incurred. We incurred $674
224
and $574
989
 in research and development expenses for the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.

Shipping
and Storage Costs

Shipping
and handling costs are included in general and administrative expenses. For the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 shipping
and handling costs totaled $864
871 and $619
871
 respectively.

Rent
Expense

We
recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the reasonably assured lease term as defined in ASC Topic 840



Income
Taxes

The
provision for income taxes is determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740
 
(&ldquo;ASC 740&rdquo;). Under this method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

ASC
740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize
 measure
 present
 and disclose in their financial statements
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740
 tax positions must initially be recognized
in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50%
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant
facts.

ASC
740 requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight of evidence
 it is more
than likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized.

For
the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017 we did not have any interest and penalties or any significant unrecognized uncertain
tax positions.


    
    


Derivative
Liability

The
Company evaluates its convertible instruments
 options
 warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded
components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under ASC Topic 815
 &ldquo;Derivatives and
Hedging.&rdquo; The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of any derivative is marked-to-market each balance
sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability
 the change in fair value
is recorded in the statement of operations as gain/loss from derivative liability. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative
instrument
 the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity.
We analyzed the derivative financial instruments in accordance with ASC 815. The objective is to provide guidance for determining
whether an equity-linked financial instrument is indexed to an entity&rsquo;s own stock. This determination is needed for a scope
exception which would enable a derivative instrument to be accounted for under the accrual method. The classification of a non-derivative
instrument that falls within the scope of ASC 815-40-05 &ldquo;Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to
 and
Potentially Settled in
 a Company&rsquo;s Own Stock&rdquo; also hinges on whether the instrument is indexed to an entity&rsquo;s
own stock. A non-derivative instrument that is not indexed to an entity&rsquo;s own stock cannot be classified as equity and must
be accounted for as a liability. There is a two-step approach in determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed
to an entity&rsquo;s own stock. First
 the instrument&rsquo;s contingent exercise provisions
 if any
 must be evaluated
 followed
by an evaluation of the instrument&rsquo;s settlement provisions. The Company utilized the fair value standard set forth by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board
 defined as the amount at which the assets (or liability) could be bought (or incurred) or
sold (or settled) in a current transaction between willing parties
 that is
 other than in a forced or liquidation sale.

Earnings
per Share

We
calculate net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260
. Basic net loss per share is computed
by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period
 and diluted earnings
per share is computed by including common stock equivalents outstanding for the period in the denominator. At December 31
 2018
and 2017 any equivalents would have been anti-dilutive as we had losses for the periods then ended.

Stock
Based Compensation

We
calculate stock compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718
 (&ldquo;ASC 718&rdquo;).
ASC 718 requires that the cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and
establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires all entities
to apply a fair-value-based measurement method in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees except for equity
instruments held by employee stock ownership plans



Certain
reclassifications of amounts previously reported have been made to the accompanying consolidated financial statements to maintain
consistency between periods presented. The reclassifications had no impact on net income or stockholder&rsquo;s equity.

Recent
pronouncements

From
time to time
 new accounting pronouncements are issued that we adopt as of the specified effective date. We believe that the impact
of recently issued standards that are not yet effective may have an impact on our results of operations and financial position.

In
February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 &ldquo;Leases&rdquo;
 to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions.
This ASU will require organizations that lease assets (&ldquo;lessees&rdquo;) to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use
asset on its balance sheet for all leases with terms of more than twelve months. A lease liability is a lessee&rsquo;s obligation
to make lease payments arising from a lease
 measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset represents the lessee&rsquo;s
right to use
 or control use of
 a specified asset for the lease term. The amendments in this ASU leaves the accounting for the
organization that own the assets leased to the lessee (&ldquo;lessor&rdquo;) largely unchanged except for targeted improvements
to align it with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606
 &ldquo;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&rdquo;.

The
Based
on our evaluation
 we will have one material lease subject to adoption of this standard in our upcoming fiscal year. As disclosed
in Note 14
 we entered into a new office space lease that will take effect on April 1
 2019 and would expect to record a right-of-use
asset and corresponding liability for amounts that approximate our future commitments of approximately $300
000.

 2019.

The
amounts carried on the balance sheet represent cost to acquire
 legal fees and similar costs relating to the patents incurred
by the Company. Amortization is calculated through the expiration date of the patent
 which is December
 2025. The amount charged
to expenses for amortization of the patent costs was $63
610 and $62

5. Short-Term Notes Payable

In
March 2018
 we closed an offering of $250

Note
6. Convertible Notes (Related and Unrelated Party)

In
March 2018
 we closed an offering of $2
527
500 in convertible notes
 Series CN Note 1 of 2
 of which
 management
 directors and
significant shareholders have invested $840
000. The convertible notes bear 10% interest per annum and are due and payable on
March 14
 2020. The notes are convertible at any time prior to the due date into our common stock at conversion price of $0.88
per share or 85% of the average closing price of the common stock over the twenty consecutive trading days immediately preceding
the date of note holders&rsquo; election; but in no events lower than $0.60 per share. In addition
 the interest is convertible
at any time prior to the due dates into our common stock at conversion price of 85% of the average closing price of the common
stock over the twenty consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of note holders&rsquo; election; but in no event
lower than $0.60 per share. There were 1
331
583 warrants issued
 in conjunction with the convertible note offering.

The
fair value of the warrants
 $0.17 per share ($220
548 in the aggregate)
 was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model using the following assumptions:




Expected
    life (in years)
    

Volatility
    (based on a comparable company)
    

Risk
    Free interest rate
    

Dividend
    yield (on common stock)
    


The
value of $220
548 was recorded as a debt discount related to the issuance of the warrants.

In
April 2018
 we offered investors in our March 2018 Convertible Note (&ldquo;Series CN Notes&rdquo;) the opportunity to accelerate
the issuance of certain warrants associated with the CN Notes. Pursuant to the acceleration offer
 Series CN Notes investors who
invested an additional 10% to 20% of the Series CN Note amount
 immediately received an additional 25% warrant coverage on their
initial CN Note investment
 which would otherwise have been issued after one year. During April 2018
 we closed the CN Note acceleration
offer in the amount of $177
300 in convertible notes
 of which
 management
 directors and significant shareholders have invested
$30
000. The CN Note acceleration offer convertible notes bear 10% interest per annum and are due and payable on March 14
 2020.
The notes are convertible at any time prior to the due date into our common stock at conversion price of $0.88 per share or 85%
of the average closing price of the common stock over the twenty consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of note
holders&rsquo; election; but in no events lower than $0.60 per share. In addition
 the interest is convertible at any time prior
to the due dates into our common stock at conversion price of 85% of the average closing price of the common stock over the twenty
consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of note holders&rsquo; election; but in no events lower than $0.60 per
share. There were 937
373 warrants issued in conjunction with the Series CN Note acceleration offer convertible note offering.

The
fair value of the warrants
 $0.25 per share ($235
519 in the aggregate)
 was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model using the following assumptions:



Expected
    life (in years)

    (based on a comparable company)
    

Risk
    Free interest rate

The
value of $105
199 was recorded as a debt discount related to the issuance of the warrants as using the fair value would cause
the debt discount to exceed the gross proceeds received.

In
November and December 2018
 three investors elected to convert their convertible note issued on March 14
 2018 into stock. The
total debt converted was $453
000 and $30

Note
7. Derivative Liabilities

As
discussed in Note 6
 Convertible Notes
 the Company issued Series CN Note acceleration offer convertible notes payable that provide
variable conversion provisions. The conversion terms of the convertible notes are variable based on certain factors
 such as the
future price of the Company&rsquo;s common stock. The number of shares of common stock to be issued is based on the future price
of the Company&rsquo;s common stock
 therefore the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the promissory
note is indeterminate.

The
fair values of the Company&rsquo;s derivative liabilities are estimated at the issuance date and are revalued at each subsequent
reporting date. The Company recognized a derivative liability and debt discount of $569
588 at March 14
 2018 related to
the Series CN Convertible notes 1 of 2; $69
400 at April 11
 2018 related to the Series CN Notes Warrant Acceleration; and $697
186
at November 30
 2018 related to the Series CN Convertible note 2 of 2. The derivative liability was revalued at December 31
 2018
with a value of $1
325
653. The Company recorded a net loss of $87
630 for the year ended December 31
 2018 related to the derivative
liability. The net loss consists of a $110
829 gain for a portion of the derivative liability being settled upon a note holders
decision to convert their outstanding principal under the terms of the convertible note agreement to equity and a loss of $198
459
from the change in fair value.

The
fair value of the derivative liability for CN Convertible Note 1 of 2 and CN Note Warrant Acceleration was calculated using the
Black-Scholes model using the following assumptions.

ASC
740 requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight of evidence
 it is more
than likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized. After consideration of all the
evidence
 both positive and negative
 management has determined that a $7
969
000 and $6
902
200 allowance at December 31
 2018
and 2017
 respectively
 is necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.
The increase in the valuation allowance for the current period is $1
066
800.

As
of December 31
 2018
 we have a net operating loss carry forward of approximately $32
795

Note
13. Liquidity

We
have a history of operating losses and negative cash flow. As our operations grow
 we expect to experience significant increases
in our working capital requirements. These conditions raise substantial doubt over the Company&rsquo;s ability to meet all of
its obligations over the twelve months following the filing of this Form 10-K. Management has evaluated these conditions
 and
concluded that current plans will alleviate this concern. As of December 31
 2018
 we had $1
041
569 of cash on the balance
sheet. We have continued to significantly reduce core operating expenses
 reducing total General and Administrative Expense in
2018 by $1.7 million
 or 18%
 as compared with 2017. In addition
 in the first quarter of 2019
 the Company completed $4.3 million
of funding efforts. These efforts included a Private Placement Offering for common shares priced at .60 cents per share
 resulting
in the receipt of capital investment in the amount of $2.4 million and the issuance of 3
833
333 shares. In addition
 the Company
offered to reduce the exercise price on its I Warrants from $1 to .60 cents
 for a limited time. During the time this offer was
open
 I Warrant holders converted 2
841
454 warrants at .60 cents
 resulting in the receipt of capital investment in the amount
of $1.7 million. In addition
 during the first quarter of 2019
 one investor exercised G series warrants
 resulting in the receipt
of capital investment in the amount of $180
000. In addition
 during the first quarter of 2019
 the Company settled certain Executive
Deferred Compensation payments with a combination of cash and warrants. The total amount of Deferred Executive compensation settled
is $730
869. One-third of that total or $243
623
 was paid in cash. The remaining balance of $487
246 was settled by granting
the Executives warrants exercisable for five years to purchase the Company&rsquo;s stock at an exercise price of $0.70 per share
the closing price of our common stock on March 19
 2019
 resulting in additional cash savings to the Company. Management has concluded
that these actions have mitigated the substantial doubt of our ability to continue as a going concern. However
 the Company cannot
predict
 with certainty
 the outcome of its action to generate liquidity
 including the availability of additional financing
or whether such actions would generate the expect liquidity as planned.

Note
14. Subsequent Events

During
the first quarter of 2019
 the Company completed additional funding efforts
 including a Private Placement Offering for common
shares priced at $0.60 per share
 resulting in the receipt of proceeds in the amount of $2.4 million and the issuance of 3
833
333
shares. In addition
 during the first quarter of 2019
 the Company offered to reduce the exercise price on its I Warrants from
$1 to $0.60
 for a limited time. During the time this offer was open
 I Warrant holders converted 2
841
454 warrants at $0.60
resulting in the receipt of proceeds in the amount of $1.7 million. In addition
 during the first quarter of 2019
 one investor
exercised G series warrants
 resulting in the receipt of proceeds in the amount of $180
000
 and the issuance of 300
000 shares.
In total
 during the first quarter of 2019
 the Company has raised $4.3 million and issued 7
141
454 shares
 and no additional
warrants.

Effective
March 31
 2019
 the Company paid all outstanding Executive Deferred Compensation amounts. The total amount settled is $730
869
comprised of $603
294 outstanding at December 31
 2018
 and $127
575 additional deferrals recorded during the first quarter of
2019. One-third of the total outstanding Executive Deferred Compensation amount
 or $243
623
 was paid in cash. The remaining
balance was settled by granting the Executives a warrant exercisable for five years to purchase the Company&rsquo;s stock at an
exercise price of $0.70 per share
 the closing price of our common stock on March 19
 2019. The total number of the warrants issued
of 1
827
173 was determined using the Black Sholes valuation methodology
 and by placing a fifty percent premium on the cash value
of the remaining two thirds of total outstanding Executive Deferred Compensation as of March 31
 2019.

The
Company entered into an agreement to lease office space
 beginning April 1
 2019 through March 31
 2023. For the first twelve
months base rent is $6
175 with annual increases of approximately 3%.

 &lt;i&gt;Earnings per Share&lt;/i&gt;. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted&#13;average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period
 and diluted earnings per share is computed by including common&#13;stock equivalents outstanding for the period in the denominator. At December 31



 the FASB issued ASU&#13;No. 2016-02
 &amp;#8220;Leases&amp;#8221;
 to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. This ASU will require organizations&#13;that lease assets (&amp;#8220;lessees&amp;#8221;) to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on its balance sheet for all&#13;leases with terms of more than twelve months. A lease liability is a lessee&amp;#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from&#13;a lease
 measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset represents the lessee&amp;#8217;s right to use
 or control use of
&#13;a specified asset for the lease term. The amendments in this ASU leaves the accounting for the organization that own the assets&#13;leased to the lessee (&amp;#8220;lessor&amp;#8221;) largely unchanged except for targeted improvements to align it with the lessee accounting&#13;model and Topic 606

 we do not expect there to be material changes to both our&#13;current and long-term lease liabilities and our fixed assets of our limited number of operating leases that will be converted&#13;to financing leases under the new guidance. The Company does not plan to adopt the standard until the interim period ended March&#13;31

 we expect to experience significant increases in our working capital requirements.&#13;These conditions raise substantial doubt over the Company&amp;#8217;s ability to meet all of its obligations over the twelve months&#13;following the filing of this Form 10-K. Management has evaluated these conditions
 and concluded that current plans will alleviate&#13;this concern. As of December 31
 2018
 we had $1

569 of cash on the balance sheet. We have continued to significantly reduce&#13;core operating expenses
 reducing total General and Administrative Expense in 2018 by $1.7 million
 or 18%
 as compared with 2017.&#13;In addition
 in the first quarter of 2019
 the Company completed $4.3 million of funding efforts. These efforts included a Private&#13;Placement Offering for common shares priced at .60 cents per share
 resulting in the receipt of capital investment in the amount&#13;of $2.4 million and the issuance of 3

 during the first quarter of 2019
 the Company settled certain Executive Deferred Compensation payments with a combination&#13;of cash and warrants. The total amount of Deferred Executive compensation settled is $730

 the closing price of our common stock on March&#13;19
 2019

 options
 warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify&#13;as derivatives to be separately accounted for under ASC Topic 815
 &amp;#8220;Derivatives and Hedging.&amp;#8221; The result of this accounting&#13;treatment is that the fair value of any derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In&#13;the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability
 the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations&#13;as gain/loss from derivative liability. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument
 the instrument is marked to fair&#13;value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity. We analyzed the derivative financial instruments&#13;in accordance with ASC 815. The objective is to provide guidance for determining whether an equity-linked financial instrument&#13;is indexed to an entity&amp;#8217;s own stock. This determination is needed for a scope exception which would enable a derivative&#13;instrument to be accounted for under the accrual method. The classification of a non-derivative instrument that falls within the&#13;scope of ASC 815-40-05 &amp;#8220;Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to
 and Potentially Settled in
 a Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;Own Stock&amp;#8221; also hinges on whether the instrument is indexed to an entity&amp;#8217;s own stock. A non-derivative instrument&#13;that is not indexed to an entity&amp;#8217;s own stock cannot be classified as equity and must be accounted for as a liability. There&#13;is a two-step approach in determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity&amp;#8217;s own stock. First
&#13;the instrument&amp;#8217;s contingent exercise provisions
 if any
 must be evaluated
 followed by an evaluation of the instrument&amp;#8217;s&#13;settlement provisions. The Company utilized the fair value standard set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
 defined&#13;as the amount at which the assets (or liability) could be bought (or incurred) or sold (or settled) in a current transaction between&#13;willing parties

 options
 warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify&#13;as derivatives to be separately accounted for under ASC Topic 815
 &amp;#8220;Derivatives and Hedging.&amp;#8221; The result of this accounting&#13;treatment is that the fair value of any derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In&#13;the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability
 the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as&#13;gain/loss from derivative liability. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument
 the instrument is marked to fair value&#13;at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity. We analyzed the derivative financial instruments in&#13;accordance with ASC 815. The objective is to provide guidance for determining whether an equity-linked financial instrument is&#13;indexed to an entity&amp;#8217;s own stock. This determination is needed for a scope exception which would enable a derivative instrument&#13;to be accounted for under the accrual method. The classification of a non-derivative instrument that falls within the scope of&#13;ASC 815-40-05 &amp;#8220;Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to
 and Potentially Settled in
 a Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;Own Stock&amp;#8221; also hinges on whether the instrument is indexed to an entity&amp;#8217;s own stock. A non-derivative instrument that&#13;is not indexed to an entity&amp;#8217;s own stock cannot be classified as equity and must be accounted for as a liability. There is&#13;a two-step approach in determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity&amp;#8217;s own stock. First
&#13;the instrument&amp;#8217;s contingent exercise provisions
 if any
 must be evaluated
 followed by an evaluation of the instrument&amp;#8217;s&#13;settlement provisions. The Company utilized the fair value standard set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
 defined&#13;as the amount at which the assets (or liability) could be bought (or incurred) or sold (or settled) in a current transaction between&#13;willing parties
 that is

 &lt;i&gt;Earnings per Share&lt;/i&gt;. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average&#13;number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period
 and diluted earnings per share is computed by including common stock&#13;equivalents outstanding for the period in the denominator. At December 31



 the FASB issued ASU&#13;No. 2016-02
 &amp;#8220;Leases&amp;#8221;
 to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. This ASU will require organizations&#13;that lease assets (&amp;#8220;lessees&amp;#8221;) to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on its balance sheet for all&#13;leases with terms of more than twelve months. A lease liability is a lessee&amp;#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from&#13;a lease
 measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset represents the lessee&amp;#8217;s right to use
 or control use of
&#13;a specified asset for the lease term. The amendments in this ASU leaves the accounting for the organization that own the assets&#13;leased to the lessee (&amp;#8220;lessor&amp;#8221;) largely unchanged except for targeted improvements to align it with the lessee accounting&#13;model and Topic 606

 we do not expect there to be material changes to both our&#13;current and long-term lease liabilities and our fixed assets of our limited number of operating leases that will be converted&#13;to financing leases under the new guidance. The Company does not plan to adopt the standard until the interim period ended March&#13;31

 2018 and 2017. However
 we believe that cash on deposit
that exceeds $250
000 in the financial institutions is financially sound and the risk of loss is minimal.




(&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 820
 
(&#8220;ASC 820&#8221;)
 provides a comprehensive framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures which are required
about fair value measurements. Specifically
 ASC 820 sets forth a definition of fair value and establishes a hierarchy prioritizing
the inputs to valuation techniques
 giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable value inputs. ASC 820 defines the hierarchy as follows:


available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. The types of assets and liabilities included
in Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices
 such as equities listed on the New York Stock
Exchange.


other than quoted prices in active markets
 but are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The types
of assets and liabilities in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or contracts or priced with
models using highly observable inputs.


to pricing that are unobservable as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are those with
inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation
 such as complex and subjective models and forecasts used to determine
the fair value of financial transmission rights.


cash
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable
 accrued expenses
 derivative liabilities
 and convertible notes. The carrying value
of our financial instruments approximates their fair value
 except for the derivative liability in which carrying value is fair
value.




Our credit policy calls for payment generally within 30 days. The credit worthiness of a customer is evaluated prior to a sale.
As of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 the company&#8217;s allowance for doubtful accounts was $61
788 and $0
 respectively. There was
bad debt expense for the year ended December 31
 2018 of $61
788 and no bad debt expense for the year ended December 31
 2017.
The allowance was applied to certain receivable accounts which are over 95 days.




and is carried at the lower of cost or realizable value on a first in first out basis. The company monitors the remaining useful
life of its inventory and establishes a reserve of obsolescence where appropriate. As of December 31
 2018 and 2017
 the Company&#8217;s
inventory reserve was $31

 respectively.

and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows
are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison
of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that
the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable
 the carrying amount of such assets is reduced
to fair value. We have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented.

Property
 Plant
 and Equipment


 plant
 and equipment is stated
at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss
 if any. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are being amortized over the shorter of the useful life of
the asset or the lease term that includes any expected renewal periods that are deemed to be reasonably assured. The estimated
useful lives used for financial statement purposes are:


years

customer equipment: 3 years to 7 years

years





 Revenue
from Contracts with Customers
 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains ownership of promised goods. The Company adopted this
standard at the beginning of fiscal year 2018
 with no significant impact to its financial position or results of operations
 using
the modified retrospective method. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to
be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods. The Company applies the following five steps:



    
    
    

    
    
A contract with a customer exists when (i) the Company enters into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party&#8217;s rights
 (ii) the contract has commercial substance and
 (iii) the Company determines that collection of substantially all consideration for goods or services that are transferred is probable. For the Company
 the contract is the approved sales order
 which may also be supplemented by other agreements that formalize various terms and conditions with customers.

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or that will be transferred to the customer. For the Company
 this consists of the delivery of frozen beverages
 which provide immediate benefit to the customer.




    
    
    

    
    
The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods
 and is generally stated on the approved sales order. Variable consideration
 which typically includes volume-based rebates or discounts
 are estimated utilizing the most likely amount method.

    
    
    

    
    
Since our contracts contain a single performance obligation
 delivery of frozen beverages
 the transaction price is allocated to that single performance obligation.

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of frozen beverages when title and risk of loss passes and the customer accepts the goods
 which generally occurs at delivery. Customer sales incentives such as volume-based rebates or discounts are treated as a reduction of sales at the time the sale is recognized. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and presented in distribution
 selling and administrative costs.

    
    
    

    
    
The company evaluated the requirement to disaggregate revenue
 and concluded that substantially all of its revenue comes from a single product
 frozen beverages.





relating to product development and improvement are charged to expense as incurred. We incurred $674
224 and $574
989
 in research
and development expenses for the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 respectively.




in general and administrative expenses. For the years ended December 31
 2018 and 2017
 shipping and handling costs totaled $864
871
and $619
871
 respectively.




basis over the reasonably assured lease term as defined in ASC Topic 840
 




in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740
 (&#8220;ASC 740&#8221;). Under this method
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date.


for how companies should recognize
 measure
 present
 and disclose in their financial statements
 uncertain tax positions taken
or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740
 tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements
when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must
initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized
upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.


to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight of evidence
 it is more than likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized.


 2018
and 2017 we did not have any interest and penalties or any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions.




instruments
 options
 warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify
as derivatives to be separately accounted for under ASC Topic 815
 &#8220;Derivatives and Hedging.&#8221; The result of this accounting
treatment is that the fair value of any derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In
the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability
 the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as
gain/loss from derivative liability. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument
 the instrument is marked to fair value
at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity. We analyzed the derivative financial instruments in
accordance with ASC 815. The objective is to provide guidance for determining whether an equity-linked financial instrument is
indexed to an entity&#8217;s own stock. This determination is needed for a scope exception which would enable a derivative instrument
to be accounted for under the accrual method. The classification of a non-derivative instrument that falls within the scope of
ASC 815-40-05 &#8220;Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to
 and Potentially Settled in
 a Company&#8217;s
Own Stock&#8221; also hinges on whether the instrument is indexed to an entity&#8217;s own stock. A non-derivative instrument that
is not indexed to an entity&#8217;s own stock cannot be classified as equity and must be accounted for as a liability. There is
a two-step approach in determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity&#8217;s own stock. First
the instrument&#8217;s contingent exercise provisions
 if any
 must be evaluated
 followed by an evaluation of the instrument&#8217;s
settlement provisions. The Company utilized the fair value standard set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
 defined
as the amount at which the assets (or liability) could be bought (or incurred) or sold (or settled) in a current transaction between
willing parties
 that is
 other than in a forced or liquidation sale.




with ASC Topic 260
. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period
 and diluted earnings per share is computed by including common stock
equivalents outstanding for the period in the denominator. At December 31
 2018 and 2017 any equivalents would have been anti-dilutive
as we had losses for the periods then ended.




with ASC Topic 718
 (&#8220;ASC 718&#8221;). ASC 718 requires that the cost resulting
from all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement
objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair-value-based measurement
method in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees except for equity instruments held by employee stock ownership
plans




previously reported have been made to the accompanying consolidated financial statements to maintain consistency between periods
presented. The reclassifications had no impact on net income or stockholder&#8217;s equity.




 new accounting pronouncements
are issued that we adopt as of the specified effective date. We believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not
yet effective may have an impact on our results of operations and financial position.


 the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-02
 &#8220;Leases&#8221;
 to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. This ASU will require organizations
that lease assets (&#8220;lessees&#8221;) to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on its balance sheet for all
leases with terms of more than twelve months. A lease liability is a lessee&#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from
a lease
 measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset represents the lessee&#8217;s right to use
 or control use of
a specified asset for the lease term. The amendments in this ASU leaves the accounting for the organization that own the assets
leased to the lessee (&#8220;lessor&#8221;) largely unchanged except for targeted improvements to align it with the lessee accounting
model and Topic 606
 &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&#8221;.


of the standard on our financial statements. Based on our evaluation
 we do not expect there to be material changes to both our
current and long-term lease liabilities and our fixed assets of our limited number of operating leases that will be converted
to financing leases under the new guidance. The Company does not plan to adopt the standard until the interim period ended March
31
 2019.

 Convertible
Notes
 the Company issued Series CN Note acceleration offer convertible notes payable that provide variable conversion provisions.
The conversion terms of the convertible notes are variable based on certain factors
 such as the future price of the Company&#8217;s
common stock. The number of shares of common stock to be issued is based on the future price of the Company&#8217;s common stock
therefore the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the promissory note is indeterminate.

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]









and negative cash flow. As our operations grow
 we expect to experience significant increases in our working capital requirements.
These conditions raise substantial doubt over the Company&#8217;s ability to meet all of its obligations over the twelve months
following the filing of this Form 10-K. Management has evaluated these conditions
 and concluded that current plans will alleviate
this concern. As of December 31
 2018
 we had $1
041
569 of cash on the balance sheet. We have continued to significantly reduce
core operating expenses
 reducing total General and Administrative Expense in 2018 by $1.7 million
 or 18%
 as compared with 2017.
In addition
 in the first quarter of 2019
 the Company completed $4.3 million of funding efforts. These efforts included a Private
Placement Offering for common shares priced at .60 cents per share
 resulting in the receipt of capital investment in the amount
of $2.4 million and the issuance of 3
833
333 shares. In addition
 the Company offered to reduce the exercise price on its I Warrants
from $1 to .60 cents
 for a limited time. During the time this offer was open
 I Warrant holders converted 2
841
454 warrants
at .60 cents
 resulting in the receipt of capital investment in the amount of $1.7 million. In addition
 during the first quarter
of 2019
 one investor exercised G series warrants
 resulting in the receipt of capital investment in the amount of $180
000. In
addition
 during the first quarter of 2019
 the Company settled certain Executive Deferred Compensation payments with a combination
of cash and warrants. The total amount of Deferred Executive compensation settled is $730
869. One-third of that total or $243
623
was paid in cash. The remaining balance of $487
246 was settled by granting the Executives warrants exercisable for five years
to purchase the Company&#8217;s stock at an exercise price of $0.70 per share
 the closing price of our common stock on March
19
 2019
 resulting in additional cash savings to the Company. Management has concluded that these actions have mitigated the
substantial doubt of our ability to continue as a going concern. However
 the Company cannot predict
 with certainty
 the outcome
of its action to generate liquidity
 including the availability of additional financing
 or whether such actions would generate
the expect liquidity as planned.

 the Company
completed additional funding efforts
 including a Private Placement Offering for common shares priced at $0.60 per share
 resulting
in the receipt of proceeds in the amount of $2.4 million and the issuance of 3
833
333 shares. In addition
 during the first quarter

 during the first quarter of 2019
 one investor exercised G series warrants
 resulting in the receipt
of proceeds in the amount of $180

 and the issuance of 300
000 shares. In total
 during the first quarter of 2019
 the Company
has raised $4.3 million and issued 7
141
454 shares
 and no additional warrants.


 2019
 the Company paid
all outstanding Executive Deferred Compensation amounts. The total amount settled is $730
869
 comprised of $603
294 outstanding
at December 31
 2018
 and $127
575 additional deferrals recorded during the first quarter of 2019. One-third of the total outstanding
Executive Deferred Compensation amount
 or $243
623
 was paid in cash. The remaining balance was settled by granting the Executives
a warrant exercisable for five years to purchase the Company&#8217;s stock at an exercise price of $0.70 per share
 the closing
price of our common stock on March 19
 2019. The total number of the warrants issued of 1
827
173 was determined using the Black
Sholes valuation methodology
 and by placing a fifty percent premium on the cash value of the remaining two thirds of total outstanding
Executive Deferred Compensation as of March 31
 2019.

(&#8220;ASC 820&#8221;)
 provides a comprehensive framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures which are required
about fair value measurements. Specifically
 ASC 820 sets forth a definition of fair value and establishes a hierarchy prioritizing
the inputs to valuation techniques
 giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable value inputs. ASC 820 defines the hierarchy as follows:


available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. The types of assets and liabilities included
in Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices
 such as equities listed on the New York Stock
Exchange.


other than quoted prices in active markets
 but are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The types
of assets and liabilities in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or contracts or priced with
models using highly observable inputs.


to pricing that are unobservable as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are those with
inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation
 such as complex and subjective models and forecasts used to determine
the fair value of financial transmission rights.

and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows
are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison
of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that
the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable
 the carrying amount of such assets is
reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented.

 Revenue
from Contracts with Customers
 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains ownership of promised goods. The Company adopted this
standard at the beginning of fiscal year 2018
 with no significant impact to its financial position or results of operations
 using
the modified retrospective method. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to
be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods. The Company applies the following five steps:



    
    
    

    
    
A contract with a customer exists when (i) the Company enters into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party&#8217;s rights
 (ii) the contract has commercial substance and
 (iii) the Company determines that collection of substantially all consideration for goods or services that are transferred is probable. For the Company
 the contract is the approved sales order
 which may also be supplemented by other agreements that formalize various terms and conditions with customers.

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or that will be transferred to the customer. For the Company
 this consists of the delivery of frozen beverages
 which provide immediate benefit to the customer.




    
    
    

    
    
The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods
 and is generally stated on the approved sales order. Variable consideration
 which typically includes volume-based rebates or discounts
 are estimated utilizing the most likely amount method.

    
    
    

    
    
Since our contracts contain a single performance obligation
 delivery of frozen beverages
 the transaction price is allocated to that single performance obligation.

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of frozen beverages when title and risk of loss passes and the customer accepts the goods
 which generally occurs at delivery. Customer sales incentives such as volume-based rebates or discounts are treated as a reduction of sales at the time the sale is recognized. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and presented in distribution
 selling and administrative costs.

    
    
    

    
    
The company evaluated the requirement to disaggregate revenue
 and concluded that substantially all of its revenue comes from a single product
 frozen beverages.

basis over the reasonably assured lease term as defined in ASC Topic 840
 








in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740
 (&#8220;ASC 740&#8221;). Under this method
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date.


for how companies should recognize
 measure
 present
 and disclose in their financial statements
 uncertain tax positions taken
or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740
 tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements
when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must
initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized
upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.


to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight of evidence
 it is more than likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized.


 2018
and 2017 we did not have any interest and penalties or any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions.








instruments
 options
 warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify
as derivatives to be separately accounted for under ASC Topic 815
 &#8220;Derivatives and Hedging.&#8221; The result of this accounting
treatment is that the fair value of any derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In
the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability
 the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations
as gain/loss from derivative liability. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument
 the instrument is marked to fair
value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity. We analyzed the derivative financial instruments
in accordance with ASC 815. The objective is to provide guidance for determining whether an equity-linked financial instrument
is indexed to an entity&#8217;s own stock. This determination is needed for a scope exception which would enable a derivative
instrument to be accounted for under the accrual method. The classification of a non-derivative instrument that falls within the
scope of ASC 815-40-05 &#8220;Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to
 and Potentially Settled in
 a Company&#8217;s
Own Stock&#8221; also hinges on whether the instrument is indexed to an entity&#8217;s own stock. A non-derivative instrument
that is not indexed to an entity&#8217;s own stock cannot be classified as equity and must be accounted for as a liability. There
is a two-step approach in determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity&#8217;s own stock. First
the instrument&#8217;s contingent exercise provisions
 if any
 must be evaluated
 followed by an evaluation of the instrument&#8217;s
settlement provisions. The Company utilized the fair value standard set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
 defined
as the amount at which the assets (or liability) could be bought (or incurred) or sold (or settled) in a current transaction between
willing parties
 that is
 other than in a forced or liquidation sale.








accordance with ASC Topic 260
. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period
 and diluted earnings per share is computed by including common
stock equivalents outstanding for the period in the denominator. At December 31
 2018 and 2017 any equivalents would have been
anti-dilutive as we had losses for the periods then ended.








accordance with ASC Topic 718
 (&#8220;ASC 718&#8221;). ASC 718 requires that the
cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value
as the measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair-value-based
measurement method in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees except for equity instruments held by employee
stock ownership plans








previously reported have been made to the accompanying consolidated financial statements to maintain consistency between periods
presented. The reclassifications had no impact on net income or stockholder&#8217;s equity.








 new accounting pronouncements
are issued that we adopt as of the specified effective date. We believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not
yet effective may have an impact on our results of operations and financial position.


 the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-02
 &#8220;Leases&#8221;
 to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. This ASU will require organizations
that lease assets (&#8220;lessees&#8221;) to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on its balance sheet for all
leases with terms of more than twelve months. A lease liability is a lessee&#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from
a lease
 measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset represents the lessee&#8217;s right to use

The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.
