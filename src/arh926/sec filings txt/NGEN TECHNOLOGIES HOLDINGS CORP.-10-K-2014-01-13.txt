Liberated Energy
 Inc. is a Nevada corporation formed on September 14
 2011.&#160;&#160;We were incorporated as Mega World Food Holding Company for the purpose of selling frozen vegetable products in all areas of the world except China.


On January 19
 2013
 pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement
 dated January 7
 2013
 Perpetual Wind Power Corporation
 a privately held corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 1
 2010
 acquired 24
500
000 non-registered shares of the Company from its shareholders
 thereby owning 24
500
000 out of a total of 25
000
000 issued and outstanding shares of the Company. Thereafter
 the Company acquired from Perpetual Wind Power Corporation its patented wind and solar powered turbine technology for 2
500
000 newly issued shares of the Company which were distributed in a dividend to its shareholders and Perpetual Wind Power Corporation returned to treasury its 24
500
000 shares it acquired from the Company's shareholders. As a result of this transaction
 the Company had on January 19
 2013
 3
000
000 shares issued and outstanding. On February 14
 2013
 the Company changed its name from Mega World Food Holding Company to Liberated Energy
 Inc. and underwent a 24 for 1 stock split
 whereby the Company's outstanding shares increased from 3
000
000 to 72
000
000.



Our goal is to develop new products related to alternative energy and bring them to the marketplace.&#160;&#160;Our primary areas of focus are in the areas of (1) wind energy for home and commercial use
 (2) wind and solar energy for outdoor illumination for home
 commercial and municipal use
 (3) electromagnetic energy applications
 and (4) an additive to convert water into a high BTU energy source.






On January 19
 2013
 the Company disposed of its wholly-owned subsidiary
 Mega World Food Limited (HK).&#160;&#160;Mega World Food Limited (HK) was incorporated on June 24
 2010 and was in the business of selling frozen vegetables in all areas of the world except China.&#160;&#160;From inception
 Mega World Food Limited (HK) only incurred setting up
 formation or organization activities.&#160;&#160;Upon disposal
 the Company ceased these operations and accordingly
 the Company&#8217;s financial statements have been prepared with the net assets
 results of operations

We do not have any employees.&#160;&#160;Frank Pringle is our Chief Executive Officer
 President
 and Chairman of the Board and Elyse Thompson is our Chief Financial Officer and Secretary.&#160;&#160;Besides our officers
 our management expects to use consultants
 attorneys
 and accountants as necessary
 and do not anticipate a need to engage any other full-time employees until absolutely necessary for the operations of our Company. The need for employees and their availability will be addressed in connection with the scope and requirements of the operations of the Company.











We have never paid dividends. We do not intend to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future. We presently intend to retain earnings
 if any
 for the development and expansion of our business.





We are a public company and file annual
 quarterly and special reports and other information with the SEC. We are not required to
 and do not intend to
 deliver an annual report to security holders. You may read and copy any document we file at the SEC&#8217;s public reference room at 100 F Street
 N.E.
 Washington
 D.C. 20549. You can request copies of these documents by writing to the SEC and paying a fee for the copying cost. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for more information about the operation of the public reference room. Our filings are also available
 at no charge
 to the public at 





In addition to the other information in this report
 the following risks should be considered carefully in evaluating our business and prospects:


We are a development stage company and have history of losses since our inception.&#160;&#160;If we cannot reverse our losses
 we will have to discontinue operations.


At September 30
 2013
 we had $44
684 in cash on hand and an accumulated deficit of $(168
294)
 causing our auditors to express their doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We anticipate incurring losses in the near future.&#160;&#160;We do not have an established source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs.&#160;&#160;Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully compete
 operate profitably and/or raise additional capital through other means. If we are unable to reverse our losses
 we will have to discontinue operations.








As of September 30
 2013
 we had $44
684 in cash and cash equivalents on hand and an accumulated deficit of $(168
294).


As of September 30
 2013
 we had Loans from Stockholders in the amount of $28
116.




















All notes from related parties are payable upon demand. We believe that our cash from borrowings will be insufficient to fund our operations and to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs for the next twelve months.&#160;&#160;We will required to seek additional financing in the future to respond to increased expenses or shortfalls in anticipated revenues
 respond to competitive pressures or take advantage of unanticipated acquisition opportunities. We cannot be certain we will be able to find such additional financing on reasonable terms
 or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional financing when needed
 we could be required to modify our business plan in accordance with the extent of available financing.





We currently do not have an external credit facility.&#160;&#160;The current economic recession has hampered small businesses
 like ours
 from obtaining loans and lines of credit from banks and lending agencies.&#160;&#160;Overall
 due to the recession and increasing bank failures
 banks have become more selective when granting loans and/or lines of credit to businesses and individuals.&#160;&#160;If we are unable to grow our business from generating revenues
 we may need access to additional capital such as loans and/or lines of credit.&#160;&#160;We might not qualify for such loans and/or lines of credit. Our failure to secure an external credit facility could prevent us from growing our business or to cease operations.





We will need additional funding which may not be available when needed. We estimate that we will need $75
000 to continue our operations for the next 12 months.&#160;&#160;If we are able to raise additional funds and by issuing equity securities
 you may experience significant dilution of your ownership interest and holders of these securities may have rights senior to those of the holders of our common stock. If we obtain additional financing by issuing debt securities
 the terms of these securities could restrict or prevent us from paying dividends and could limit our flexibility in making business decisions. In this case
 the value of your investment could be reduced.


We are highly dependent on our two executive officers
 Frank Pringle and Elyse Thompson.&#160;&#160;The loss of either of them would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.


We currently have only two executive officers
 Frank Pringle and Elyse Thompson.&#160;&#160;Frank Pringle serves as our Chief Executive Officer
 President and Chairman of the Board
 and Elyse Thompson serves as our Chief Financial Officer. The loss of either executive officer could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.


If we cannot attract
 retain
 motivate and integrate additional skilled personal
 our ability to compete will be impaired.


The Company has no employees and many of our current and potential competitors have employees. Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract
 retain and motivate highly qualified management and technical personnel. We face intense competition for qualified personnel. The industry in which we compete has a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel. If we are unable to continue to employ our key personnel or to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future
 our ability to successfully execute our business plan will be jeopardized and our growth will be inhibited.


Our employees may be bound by confidentiality and other nondisclosure agreements regarding the trade secrets of their former employers. As a result
 our employees or we could be subject to allegations of trade secret violations and other similar violations if claims are made that they breached these agreements.


If we engage in acquisitions
 we may experience significant costs and difficulty assimilating the operations or personnel of the acquired companies
 which could threaten our future growth.


If we make any acquisitions
 we could have difficulty assimilating the operations
 technologies and products acquired or integrating or retaining personnel of acquired companies. In addition
 acquisitions may involve entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience. The occurrence of any one or more of these factors could disrupt our ongoing business
 distract our management and employees and increase our expenses. In addition
 pursuing acquisition opportunities could divert our management's attention from our ongoing business operations and result in decreased operating performance. Moreover
 our profitability may suffer because of acquisition-related costs or amortization of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. Furthermore
 we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities in future acquisitions. The issuance of equity securities would dilute our existing stockholders.


















Because our officers and directors are indemnified against certain losses
 we may be exposed to costs associated with litigation.


If our directors or officers become exposed to liabilities invoking the indemnification provisions
 we could be exposed to additional none reimbursable costs
 including legal fees. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws provide that our directors and officers will not be liable to us or to any shareholder and will be indemnified and held harmless for any consequences of any act or omission by the directors and officers unless the act or omission constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct. Extended or protracted litigation could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow.





The SEC has adopted regulations concerning low-priced stock
 or &#8220;penny stocks.&#8221; The regulations generally define penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share
 subject to certain exceptions. If our shares are offered at a market price less than $5.00 per share
 and do not qualify for any exemption from the penny stock regulations
 our shares may become subject to these additional regulations relating to low-priced stocks.


The penny stock regulations require that broker-dealers
 who recommend penny stocks to persons other than institutional accredited investors make a special suitability determination for the purchaser
 receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale and provide the purchaser with risk disclosure documents that identify risks associated with investing in penny stocks. Furthermore
 the broker-dealer must obtain a signed and dated acknowledgment from the purchaser demonstrating that the purchaser has actually received the required risk disclosure document before effecting a transaction in penny stock. These requirements have historically resulted in reducing the level of trading activity in securities that become subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these penny stock requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in the common stock
 which could severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and our shareholders' ability to sell our common stock in the secondary market.


We face intense competition
 which may adversely affect our industry unit share position
 revenue
 and profitability.


We operate in an industry in which there are rapid technological advances in hardware
 software
 and service offerings
 and we face aggressive product and price competition from both branded and generic competitors.&#160;&#160;We compete based on our ability to offer to our customers competitive open
 capable
 affordable
 and integrated solutions that provide the most current and desired product and services features.&#160;&#160;We expect that competition will continue to be intense
 and there is a risk our competitors&#8217; products may be less costly
 provide better performance or include additional features when compared to our products.&#160;&#160;Moreover
 our efforts to balance our mix of products and services to optimize profitability
 liquidity
 and growth may put pressure on our industry unit share position.


In addition to competitive factors we face as a result of the current state of our business and our industry
 we confront additional competitive challenges as our business and industry continue to grow and evolve. As we expand globally
 we may see new and increased competition in different geographic regions. Moreover
 the generally low barriers to entry in our business increase the potential for challenges from new industry competitors.&#160;&#160;We may also see increased competition from new types of products as the options for alternative energy solutions increase. Further
 as our industry evolves and our company grows
 companies with which we have strategic alliances may become competitors in other product areas or our current competitors may enter into new strategic relationships with new or existing competitors
 all of which may further increase the competitive pressures we face.


If our cost efficiency measures are not successful
 we may become less competitive.


We continue to focus on minimizing our operating expenses through cost improvements and simplifying our structure.&#160;&#160;However
 certain factors may prevent the achievement of these goals
 which may in turn negatively affect our competitive position. For example
 we may experience delays or unanticipated costs in implementing our cost efficiency plans.&#160;&#160;As a result
 we may not achieve our expected cost efficiencies in the time anticipated
 or at all.






















Our growth strategy involves reaching more customers through new distribution channels
 expanding our relationships with resellers
 and augmenting select areas of our business through targeted acquisitions and other commercial arrangements.&#160;&#160;As we reach more customers through new distribution channels and expanded reseller relationships
 we may fail to manage in an effective manner the increasingly difficult tasks of inventory management and demand forecasting.&#160;&#160;Our ability to accomplish the goals of our growth strategy depends on our success in transitioning our sales capabilities in accordance with our strategy
 adding to the breadth of our higher margin offerings through selective acquisitions of other businesses
 and managing the effects of these strategic initiatives. If we are unable to meet these challenges
 our results of operations could be unfavorably affected.


Our inability to manage solutions
 product
 and services transitions in an effective manner could reduce the demand for our solutions
 products and services and the profitability of our operations.

Continuing improvements in technology result in frequent new solutions
 product
 and services introductions
 short product life cycles
 and improvements in product performance characteristics.&#160;&#160;If we cannot manage in an effective manner the transition to new solutions offerings and these offerings&#8217; new products and services
 customer demand for our solutions
 products and services could diminish and our profitability could suffer.&#160;&#160;We are increasingly sourcing new products and transitioning existing products through our contract manufacturers and manufacturing outsourcing relationships in order to generate cost efficiencies
 deliver products faster
 and better serve our customers.&#160;&#160;The success of product transitions depends on a number of factors that include the availability of sufficient quantities of components at attractive costs.&#160;&#160;In addition
 product transitions present execution challenges and risks
 including the risk that new or upgraded products may have quality issues or other defects.


If we fail to achieve favorable pricing from our vendors
 our profitability could be adversely affected.


Our potential profitability is affected by our ability to achieve favorable pricing from our vendors and contract manufacturers
 including through negotiations for vendor rebates
 marketing funds
 and other vendor funding received in the normal course of business. Because these supplier negotiations are continuous and reflect the ongoing competitive environment
 the variability in timing and amount of incremental vendor discounts and rebates can affect our profitability. These vendor programs may change periodically
 potentially resulting in adverse profitability trends if we cannot adjust pricing or cost variables. Our inability to establish a cost and product advantage
 or determine alternative means to deliver value to our customers
 may adversely affect our industry unit share position
 revenue
 and profitability.






As a smaller reporting company
 we are not required to include disclosure under this item.

We believe it is important to communicate our expectations. However
 there may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or over which we have no control. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors
 including those set forth under Risk Factors, Business and elsewhere in this prospectus. See Risk Factors.























The following discussion and analysis is based on the audited financial statements for the years ended September 30
 2013 of Liberated Energy
 Inc.
 a Nevada corporation (&#8220;Liberated&#8221; the &#8220;Company
&#8221; &#8220;our
&#8221; or &#8220;we&#8221;). All significant inter-company amounts have been eliminated. In the opinion of management
 the audited financial statements presented herein reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for fair presentation. Interim results are not necessary indicative of results to be expected for the entire year.


We prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
 which require that management make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. Actual results could differ from these estimates.


Certain of the statements contained below are forward-looking statements (rather than historical facts) that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. We have limited assets of $54
684 as of September 30
 2013.





The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments
 assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. However
 future events are subject to change
 and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment. The amounts of assets and liabilities reported in our balance sheet
 and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each of our fiscal periods
 are affected by estimates and assumptions which are used for
 but not limited to
 the accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts
 goodwill and intangible asset impairments
 restructurings
 inventory and income taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The following critical accounting policies are significantly affected by judgments
 assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.





It is important to note that when preparing the financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
 management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes.&#160;&#160;Actual results could differ if those estimates and assumptions approve to be incorrect.


On an ongoing basis
 we evaluate our estimates
 including those related to estimated customer life
 used to determine the appropriate amortization period for deferred revenue and deferred costs associated with licensing fees
 the useful lives of property and equipment and our estimates of the value of common stock for the purpose of determining stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.





The Company recognizes revenues in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) number 104
 Revenue Recognition. SAB 104 clarifies application of U. S. generally accepted accounting principles to revenue transactions. As of the year ended September 30
 2013
 there was no deferred revenue. The Company derives its primary revenue from the sources described below
 which includes sale of alternative energy devices.























We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition
 changes in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.





For purposes of the statement of cash flows
 the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes.





Comparison of the Fiscal Years Ended September 30
 2013 and 2012

. The Company had no revenue during the fiscal year ended September 30
 2013
 and during fiscal year ended September 30
 2012.


.&#160;&#160;The Company incurred general
 and administrative expenses of $167
877 during the fiscal year ended September 30
 2013 compared to $0 during the fiscal year ended September 30
 2012.&#160;&#160;Such increase was due primarily to the higher professional fees and stock transfer agent fees as we are now a reporting company.


.&#160;&#160;As a result of the Company's general and administrative expenses
 the Company incurred an operating loss of $167
877 for the fiscal year ended September 30
 2013 as compared with $0 for the fiscal year ended September 30
 2012.


.&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s interest expense was $417 for the year ended September 30
 2013 as compared with $0 of interest expense for the fiscal year ended September 30
 2012.


.&#160;&#160;As a result
 the Company incurred a net loss of $168
294 during the year ended September 30
 2013 compared to a net loss of $0 during the year ended September 30
 2012.





In their Independent Auditor's Report for the fiscal years ending September 30
 2013
 Enterprise CPA
 Ltd. stated that several conditions and events cast substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a &#8220;going concern.&#8221;&#160;&#160;At September 30
 2013
 we had $44
684 cash on hand and $10
000 in prepaid expenses. We have incurred a deficit of $(167
877) from our inception to September 30
 2013. See &#8220;Liquidity and Capital resources.&#8221;





In their September 30
 2013 audit report
 our auditors have expressed their doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.&#160;&#160;Our primary source of liquidity has been from borrowing funds from certain executive officers and principal stockholders related to certain of our executive officers. As of September 30
 2013
 we had $44
684 in cash and cash equivalents. Our net loss for fiscal year ended September 30
 2013 were $(71
921).&#160;&#160;The accumulated deficit as of September 30
 2013 was $ (163
044).


As of September 30
 2013
 the Company owed $28
116 in Loans from Stockholders.&#160;&#160;These amounts are non-interest bearing.




















To date
 we have had no revenues; and we require additional financing in order to finance our business activities on an ongoing basis.&#160;&#160;Our future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors including
 but not limited to
 continued progress in getting financing to finance our projects. We are actively pursuing alternative financing and have had discussions with various third parties
 although no firm commitments have been obtained to date.&#160;&#160;In the interim
 shareholders of the Company have committed to meet our minimal operating expenses.&#160;&#160;We believe that actions presently being taken to revise our operating and financial requirements provide them with the opportunity to continue as a &#8220;going concern
&#8221; although no assurances can be given.



Pursuant to Patent Acquisition Agreement signed on January 19
 2013 between the Company and Perpetual Wind Power Corporation (the &#8220;Seller&#8221;)
 a privately held company organized in the State of Delaware
 Seller agrees to sell to the Company and the Company agrees to purchase from the Seller the perpetual wind patent for an aggregate purchase price of 2
500
000 newly issued common stock of the Company with par value of $0.001 to be issued to the Seller&#8217;s shareholders.&#160;&#160;Seller also agrees as additional consideration at the closing date to return the Company&#8217;s treasury the 24
500
000 shares of common stock with the par value of $0.001.



The Company used the par value method to record the patent acquisition transaction.&#160;&#160;The management estimated that the patent acquisition transaction is in good faith and with mutually agreed price which represents the fair value of the patent.&#160;&#160;Due to there were no active stock trading activities
 the trading price for the Company may not represent the fair value of the patent.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 the Company recorded the total patent of $2500
 and returned treasury stocks of $24
500.&#160;&#160;Due to the limited stock market activities and limited access of a pending patent application
 there might be uncertainty about the patent valuation.&#160;&#160;The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.






Our board of directors is authorized to issue 100
000
000 shares of Common stock

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30

 2012
AND FOR THE PERIOD FROM JUNE 24
 2010
(DATE OF INCEPTION) TO SEPTEMBER 30
 2013






























Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm &#8211; Enterprise CPA
 Ltd.

























































































































Board of Directors and Shareholders of Liberated Energy
 Inc.



We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Liberated Energy
 Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;)
 as of September 30
 2013
 and 2012
 and the related statements of operation
 shareholders&#8217; equity
 and cash flows for year ended September 30
 2013
 and 2012
&#160;&#160;and the cumulative period from January 19
 2013 (date of inception of development stage) through September 30
 2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management.&#160;&#160;Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).&#160;&#160;Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.&#160;&#160;An audit includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.&#160;&#160;An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.&#160;&#160;We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


As discussed in Note 10
 Patent Acquisition
 the Company used the par value method to record the patent acquisition transaction.&#160;&#160;The management estimated that the patent acquisition transaction is in good faith and with mutually agreed price which represents the fair value of the patent.&#160;&#160;Due to there were no active stock trading activities
 the trading price for the Company may not represent the fair value of the patent.&#160;&#160;Due to the limited stock market activities and limited access of a pending patent application
 there might be uncertainty about the patent valuation.&#160;&#160;The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.


In our opinion
 except for the effects of such adjustments
 if any
 as might have been determined to be necessary had we been able to examine evidence regarding the valuation of patent acquisition
 the financial statements referred to in the first paragraph above
 present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of Liberated Energy
 Inc. as of September 30
 2013
 2012
 and the results of its operations and their cash flows for year ended September 30
 2013
 and 2012
 and the cumulative period from January 19 (date of inception of development stage) through September 30
 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.



The Company&#8217;s lack of operating history and financial resources raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.&#160;&#160;The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and if the Company is unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing
 then the Company may be required to cease or curtail its operations.

LIBERATED ENERGY
 INC.



FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30
 2013 AND 2012









Liberated Energy
 Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;)
 formerly known as Mega World Food Holdings Company is a Nevada corporation formed on September 14
 2010.

On January 19
 2013
 pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement
 dated January 7
 2013
 Perpetual Wind Power Corporation
 a privately held corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 1
 2010
 acquired 24
500
000 non-registered shares of the Company from its shareholders
 thereby owning 24
500
000 out of a total of 25
000
000 issued and outstanding shares of the Company. Thereafter
 the Company acquired from Perpetual Wind Power Corporation its patented wind and solar powered turbine technology for 2
500
000 newly issued shares of the Company which were distributed in a dividend to its shareholders and Perpetual Wind Power Corporation returned to treasury its 24
500
000 shares it acquired from the Company's shareholders. As a result of this transaction
 the Company had on January 19
 2013
 3
000
000 shares issued and outstanding. On February 14
 2013
 the Company changed its name from Mega World Food Holding Company to Liberated Energy
 Inc. and underwent a 24 for 1 stock split
 whereby the Company's outstanding shares increased from 3
000
000 to 72
000
000.

The principal executive office is located at 109 Burtons Road
 Marlton
 New Jersey 08053.



On January 19
 2013
 the Company disposed of its wholly-owned subsidiary
 Mega World Food Limited (HK).&#160;&#160;Mega World Food Limited (HK) was incorporated on June 24
 2010 and was in the business of selling frozen vegetables in all areas of the world except China.&#160;&#160;From inception
 Mega World Food Limited (HK) only incurred setting up
 formation or organization activities.&#160;&#160;Upon disposal
 the Company ceased these operations and accordingly
 the Company&#8217;s financial statements have been prepared with the net assets
 results of operations
 and cash flows of this business displayed separately as &#8220;discontinued operations.&#8221;

Effective January 19
 2013
 the Company&#8217;s business is the sale of alternative energy products and services.






The Company maintains its books and records on the accrual basis of accounting.&#160;&#160;The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on that basis
 in which revenues and gains are recognized when earned and expenses and losses are recognized when incurred.




















LIBERATED ENERGY
 INC.



FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30
 2013 AND 2012















For the purpose of the statement of cash flows
 cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances
 which are not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties
 and highly liquid investments and debt instruments with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase.




Our short-term financial instruments
 including cash
 other assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses consist primarily of instruments without extended maturities
 the fair value of which
 based on management&#8217;s estimates
 reasonably approximate their book value. The fair value of our notes and advances payable is based on management estimates and reasonably approximates their book value based on their current maturity.




The Company computes per share amounts in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) ASC 260
 Earnings per Share (EPS). ASC 260 requires presentation of basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the periods.


As of September 30
 2013 and 2012
 the Company only issued one type of shares
 i.e.
 common shares only. There is no effect on the diluted loss per share for the stock warrants since the common stock equivalents are anti-dilutive.&#160;&#160;Dilutive average shares outstanding as of September 30
 2013 and 2012 are as follows:

lives of the assets.&#160;&#160;As of September 30
 2013 and 2012
 there was no property and equipment on the Company&#8217;s balance sheets.




Costs incurred in filing
 prosecuting and maintaining patents (principally legal fees) are expensed as incurred and recorded within general and administrative expenses on the statement of operations.&#160;&#160;Such costs aggregated approximately $29
051 and $-0- for the years ended September 30
 2013 and 2012.




The Company accounts for its stock based awards in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 718-10
 Compensation (&#8220;ASC 718-10&#8221;)
 which requires a fair value measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors
 including restricted stock awards. We estimate the fair value of stock using the stock price on date of the approval of the award. The fair value is then expensed over the requisite service periods of the awards
 which is generally the date at which the counterparty&#8217;s performance is complete and the related amount recognized in our statements of operations.

 2013 AND 2012










The Company has generated no revenues to date. It is the Company&#8217;s policy that revenue from product sales or services will be recognized in accordance with ASC 605 &#8220;Revenue Recognition&#8221;. Four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management&#8217;s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers
 estimated returns and allowances
 and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for which the product was not delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.




The Company utilizes ASC 740 &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method
 deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Temporary differences between taxable income reported for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes primarily relate to the recognition of debt costs and stock based compensation expense. The adoption of ASC 740-10 did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.




In accordance with ASC 730
 &#8220;Research and Development&#8221;
 the Company expenses all research and development costs as incurred. The Company had incurred $3
523 research and development costs for the year ended September 30
 2013 and from January 19
 2013 (date of inception of the development stage) through September 30
 2013. The Company expects the research and development costs to increase in the future as it continues to invest in the infrastructure that is critical to achieve its business goals and objectives.

This update is intended to reduce cost and complexity by providing an entity with the option to make a qualitative assessment about the likelihood that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired to determine whether it should perform a quantitative impairment test. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on its financial statements.




The Company has evaluated subsequent events through January 13
 2014
 the date the financial statements were available to be issued.





The Company is currently in the development stage and their activities consist solely of corporate formation
 raising capital
 and attempting to sell products to generate revenues.








The Company&#8217;s lack of operating history and financial resources raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and if the Company is unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing
 then the Company may be required to cease or curtail its operations.

The tax effect of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets as of September 30
 2013 is presented below:








































In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets
 management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.




Pursuant to Patent Acquisition Agreement signed on January 19
 2013 between the Company and Perpetual Wind Power Corporation (the &#8220;Seller&#8221;)
 a privately held company organized in the State of Delaware
 Seller agrees to sell to the Company and the Company agrees to purchase from the Seller the perpetual wind patent for an aggregate purchase price of 2
500
000 newly issued common stock of the Company with par value of $0.001 to be issued to the Seller&#8217;s shareholders.&#160;&#160;Seller also agrees as additional consideration at the closing date to return the Company&#8217;s treasury the 24
500
000 shares of common stock with the par value of $0.001.


The Company used the par value method to record the patent acquisition transaction.&#160;&#160;The management estimated that the patent acquisition transaction is in good faith and with mutually agreed price which represents the fair value of the patent.&#160;&#160;Due to there were no active stock trading activities
 the trading price for the Company may not represent the fair value of the patent.&#160;&#160;Accordingly
 the Company recorded the total patent of $2500
 and returned treasury stocks of $24
500.&#160;&#160;Due to the limited stock market activities and limited access of a pending patent application
 there might be uncertainty about the patent valuation.&#160;&#160;The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.






















Not Applicable. There are not and have not been any disagreements between the Registrant and its accountants on any matter of accounting principles
 practices or financial statement disclosure.





Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate controls over financial reporting. The Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure (i) that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;)
 are recorded
 processed
 summarized
 and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms; and (ii) that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company&#8217;s management
 including its principal executive and principal financial officer
 or persons performing similar functions
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.


Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore
 even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Furthermore
 smaller reporting companies face additional limitations.&#160;&#160;Smaller reporting companies employ fewer individuals and may find it difficult to properly segregate duties.&#160;&#160;Often
 one or two individuals control every aspect of the Company's operation and are in a position to override any system of internal control.&#160; Additionally
 smaller reporting companies tend to utilize general accounting software packages that lack a rigorous set of software controls.


Pursuant to rules adopted by the SEC as directed by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 the Company&#8217;s management
 with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
 evaluated the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules13a-15(e)) as of September 30
 2013.&#160;&#160;In making this assessment
 our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework.


Under the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#8220;COSO&#8221;). Based on this revaluation under the criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework
 our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30
 2013.


Based on that evaluation
 the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
 as of that date
 the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15
 were not effective at a reasonable assurance level.&#160;&#160;Management&#8217;s assessment identified the following material weaknesses:








As of September 30
 2013
 there were insufficient written policies and procedures to insure the correct application of accounting and financial reporting with respect to the current requirements of GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements.












As of September 30
 2013
 there was a lack of segregation of duties
 in that we only had one person performing all accounting-related duties.












As of September 30
 2013
 there were no independent directors and no independent audit committee.




























As of September 30
 2013
 there was a failure in the operating effectiveness over controls related to accounting for convertible debt and embedded derivative liabilities.





Notwithstanding the existence of these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting
 our management believes that the financial statements included in its reports fairly present in all material respects the Company&#8217;s financial condition
 results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.&#160;&#160;We continue to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls and procedures on an on-going basis.&#160;&#160;We plan to further address these issues once we commence operations and are able to hire additional personnel in financial reporting.





During the most recent completed fiscal quarter
 there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.





For purposes of this Item 9A
 the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of the Company (i) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 and hereinafter the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;Commission&#8221;)
 and (ii) include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management
 including its principal executive and principal financial officers
 or persons performing similar functions
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures do not yet comply with the requirements in (i) and (ii) above.


Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report and have concluded that (i) the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that material information relating to the Company is recorded
 processed
 summarized
 and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Commission
 and (ii) the Company&#8217;s controls and procedures have not been designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management
 including its principal executive and principal financial officers
 or persons performing similar functions
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.





There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation that occurred during our last quarter (our fourth quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.






















Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of Company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of Company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations
 our internal control over financial reporting does not provide assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.


The Registrant&#8217;s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30
 2013
 based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
 which assessment identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a control deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that creates a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement in annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Since the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting did identify a material weakness
 management considers its internal control over financial reporting to be ineffective.


Our independent public accountant
 Enterprise CPA has not conducted an audit of our controls and procedures regarding internal control over financial reporting. Consequently
 Enterprise CPA expresses no opinion with regards to the effectiveness or implementation of our controls and procedures with regards to internal control over financial reporting.





The Company's management does not expect that its disclosure controls or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system
 no matter how well designed and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
 and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further
 because of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
 within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons
 by collusion of two or more people
 or management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
 and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time
 controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

 2015 at $1.00 per share
 and with Ms. Elyse Thompson granting her the right to acquire 200

The following tables set forth the ownership
 as of the date of this prospectus
 of our common stock by each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock
 our directors
 and our executive officers and directors as a group.&#160;&#160;To the best of our knowledge
 the persons named have sole voting and investment power with respect to such shares
 except as otherwise noted.&#160;&#160;There are not any pending or anticipated arrangements that may cause a change in control.


The information presented below regarding beneficial ownership of our voting securities has been presented in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not necessarily indicative of ownership for any other purpose. Under these rules
 a person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of the security or the power to dispose or direct the disposition of the security. A person is deemed to own beneficially any security as to which such person has the right to acquire sole or shared voting or investment power within 60 days through the conversion or exercise of any convertible security
 warrant
 option or other right. More than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities. The percentage of beneficial ownership by any person as of a particular date is calculated by dividing the number of shares beneficially owned by such person
 which includes the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within 60 days
 by the sum of the number of shares outstanding as of such date plus the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within 60 days. Consequently
 the denominator used for calculating such percentage may be different for each beneficial owner. Except as otherwise indicated below and under applicable community property laws
 we believe that the beneficial owners of our common stock listed below have sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares shown.

These tables are based upon 72

 we believe unless otherwise noted that each of the shareholders named in this table has sole or shared voting and investment power with respect to the shares indicated as beneficially owned. For purposes of this table
 a person or group of persons is deemed to have beneficial ownership of any shares which such person has the right to acquire within 60 days as of January 13
 2014. For purposes of computing the percentage of outstanding shares held by each person or group of persons named above on January 13
 2014 any security which such person or group of persons has the right to acquire within 60 days after such date is deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership for such person or persons
 but is not deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

Our board of directors has determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as &#8220;independent&#8221; as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

 and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(15) of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules.














Aggregate fees billed by the Company's principal accountants
 Enterprise CPA
 for audit services related to the most recent two fiscal years
 and for other professional services billed in the most recent two fiscal years
 were as follows:

(1) Comprised of the audit of the Company's annual financial statements and reviews of the Company's quarterly financial statements
 as well as consents related to and reviews of other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.


(2) Comprised of preparation of all federal and state corporate income tax returns for the Company and its subsidiaries. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 all audit and non-audit services performed by the Company's independent accountants must now be approved in advance by the Audit Committee to assure that such services do not impair the accountants' independence from the Company. The Company does not have an Audit Committee
 therefore
 the Board of Directors reviews and approves audit and permissible non-audit services performed by Enterprise CPA
 as well as the fees charged by Enterprise CPA for such services.





As defined by the SEC
 (i) &#8220;audit fees&#8221; are fees for professional services rendered by our principal accountant for the audit of our annual financial statements and review of financial statements included in our Form 10-K
 or for services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years; (ii) &#8220;audit-related fees&#8221; are fees for assurance and related services by our principal accountant that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under &#8220;audit fees;&#8221; (iii) &#8220;tax fees&#8221; are fees for professional services rendered by our principal accountant for tax compliance
 tax advice
 and tax planning; and (iv) &#8220;all other fees&#8221; are fees for products and services provided by our principal accountant
 other than the services reported under &#8220;audit fees
&#8221; &#8220;audit-related fees
&#8221; and &#8220;tax fees.&#8221;



















Under applicable SEC rules
 the Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent auditors in order to ensure that they do not impair the auditors&#8217; independence. The SEC&#8217;s rules specify the types of non-audit services that an independent auditor may not provide to its audit client and establish the Audit Committee&#8217;s responsibility for administration of the engagement of the independent auditors. Until such time as we have an Audit Committee in place
 the Board of Directors will pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent auditors.


Consistent with the SEC&#8217;s rules
 the Audit Committee Charter requires that the Audit Committee review and pre-approve all audit services and permitted non-audit services provided by the independent auditors to us or any of our subsidiaries. The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to a member of the Audit Committee and if it does
 the decisions of that member must be presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.

Note
2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis
of Accounting


records on the accrual basis of accounting. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on that basis
 in which revenues
and gains are recognized when earned and expenses and losses are recognized when incurred.

Use
of Estimates


in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents


of cash flows
 cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances
 which are not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties
and highly liquid investments and debt instruments with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments


including cash
 other assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses consist primarily of instruments without extended maturities
the fair value of which
 based on management&#146;s estimates
 reasonably approximate their book value. The fair value of our
notes and advances payable is based on management estimates and reasonably approximates their book value based on their current
maturity.

Net
Loss per Common Share


in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) ASC 260
 Earnings per Share (EPS). ASC 260 requires presentation
of basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
and common stock equivalents outstanding during the periods.


 2013 and 2012
the Company only issued one type of shares
 i.e.
 common shares only. There is no effect on the diluted loss per share for the
stock warrants since the common stock equivalents are anti-dilutive. Dilutive average shares outstanding as of September 30
 2013
and 2012 are as follows:

Property
and Equipment


carried at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment for financial reporting purposes is provided using the straight-line method
over their respective estimated useful lives of the assets. As of September 30
 2013 and 2012
 there was no property and equipment
on the Company&#146;s balance sheets.

Patent
Costs


prosecuting and maintaining patents (principally legal fees) are expensed as incurred and recorded within general and administrative
expenses on the statement of operations. Such costs aggregated approximately $29
051 and $-0- for the years ended September 30
2013 and 2012.

Stock-Based
Compensation


stock based awards in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 718-10
 Compensation (&#147;ASC 718-10&#148;)
which requires a fair value measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our
employees and directors
 including restricted stock awards. We estimate the fair value of stock using the stock price on date of
the approval of the award. The fair value is then expensed over the requisite service periods of the awards
 which is generally
the date at which the counterparty&#146;s performance is complete and the related amount recognized in our statements of operations.

Revenue
and Cost Recognition


to date. It is the Company&#146;s policy that revenue from product sales or services will be recognized in accordance with ASC
605 &#147;Revenue Recognition&#148;. Four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence
of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is
reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management&#146;s judgments regarding the fixed nature
of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to
customers
 estimated returns and allowances
 and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded.
The Company will defer any revenue for which the product was not delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company
and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.

Income
Taxes


Taxes&#148; which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of
events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method
 deferred income taxes are recognized
for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting
amounts at each year-end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are
expected to affect taxable income. Temporary differences between taxable income reported for financial reporting purposes and income
tax purposes primarily relate to the recognition of debt costs and stock based compensation expense. The adoption of ASC 740-10
did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.

Research
and Development


 &#147;Research
and Development&#148;
 the Company expenses all research and development costs as incurred. The Company had incurred $3
523 research
and development costs for the year ended September 30
 2013 and from January 19
 2013 (date of inception of the development stage)
through September 30
 2013. The Company expects the research and development costs to increase in the future as it continues to
invest in the infrastructure that is critical to achieve its business goals and objectives.




financial statements have been reclassified for comparative purposes to conform with the presentation in the current-year financial
statements.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements


2012-02: Intangibles: Goodwill and Other: Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment (Topic 350) which is effective
for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15
 2012. This update is intended
to reduce cost and complexity by providing an entity with the option to make a qualitative assessment about the likelihood that
an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired to determine whether it should perform a quantitative impairment test. The Company
does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on its financial statements.

Subsequent
Events


events through October XX
 2013
 the date the financial statements were available to be issued.
