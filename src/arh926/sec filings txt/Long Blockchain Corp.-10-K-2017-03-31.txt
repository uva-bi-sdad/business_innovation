PART

ITEM
    1.
    




We
are a holding company operating through our wholly-owned subsidiary
 LIBB. We are engaged in the production and distribution of
premium Non-Alcoholic Ready-to-Drink (&ldquo;NARTD&rdquo;) beverages. We are currently organized around our flagship iced
tea product
. The Long Island Iced Tea name for a cocktail originated
in Long Island in the 1970&rsquo;s
 and its national recognition is such that it is ranked as the fourth most popular cocktail
in restaurants and bars in the U.S. (Source: Nielsen CGA
 On-Premise Consumer Survey
 2016). Our premium NARTD tea is made from
 is sold in 27 states across the U.S.
primarily on the East Coast
 through a network of national and regional retail chains and distributors.

Since
February 2016
 we have been engaged in the aloe juice business
 under the brand ALO Juice. ALO Juice is a NARTD functional
beverage made from juice derived from the aloe plant known as aloe vera. ALO Juice sources its aloe plants from harvests in Thailand.
The plants are exported from there to South Korea where they are processed in a unique whole leaf manner to ensure the nutritional
and health benefits are maintained from the plant all the way through to the bottling process.

On
March 14
 2017
 we announced the expansion of our brand with the launch of The Original Long Island Brand&trade; Lemonade. This
lemonade is a NARTD functional beverage made from a proprietary recipe with quality components.

Our
mission is to provide consumers with &ldquo;better-for-you&rdquo; premium beverages offered at an affordable price.

We
aspire to be a market leader in the development of beverages that are convenient and appealing to consumers. There are two major
target markets for our beverages: consumers on the go and health conscious consumers. Consumers on the go are families
employees
 students and other consumers who lead a busy lifestyle. With increasingly hectic and demanding schedules
 there is
a need for products that are accessible and readily available. Health conscious consumers are individuals who are becoming more
interested and better educated on what is included in their diets
 causing them to shift away from options perceived as less healthy
such as carbonated soft drinks (&ldquo;CSDs&rdquo;) towards alternative beverages such as iced tea.

We
continually seek to expand our product line. We are exploring entry into the $222 billion U.S. alcohol industry
 with the hope
to establish ourselves as a multi-product alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage company.


    
    


We
also continually seek to better develop emerging markets
 as well as expand our overall geographic footprint. We entered
into new business arrangements involving international specialists contracted to (i) identify new market opportunities and (ii)
assist in the overall management of our international expansion efforts. During 2016
 the Company announced new distributorships
in Columbia
 Honduras
 Dominican Republic
 St Martin and Bermuda. We also worked alongside new distributor partnerships in Puerto
Rico
 Canada and South Korea to further expand distribution points throughout their respective markets. New developments included
(i) new retail partnerships opened with supermarket chains such as Pueblos and Supermax in Puerto Rico
 (ii) our first shipment
to Canada in November 2016
 and (iii) multiple reorders received from the South Korean distributor.

Corporate
History

We
were incorporated on December 23
 2014 in the State of Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of Cullen.

On
May 27
 2015
 we closed the business combination (the &ldquo;Business Combination&rdquo;) contemplated by the Agreement and Plan
of Reorganization (the &ldquo;Merger Agreement&rdquo;)
 dated as of December 31
 2014 and amended as of April 23
 2015
 by and
among Cullen
 us
 Cullen Merger Sub
 Inc.
 LIBB Acquisition Sub
 LLC
 LIBB
 Philip Thomas and Thomas Panza
 who formerly owned
a majority of the outstanding membership units of LIBB
 and the other former members of LIBB executing a joinder thereto. Pursuant
to the Merger Agreement
 (i) Cullen Merger Sub
 Inc. merged with and into Cullen
 with Cullen surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary
of ours and the stockholders of Cullen receiving one share of our common stock for every 15 shares of Cullen common stock held
by them and (ii) LIBB Acquisition Sub
 LLC merged with and into LIBB
 with LIBB surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of ours
and the members of LIBB receiving an aggregate of 2
633
334 shares of our common stock.

Upon
the closing of the Business Combination
 we became the new public company
 Cullen and LIBB became wholly-owned subsidiaries of
ours and the stockholders of Cullen and the members of LIBB became our stockholders. In addition
 the historical financial statements
of LIBB became our financial statements. As a result of the Business Combination
 the business of LIBB became our business. Cullen
is currently inactive and no significant operations are being undertaken by it. LIBB was formed as a limited liability company
under the laws of New York on February 18
 2011.

Recent
Developments

ALO
Juice

During
2016
 we began selling ALO Juice. The aloe juice product is purchased in its finished form from a third party supplier. On December
8
 2016
 in order to bolster our aloe juice business and further meet growing consumer demand for &ldquo;better-for-you&rdquo;
beverages
 the Company entered into an agreement to purchase the intellectual property related to this product
 including trade
names
 formulas and recipes
 from the owners of the ALO Juice&reg; brand. Consideration upon the closing of the transaction will
consist of 5
000 shares of our common stock. We expect to close this transaction by early Spring 2017.

Separately
we entered into an employment agreement with Julio X Ponce
 majority interest member of the ALO Juice&reg; brand owner. Mr. Ponce
was hired at an annual salary of $90
000 to advance the sales of ALO Juice to the Southeast and Latin American regions effective
January 1
 2017.



On
March 14
 2017
 we announced that we are expanding our brand to include lemonade. The Original Long Island Brand&trade; Lemonade
range consists of 9 real-fruit flavors
 and is available in both single 18oz bottles and 12-packs. This premium lemonade is intended
to be differentiated from other lemonade beverages in the US market. It is made with 100% raw cane sugar and non-GMO ingredients
that incorporate the &ldquo;better-for-you&rdquo; attributes that are prominent within our iced tea brand
 and will complement
Long Island Iced Tea&reg;. We expect that this product will be available in select markets in early Spring 2017. It&rsquo;s
our objective to grow market share and offer this product alongside our iced tea products.

As

secured convertible promissory note (the &ldquo;Brentwood Note&rdquo;)
 which is convertible into shares of our common stock at

 in connection with the establishment of the Credit Facility
 we issued to

of the Credit Agreement
 except that
 in connection with the Recapitalization
 the maximum amount (the &ldquo;Facility Amount&rdquo;)
of loans that may be made under the Credit Facility was reduced to $3
500
000. Brentwood is owned by Eric Watson
 who as of March

 beneficially owned approximately 17.3% of our outstanding Common Stock

Globally
NARTD tea products are ranked as the 4th largest beverage category
 behind carbonated soft drinks
 water and dairy. The non-alcohol
iced tea global category size is estimated at $55 billion and growing at a 6.6% compound annual growth rate (&ldquo;CAGR&rdquo;).

 &ldquo;Versatility of RTD Tea Generates Bright Spot in Global Soft Drinks&rdquo;
 May

The
U.S. non-alcoholic liquid refreshment beverage market consists of a number of different products
 and CSDs are the top selling
beverage category. However
 consumers are increasingly coming to view CSDs (typically caffeinated as well as high in sugar and
preservatives) with disfavor. In volume
 the CSD category declined 0.6% in 2016
 1.5% in 2015
 1.6% in 2014
 2.3% in 2013 and
1.5% in 2012. (Sources: Euromonitor International
 &ldquo;Carbonates in the US&rdquo;
 February 2017).

CSDs
have historically dominated the non-alcoholic liquid refreshment beverage market and been primarily controlled by two industry
giants
 Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. However
 a number of beverages began to emerge in the 1990s as alternatives to CSDs as part of
a societal shift towards beverages that are perceived to be healthier. The alternative beverage category of the market has resulted
in the birth of multiple new product segments that include sports drinks
 energy drinks and NARTD teas.

According
to a 2017 Euromonitor International industry report
 the U.S. NARTD tea segment was expected to have $7.1 billion of revenue in
2016
 a 7.9% increase from the prior year and an 8.3% annualized growth rate over the last 5 years (2011 &ndash; 2016) (Source:
Euromonitor International 
 &ldquo;RTD Tea in the US&rdquo;
 February 2017). The industry report also forecasted an annual revenue
growth rate of 5.3% over the coming five years
 with revenues reaching $9.2 billion in 2021.


    
    


In
2014
 consumers showed special interest in healthier versions of NARTD teas
 preferring unsweetened teas.

Our
Products and Services

Long
Island Iced Tea&reg; was first launched in the New York metro market by LIBB in July 2011
 positioning itself as a premium iced
tea beverage offered at an affordable price. We help differentiate ourselves from competitors with a proprietary recipe and quality
components. Long Island Iced Tea&reg; is a 100% brewed tea
 using black tea leaves and purified water via reverse osmosis. It
is gluten-free
 free of genetically modified organisms
 or &ldquo;GMOs
&rdquo; and certified Kosher with no artificial colors
or preservatives.

Long
Island Iced Tea&reg; is primarily produced and bottled in the U.S. Northeast. This production in the Northeast
 combined with
its &ldquo;Made in America&rdquo; tag-line and brand name
 all improve its credentials as a part of the local community from which
we take our name.

We
have developed ten flavors of Long Island Iced Tea&reg; in an effort to ensure that our products meet the desired taste preferences
of consumers. Regular flavors
 which use natural cane sugar as a sweetener
 include lemon
 peach
 raspberry
 green tea &amp; honey
half tea &amp; half lemonade
 guava
 mango
 and sweet tea. Diet flavors
 which use sucralose (generic Splenda) instead of natural
cane sugar as a sweetener
 include diet lemon and diet peach. These flavors are currently available in twelve packs of 20oz polyethylene
terephthalate bottles.


    
    



We
have unveiled a new 18oz bottle and label design for our flagship Long Island Iced Tea&reg; Brand
 which will replace our 20oz
size. The sleeker and slimmer 18oz design accentuates an authentic and fresh spirit of Long Island Iced Tea&reg; products
 which
we believe will have a positive impact on our product gross margins. The bold and cleanly designed label aligns with our core
brand image
 clearly emphasizing the brand&rsquo;s premium ingredients and better-for-you positioning. Both the label and customized
bottle cap include informative health cues that include &ldquo;non-GMO
&rdquo; &ldquo;100% raw cane sugar
&rdquo; &ldquo;no additives
&rdquo;
and &ldquo;low calories&rdquo; for diet flavors. The new bottles are expected to reach retail stores in early 2017. Any reference
to 20oz size is intended to include both 18oz and 20oz packaging within this annual report.

We
have also recently developed three twenty-four pack of sixty calorie flavors that are served in 12oz bottles. The sixty calorie
flavors have reduced sugar content
 are caffeine free and include mango
 peach
 and raspberry. This package was designed to meet
certain nutritional guidelines for sales in schools. During May 2015
 we launched four flavors
 lemon
 peach
 mango
 and green
tea and honey
 in gallon containers. During February 2016
 we also launched sweet tea
 which is also served in a gallon container.
In addition
 during April 2016
 we launched a private label line
 consisting of four flavors
 for one of our existing customers.

We
have also recently developed The Original Long Island Brand&trade; Lemonade
 which comes in nine real-fruit flavors
and is available in both single 18oz bottles and 12-packs that will be sold in the same locations that our iced tea is offered
in early 2017.

ALO
Juice has been distributed in New York City since 2008
 and in Florida since 2012. We commenced distribution
of ALO Juice in February 2016. It is packed in 0.5 liter and 1.5 liter bottles
 with a wide variety of flavors including Original
Mango
 Pomegranate
 Pineapple and Raspberry. Aloe vera juice contains nutrients which include vitamins A
 C
 E
 and B12
 as well
as minerals like potassium
 zinc
 and magnesium. It also provides antioxidants
 helps to balance metabolism
 and supports normal
circulation and blood pressure.

Our
Competitive Strengths

We
believe that a differentiated brand will be a key competitive strength in the NARTD tea segment. Key points of differentiation
for Long Island Iced Tea&reg; and Long Island Brand&trade; Lemonade include:



    
    
A
    better and bolder tasting bottled iced tea as a result of premium ingredients that include natural cane sugar (sucralose for
    diet flavors)
 hot-filled using black and green tea leaves
 that is offered at an affordable price;

    
    
    

    
    
Immediate
    global recognition of the &ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea&rdquo; phrase associated with the cocktail;

    
    
    

    
    
Made
    in America;

    
    
    

    
    
Strong
    Northeast roots where it is locally produced;

    
    
    

    
    
The
    use of non-GMO ingredients; and

    
    
    

    
    
Our
    product being corn free
 hormone/antibiotic free
 gluten free
 natural and having no artificial color/flavor.


The
NARTD tea market is a crowded space and
 as a result
 we believe in pricing our products competitively. We highlight to consumers
our use of premium ingredients and our affordable price. The suggested retail price for a 20oz. bottle of Long Island Iced Tea&reg;
is $1.00 to $1.50
 and the suggested retail price for a 12oz. bottle is $1.00 to $1.25. The suggested retail price for our gallon
containers is $2.99 to $3.49. The suggested retail price of The Original Long Island Brand&trade; Lemonade is $1.25 to $1.79 per
18oz bottle. ALO Juice&reg; has a suggested retail price of $1.49 to $1.79 for the 500 ml bottle and $2.39 to $2.79 for the 1.5
liter bottle. Management has set pricing levels to reflect current pricing dynamics in the industry. There has been downward pressure
on prices
 which management believes is caused by the entrance of major multinational beverage corporations into the alternative
beverage category. This is starting to lead towards industry consolidation
 in what is currently considered a somewhat fragmented
marketplace.


    
    



Our
Business Strategies 

In
addition to a potential expansion into alcoholic beverages
 we are seeking to organically grow our NARTD tea and related product
sales
 capitalizing on an iconic name with unique brand awareness to create familiar and easily recognizable beverages.

We
intend to increase our market share in our existing geographic markets and expand into additional geographic markets in the U.S.
We also are exploring international markets on a highly selective and limited basis
 which may include royalty and licensing agreements.
 
&rdquo; we generally focus our sales efforts on approaching beverage distributors
and taking advantage of their unique positioning in the retail industry. However
 a portion of our sales efforts are also dedicated
to direct sales to retailers
 because some wholesale chains such as Sam&rsquo;s Club and Costco request direct shipments from
the product supplier. In addition
 we are exploring several new sales channels. We currently are conducting a small scale business
trial in which we sell our beverage product alongside other snacks in vending machines. We also commenced selling our twelve ounce
lower calorie products in schools
 in some cases through sales to purchasing cooperatives that represent multiple school districts
but also via the vending machine business trial.

During
the quarter ended December 31
 2015
 we determined the brand had sufficient scale
 distribution and volume per point of distribution
to test market expansion into (i) additional U.S. states
 (ii) significant new regional chains
 and (iii) national chains. To
facilitate this expansion
 we recruited Joseph Caramele
 our Vice President of National Sales &amp; Marketing. Mr. Caramele had
spent the previous nine years working in national and chain account sales for Arizona Beverages USA
 at which time he oversaw
the regional and national chain account expansion. In 2016
 Mr. Caramele&rsquo;s responsibilities included building sales and
distribution footprint throughout the Southeast
 Midwest and eventually across the entire country. Additionally
 Mr. Caramele
is responsible for extending our sales outreach by developing broker relationships with companies such as SellEthics Marketing
Inc. and JOH. These brokers were contracted to assist in the execution of company marketing plans (primarily at store level) and
utilize networks to accelerate national expansion efforts.

As
part of our marketing efforts
 we commonly use store demos
 as we have found a positive correlation between demos and sales especially
at the introduction phase in new stores. We expect to continue using store demos in order to increase brand awareness and sales
as we continue to expand into new markets. We also use co-op advertising (advertisements by retailers that include the specific
mention of manufacturers
 who
 in turn
 repay the retailers for all or part of the cost of the advertisement) and special promotions
together with its retail partners
 so as to complement other marketing efforts towards brand awareness.

We
also seek to expand our product line. From time to time
 we explore and test market potential of new NARTD products that may
in the future
 contribute to our operating performance. We expect that the introduction of The Original Long Island Brand&trade;
Lemonade
 with nine different flavors
 will be able to attract a new market segment of beverage drinkers. We expect that
our ALO Juice brand product will sit alongside our flagship Long Island Brand tea. We are committed to building the ALO Juice
brand and expanding its distribution. To accomplish our long-term growth strategy for this brand
 we entered into an agreement
to acquire the intellectual property related to this product. We expect to close this agreement by April 2017. We also may consider
exploring our strategic acquisitions from time to time
 although this is not a primary business focus.

Manufacturing
and Raw Materials

Long
Island Iced Tea&reg; and Long Island Brand&trade; Lemonade are currently produced by Brooklyn Bottling Group
 Wayne County Foods
Inc.
 Polar Corp.
 and LiDestri Spirits
 all of which are established co-packing companies with reputable quality control. We
intend to identify additional co-packers in the U.S. and other countries to support the continued growth of the brand. ALO Juice
is purchased as a finished product from a third party supplier in South Korea.

The
principal raw materials we use in our iced tea and lemonade business are bottles
 caps
 labels
 packaging materials
 tea essence
and tea base
 lemonade base
 sugar
 natural flavors and other sweeteners
 juice
 electricity
 fuel and water. Our principal suppliers
for the year ended December 31
 2016
 were Zuckerman-Honickman
 Inc. (bottles) and Allen Flavors
 Inc. (natural flavors) who
together with Lidestri Spirits (copacker)
 accounted for 46% of our purchases of inventory and copacking fees. In addition
 23%
of our purchases were related to the purchase of finished bottled ALO Juice
 which is purchased from suppliers located in South
Korea. Our principal iced tea suppliers for the year ended December 31
 2015 were Zuckerman-Honickman
 Inc. (bottles)
 Dominos
Food
 Inc. (sugar) and Allen Flavors
 Inc. (natural flavors) who
 together with Union Beverage Packers LLC (copacker)
 accounted
for 80% of our purchases of raw materials inventory and copacking fees.


    
    



Our
relationships with our suppliers and co-packers are typically governed by short-term purchase orders or similar arrangements.
We do not have any material contracts or other material arrangements with these parties and presently do not mitigate our exposure
to volatility in the prices of raw materials or co-packing services through the use of forward contracts
 pricing agreements or
other hedging arrangements. Accordingly
 we are subject to fluctuations in the costs of our raw materials and co-packing services.

Furthermore
some of our raw materials
 such as bottles
 caps
 labels
 tea essence and tea base
 sugar
 natural flavors and other sweeteners
and juice
 are available from only a few suppliers. As a result
 we may be subject to substantial increases in prices or shortages
of raw materials
 if the suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements.

Our
Customers

We
sell our products to a mix of independent mid-to-large size beverage distributors who in turn sell to retail outlets
 such as
big chain supermarkets
 mass merchants
 convenience stores
 restaurants and hotels principally in the New York
 New Jersey
 Connecticut
and Pennsylvania markets. We have also begun expansion into other geographic markets
 such as Florida
 Virginia
 Massachusetts
New Hampshire
 Nevada
 Rhode Island
 North Carolina
 South Carolina and parts of the Midwest. Our products are currently available
in twenty three states that have a cumulative population of 100 million. While we primarily sell our products indirectly through
distributors
 at times we sell directly to the retail outlets and we may sell to certain retail outlets both directly and indirectly
through distributors. We also sell our products directly to the distribution facilities of some of our retailers and through &ldquo;road
shows
&rdquo; which are temporary installations at retail outlets staffed by our employees or contractors.

For
the year ended December 31
 2016
 our top customers
 Seba Distribution LLC and Garden Foods
 accounted for 20% and 11%
of the Company&rsquo;s net sales
 respectively. For the year ended December 31
 2015
 one customer
 Wakefern Food Corp.
 accounted
for 10% of net sales.

Our
sales are typically governed by short-term purchase orders. We do not have any material contracts or other material arrangements
with our customers or distributors and do not obtain commitments from them to purchase or sell a minimum amount of our products
or to purchase or sell such products at a minimum price. Because our sales may be concentrated with a few customers
 our results
of operations may be materially adversely affected if one of these customers significantly reduces the volume of its purchases
or demands a reduction in price
 which may occur at any time due to the absence of such purchase commitments.



Our
management team consists of persons with substantial experience in the beverage industry. Philip Thomas
 our Chief Executive Officer
and LIBB&rsquo;s co-founder
 has over 16 years of beverage experience. Julian Davidson
 our Executive Chairman
 has over 25 years
of experience in the beverage industry
 including most recently serving as Chief Executive Officer of Independent Liquor NZ&rsquo;s
businesses in New Zealand
 the U.S. and Canada. Independent Liquor NZ is a manufacturer and distributor of pre-mixed ARTD beverages
as well as having beer
 spirit and cider portfolios. Richard Allen
 our Chief Financial Officer
 has over 30 years of experience
in the beverage and food industries
 including roles at Beverage Innovations
 Cadbury Schweppes and Snapple. Joseph Caramele
our Vice President of National Sales &amp; Marketing
 has substantial experience in the beverage industry
 having spent the past
nine years at Arizona Beverages USA
 most recently as Executive National Sales Director for the past five years. As Executive
National Sales Director
 he managed a team of 85 individuals and portfolio of over 100 accounts with annual retail sales estimated
to be over $850 million. We intend to expand our current management and recruit other skilled officers and employees with experience
relevant to our business focus as needed.


    
    


Operations
and Assets

We
currently use co-packing companies
 Brooklyn Bottling Group
 Wayne County Foods
 Inc.
 Polar Corp.
 and LiDestri Spirits to manufacture
Long Island Iced Tea&reg; and Long Island Brand&trade; Lemonade. The product is shipped directly to distributors or retailers
as well as to our warehouse in Hicksville
 NY or our other storage facilities prior to delivery to sales partners. Principal assets
include vehicles to support the marketing of the brand and to transport the product
 as well as storage equipment for the warehouse.
Our principal assets also include display equipment such as vending machines
 refrigerators and racks. This equipment is strategically
placed at retail locations in order to market our product line.

We
purchase our aloe juice product through a third party supplier in its finished form. There are no current operations or assets;
however
 after the close of the asset purchase agreement we will acquire only the intellectual property to produce ALO Juice including
tradenames
 formulas
 and recipes.




The
beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations. As the iced tea beverage segment
 including Long Island Iced Tea&reg;
experiences its highest levels of demand during the warm spring and summer months
 cold or rainy weather during this time may
have a short-term impact on customer demand and therefore result in lower sales.



The
beverage industry is extremely competitive. Long Island Iced Tea is competing with a wide range of beverages that are produced
by a large number of manufacturers. Most of these brands have enjoyed broad public recognition for many years
 accomplished through
continuous and well-funded marketing campaigns. We will compete with all types of beverages
 both CSDs and non-CSDs
 facing higher
competition from direct product competitors in the NARTD tea market. Key direct competitors are Arizona Beverage Company
 Unilever
Dr. Pepper Snapple Group
 Inc. and Nestle SA. In order to be able to compete successfully in the industry
 we have to distinguish
our products in price and in taste and flavor
 and offer attractive promotions to customers and appealing packaging. Moreover
we will have to well position the brand with targeted sales and marketing campaigns.

The
aloe juice business is a fast growing industry as consumer demand grows for a &ldquo;better-for-you&rdquo; beverage that has healthy
benefits and is great tasting. The aloe juice segment is projected to experience high growth worldwide for the foreseeable future
and there will be opportunities for new entrances in the market. The presence of small and large vendors makes the global aloe
vera-based drinks market extremely fragmented. Intense competition prevails in the market in terms of price
 quality
 innovation
reputation
 and distribution. Key direct competitors that provide a high quality aloe juice product are OKF Aloe King
 Alo Farms
Forever Living Products
 and Houssy Global.

Intellectual
Property

&ldquo;Long
Island Iced Tea&rdquo; is a trademark of ours. We currently have federal registration of the trademark &ldquo;Long Island Iced
Tea&rdquo; and are pursuing such registration of the trademark &ldquo;The Original Long Island Brand.&rdquo; We intend to seek
registration of such trademarks in other countries as well. In addition
 we are seeking or plan to seek a number of other trademarks
for tag lines and product designs.

We
filed applications with the USPTO for the registration of the trademark &ldquo;Long Island Brand Iced Tea&rdquo; on August 28
2012 and subsequently for the registration of the trademark &ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea&rdquo; on July 23
 2013. Both applications
encountered resistance to registration as a result of the existence of the mark &ldquo;Long Island&rdquo; for &ldquo;iced tea.&rdquo;
We determined that the mark &ldquo;Long Island&rdquo; for &ldquo;iced tea&rdquo; was abandoned. As a result we filed a petition
to cancel the registration on this ground. In January 2015
 the petition was granted and the mark was cancelled. Accordingly
we petitioned for the mark &ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea&rdquo; to be placed on the supplemental register. On April 19
 2016
 the
USPTO registered the mark &ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea&rdquo; (Registration No. 4
943
056) on the supplemental register. Registration
on the supplemental register allows the use of the &ldquo;&reg;&rdquo; symbol
 blocks later filed applications for confusingly
similar marks
 and allows us to sue infringers in federal court which has well-settled case law and standards. Notwithstanding
the foregoing
 the supplemental register does not provide all the protection of a registration on the principal register. At this
time
 the mark is not &ldquo;incontestable&rdquo; and we may be open to claims of others contesting the trademark.


    
    


In
addition
 we have filed trademark applications for &ldquo;The Original Long Island Brand&rdquo; as a standard character mark and
as a stylized mark
 which are pending before the USPTO. In each case
 the application is for use of the trademark with iced tea
tea based products
 juices
 water
 beverages and other similar products. &ldquo;The Original Long Island Brand&rdquo; standard
character trademark has been in use in commerce by us since at least as early as February 29
 2012. We also plan to file for stylized
marks protecting certain other tag lines and product designs. With respect to the pending trademark applications for &ldquo;The
Original Long Island Brand&rdquo; (standard character mark and stylized mark)
 the USPTO has made an initial determination that
both marks are geographically descriptive. This determination is refutable and the USPTO has afforded the company the opportunity
to produce evidence to establish that the marks have become distinctive of the goods in commerce. Similar issues
 or other issues
also may arise in connection with the other marks for which we are seeking registration or intend to seek registration. Registration
of these marks will allow us to utilize the &ldquo;&reg;&rdquo; symbol to notify others that our marks are federally registered
and allow us to enforce these marks in federal court
 among other benefits. There can be no assurance
 however
 that the USPTO
will approve these applications.

Our
intellectual property is protected through the acquisition of registered and unregistered trademarks as described above
 the acquisition
of patents
 the maintenance of trade secrets
 the development of trade dress
 and
 where appropriate
 litigation against those
who are
 in our opinion
 infringing our intellectual property rights. We intend to aggressively assert our rights under trade
secret
 unfair competition
 trademark
 copyright and other similar laws to protect our intellectual property
 including product
design
 product research and concepts and trademarks
 against any infringer. Although any assertion of our rights could result
in a substantial cost to us
 and diversion of our efforts
 management believes that the protection of our intellectual property
will be a key component of our operating strategy. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 there can be no assurance that the trademarks
described above or our other intellectual property rights will adequately protect information that we deem to be proprietary.

In
an effort to further develop our branding strategy
 we acquired the uniform resource locator (URL) 

Environmental
and Other Regulations

The
conduct of our businesses
 and the production
 distribution
 sale
 advertising
 labeling
 safety
 transportation and use of our
products
 are and will be subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal
 state and local governmental agencies
in the U.S.
 as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets where we may
operate and sell products.

In
the U.S.
 we are or may be required to comply with federal laws
 such as the Food
 Drug and Cosmetic Act
 the Occupational Safety
and Health Act
 the Clean Air Act
 the Clean Water Act
 the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
 laws governing equal employment
opportunity
 customs and foreign trade laws and regulations
 laws regulating the sales of products in schools
 and various other
federal statutes and regulations. We will rely on legal and operational compliance programs
 as well as local counsel
 to guide
our businesses in complying with applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we do business. Our third-party
co-manufacturer is also required to comply with Food and Drug Administration requirements for manufacturing of our product.

We
also may in the future be affected by other existing
 proposed and potential future regulations or regulatory actions
 including
those described below
 any of which could adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. Changes
in government regulation
 or failure to comply with existing regulations
 could adversely affect our business. Public health officials
and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health consequences associated with obesity
 especially as the disease
affects children
 and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages. There also has been an
increased focus on caffeine content in beverages.

Legislation
has been enacted in certain U.S. states in which our products may be sold that requires collection and recycling of containers
or that prohibits the sale of our beverages in certain non-refillable containers unless a deposit or other fee is charged. It
is possible that similar or more restrictive legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.


    
    


We
do not anticipate at this time that the cost of compliance with U.S. and foreign laws will have a material financial impact on
our operations
 business or financial condition
 but there are no guarantees that new regulatory and tariff legislation may not
have a material negative effect on our business in the future.

Research
and Development

We
have incurred approximately $47
067 and $13
333 to research opportunities related to new product initiatives. These costs were
reflected in research and development expense for the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015
 respectively.



At
December 31
 2016
 we had 19 full time employees and 1 part time employee. We also engaged the services of independent contractors
to assist our management team in developing our product offerings.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS

An
investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below
 together
with all of the other information included in this Form 10-K
 before deciding to invest in our securities. If any of the following
risks actually occurs
 our business
 financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In that case
 the trading price
of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.

Risks
Related to Our Business

We
operate in highly competitive markets
 which could negatively affect our sales.

Our
industry is highly competitive. We compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources
 including Dr.
Pepper Snapple Group
 Inc. and Arizona Beverage Company. These competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond
to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products
 reducing prices or increasing promotional
activities. We also compete against a variety of smaller
 regional and private label manufacturers. Smaller companies may be more
innovative
 better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets. Our inability
to compete effectively could result in a decline in our sales. We are subject to competition from companies
 including from some
of our customers
 that either currently manufacture or are developing products directly in competition with our products. These
generic or store-branded products may be a less expensive option for consumers than our products making it more difficult to sell
our product. As a result
 we may have to reduce our prices or increase our spending on marketing
 advertising and product innovation.
Any of these could negatively affect our business and financial performance.


    
    


We
may not effectively respond to changing consumer preferences
 trends
 health concerns and other factors. If we do not effectively
anticipate these trends
 then quickly develop new products
 our sales could suffer.

Consumers&rsquo;
preferences can change due to a variety of factors
 including aging of the population
 social trends
 negative publicity
 economic
downturn or other factors. If we do not effectively anticipate these trends and changing consumer preferences
 then quickly develop
new products in response
 our sales could suffer. Developing and launching new products can be risky and expensive. We may not
be successful in responding to changing markets and consumer preferences
 and some of our competitors may be better able to respond
to these changes
 either of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.

Costs
for our raw materials may increase substantially
 which could negatively affect our financial performance.

The
principal raw materials we use in our business are bottles
 caps
 labels
 packaging materials
 tea essence and tea base
 sugar
natural flavors and other sweeteners
 juice
 electricity
 fuel and water. The cost of the raw materials can fluctuate substantially.
We may not be able to pass along any increases in such costs to our customers or consumers
 which could negatively affect our
business and financial performance. We presently do not mitigate our exposure to volatility in the prices of raw materials through
the use of forward contracts
 pricing agreements or other hedging arrangements.

Certain
raw materials we use are available only from a limited number of suppliers. In the event our suppliers are unable or unwilling
to meet our requirements
 we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases.

Most
of the raw materials we use are available from only a few suppliers. If these suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements
we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases. Changing suppliers can require long lead times. The failure of our suppliers
to meet our needs could occur for many reasons
 including fires
 natural disasters
 weather
 manufacturing problems
 disease
crop failure
 strikes
 transportation interruption
 government regulation
 political instability and terrorism. A failure of supply
could also occur due to suppliers&rsquo; financial difficulties
 including bankruptcy. Any significant interruption to supply
or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance.

Substantial
disruption to production at our third party beverage co-packing facilities and our storage facilities could occur
 which could
disrupt or delay our production or cause us to incur substantially higher costs.

Our
products are currently produced by three established co-packing companies. A disruption in our production at
 or our relationships
with
 our third party beverage co-packing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition
 a disruption
could occur at any of our storage facilities or those of our suppliers
 co-packers or distributors. The disruption could occur
for many reasons
 including fire
 natural disasters
 weather
 manufacturing problems
 disease
 strikes
 transportation interruption
government regulation or terrorism. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available
 may
cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production
 each of which could negatively affect our business
and financial performance.

We
rely
 in part
 on our third party beverage co-packing facilities to maintain the quality of our products. The failure or inability
of this co-manufacturer to comply with the specifications and requirements of our products could result in product recall and
could adversely affect our reputation.

We
take great care in ensuring the quality and safety in the manufacture of our products. Our third-party co-manufacturer is required
to maintain the quality of our products and to comply with our product specifications and requirements for certain certifications.
Our third-party co-manufacturer is also required to comply with Food and Drug Administration requirements for manufacturing of
our product. However
 our products could still otherwise become contaminated. A contamination could occur in our operations or
those of our bottlers
 distributors or suppliers. This could result in expensive production interruptions
 recalls and liability
claims. Moreover
 negative publicity could be generated from false
 unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls.
Any of these failures or occurrences could negatively affect our business and financial performance.

We
may be subject to litigation. The cost of defending against such litigation and the negative publicity related to such litigation
may adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.

From
time to time in the normal course of our business operations
 we may become subject to litigation that may result in liability
or negatively affect our operating results. The cost to defend such litigation may be significant and may require a diversion
of our resources. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception
of our business
 regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result
 litigation
may adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. For more information

Fluctuations
in our results of operations from quarter to quarter could have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition and
results of operations.

We
experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues and operating income. Historically
 sales during the second and third fiscal quarters
have generally been the highest. Any factors that harm our second or third quarter operating results
 including adverse weather
or unfavorable economic conditions
 could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year.
Unusually cool weather during the summer months may result in reduced demand for our products and have a negative effect on our
business and financial performance.

In
order to prepare for our peak selling season
 we must produce and keep in stock more inventory than we would carry at other times
of the year. Any unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during our peak selling season could require us to sell excess
inventory at a substantial markdown
 which could reduce our net sales and gross profit.

A
deterioration of global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry
 business and result of operations.

Disruptions
in the global credit and financial markets and in economic conditions generally may include diminished liquidity and credit availability
a decline in consumer confidence
 a decline in economic growth
 an increased unemployment rate and uncertainty about economic
stability. Such disruptions may affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways
 making it difficult to accurately forecast
and plan our future business activities. Any adverse global economic conditions and tightening of credit in financial markets
may lead consumers to postpone spending
 which may cause our customers to cancel
 decrease or delay their existing and future
orders with us. In addition
 financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers
 manufacturers
 distributors or customers could
result in product delays
 increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. We are unable to predict the likely
duration and severity of disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions.

Our
sales growth is dependent upon maintaining our relationships with existing distributors and retailers and the loss of any one
such distributor or retailer could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance.

Certain
retailers that we service primarily through our distributors make up a significant percentage of our products&rsquo; retail volume
including volume sold by our bottlers and distributors. We also sell directly to certain retail accounts and to the distribution
facilities of such retailers. Some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands.
For the year ended December 31
 2016
 two customers
 Seba Distribution LLC and Garden Foods accounted for 20% and 11%
of our net sales
 respectively. For the year ended December 31
 2015
 one customer
 Wakefern Food Corp.
 accounted for 10%
of net sales. The loss of sales of any of our products in a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business
and financial performance.

Food
and beverage retailers in the U.S. have been consolidating which may reduce our ability to increase both our revenue and our gross
margins.

Consolidation
has resulted in large
 sophisticated retailers with increased buying power. They are in a better position to resist our price
increases and demand lower prices. They also have leverage to require us to provide larger
 more tailored promotional and product
delivery programs. If we
 and our bottlers and distributors
 do not successfully provide appropriate marketing
 product
 packaging
pricing and service to these retailers
 our product availability
 sales and margins could suffer.

We
do not have any contracts with our customers that require the purchase of a minimum amount of our products. The absence of such
contracts could result in periods during which we must continue to pay costs and service indebtedness with reduced sales.

Our
customers do not provide us with firm
 long-term or short-term volume purchase commitments. As a result of the absence of such
contracts
 we could have periods during which we have no or limited orders for our products
 but we will continue to have to pay
our costs
 including those to maintain our work force and service our indebtedness with reduced sales. We cannot assure you that
we will be able to timely find new customers to supplement periods where we experience no or limited purchase orders or that we
can recover fixed costs as a result of experiencing reduced purchase orders. Periods of no or limited purchase orders for our
products could have a material adverse effect on our net income and cause us to incur losses. Conversely
 we may experience unanticipated
increased orders for our products from these customers that can create supply chain problems and may result in orders we may be
unable to meet. Unanticipated fluctuations in product requirements by our customers could result in fluctuations in our results
from quarter to quarter.


    
    


We
have developed a gallon product line in which our gross margins are minimal
 and therefore may not generate sufficient revenues
or other benefits to justify its introduction. In addition
 the gallon product line may divert sales from our higher margin 20oz
product line
 which would adversely affect our business.

In
May 2015
 we developed a gallon product line featuring five of our existing flavors. Our gross margins on this product line are
minimal. Accordingly
 this product line may not generate sufficient revenues or other benefits to justify its introduction. In
addition
 to the extent distributors choose to carry the gallon product line instead of our higher margin 20oz product line
 it
may negatively affect our operating results
 specifically our gross margin. Although we believe the gallon size has a different
function and manner of consumption
 consumers may choose to purchase the gallon size instead of the 20oz size
 because the gallon
size offers a better per ounce value. This would result in an overall lower gross margin for our business.

We
do not have registered ownership of certain of our trade names and our intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could
infringe the intellectual property rights of others
 and adverse events regarding licensed intellectual property
 including termination
of distribution rights
 could harm our business.

We
possess intellectual property that is important to our business. This intellectual property includes our logo
 trademarks for
&ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Original Long Island Brand
&rdquo; various other trademarks
 copyrights
 patents
ingredient formulas
 business processes and other trade secrets. However
 we do not currently have registered ownership of the
trademark &ldquo;The Original Long Island Brand&rdquo; and do not have registered ownership on the principal register of the trademark
&ldquo;Long Island Iced Tea&rdquo; as described below. We and third parties
 including competitors
 could come into conflict over
intellectual property rights. Litigation could disrupt our business
 divert management attention and cost a substantial amount
to protect our rights or defend ourselves against claims. We cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our rights will
be sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights. Our business is also highly dependent upon our distribution
rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights
 including the right to our trade name and logo
 our brands
products and business could be harmed and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.

On
April 19
 2016
 the United States Patent and Trademark Officer
 or the &ldquo;USPTO
&rdquo; registered our mark &ldquo;Long Island
Iced Tea&rdquo; (Registration No. 4
943
056) on the supplemental register. Registration on the supplemental register allows the
use of the &ldquo;&reg;&rdquo; symbol
 blocks later filed applications for confusingly similar marks
 and allows us to sue infringers
in federal court
 which has well-settled case law and standards. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 the supplemental register does
not provide all the protection of a registration on the principal register. As with any other registered mark
 we may be open
to claims of others contesting the trademark.

In
addition
 we have filed trademark applications for &ldquo;The Original Long Island Brand&rdquo; as a standard character mark and
as a stylized mark
 which applications are pending review by the USPTO. The applications are for use of the trademarks with iced
tea
 tea based products
 juices
 water
 beverages and other similar products. We also plan to file for stylized marks protecting
certain other tag lines and product designs. With respect to the pending trademark applications for &ldquo;The Original Long Island
Brand&rdquo; (standard character mark and stylized mark)
 the USPTO has made an initial determination that both marks are geographically
descriptive. This determination is refutable and the USPTO has afforded us the opportunity to produce evidence to establish that
the marks have become distinctive of the goods in commerce. There can be no assurance that the USPTO will approve these applications.


    
    


If
we incur substantial debt
 it could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.

As
of December 31
 2016
 we had approximately $1
385
775 of total indebtedness
 consisting principally of a draw of $1
280
275 on
a fully collateralized line of credit that we maintain. In addition
 we may obtain up to a maximum of $3
500
000 in advances under
the Credit Agreement
 subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement
 including a requirement that we obtain prior
approval of Brentwood for each advance. While our existing level of debt is not substantial and we may pay interest that accrues
on any future loans under the Credit Agreement by capitalizing the interest and adding it to the principal balance of such loans
we may incur significant indebtedness in the future
 including through advances under the Credit Agreement
 and we may not be
able to generate sufficient cash to service such debt as cash payments become due. If new debt and/or new credit sources are added
to our existing debt and credit sources
 the related risks for us could intensify.

If
we incur substantial debt
 it could have important consequences. In particular
 it could:



    
    
require
    us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness
 thereby reducing the
    availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;

    
    
    

    
    
limit
    along with the restrictive covenants of our indebtedness
 among other things
 our ability to borrow additional funds;

    
    
    

    
    
limit
    our flexibility in planning for
 or reacting to
 changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate;

    
    
    

    
    
increase
    our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and

    
    
    

    
    
place
    us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.


In
addition
 if we are unable to make payments as they come due or comply with the restrictions and covenants in the Credit Agreement
or any other agreements governing our indebtedness
 there could be a default under the terms of such agreements. In such event
or if we are otherwise in default under the Credit Agreement or such other agreements
 including pursuant to any cross-default
provisions of such agreements
 the lenders could terminate their commitments to lend and/or accelerate the loans and declare all
amounts borrowed due and payable. Furthermore
 our lenders under the Credit Agreement could foreclose on their security interests
in our assets
 including the equity interests in our material subsidiaries. If any of those events occur
 our assets might not
be sufficient to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness and we may be unable to find alternative financing. Even if
we could obtain alternative financing
 it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Additionally
 we may not
be able to amend the Credit Agreement or obtain needed waivers on satisfactory terms or without incurring substantial costs. Failure
to maintain existing or secure new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position.

The
loss of the services of our key personnel could negatively affect our business
 as could our inability to attract and retain qualified
management
 sales and technical personnel as and when needed.

The
execution of our business strategy depends largely on the continued efforts of our executive management
 including Julian Davidson
(our Executive Chairman)
 Philip Thomas (co-founder of LIBB and our Chief Executive Officer)
 Richard Allen (our Chief Financial
Officer) and Peter Dydensborg (our Chief Operating Officer). As we have a limited operating history
 we are highly dependent
upon these individuals&rsquo; knowledge
 experience and reputation within the industry. Any or all of these individuals may in
the future choose to discontinue their employment with us. If so
 we may not be able to find adequate replacements for them. Without
their experience
 expertise and reputation
 our development efforts and future prospects would be substantially impaired. We have
employment agreements in place with these individuals that include non-competition provisions.

We
may not comply with applicable government laws and regulations
 and they could change. Any violations could result in reputational
damage or substantial penalties
 and any changes could result in increased compliance costs.

We
are subject to a variety of federal
 state and local laws and regulations in the U.S.
 and other countries in which we do business.
These laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture
 safety
 labeling
 transportation
advertising and sale of our products. Violations of these laws or regulations could damage our reputation and/or result in regulatory
actions with substantial penalties. In addition
 any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation
 or
the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or capital
expenditures. For example
 changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase
our costs. Regulatory focus on the health
 safety and marketing of food products is increasing. Certain state warning and labeling
laws
 such as California&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prop 65
&rdquo; which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state
lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects
 could become applicable to our products. Some local and regional governments
and school boards have enacted
 or have proposed to enact
 regulations restricting the sale of certain types of soft drinks in
schools. Any violations or changes of regulations could have a material adverse effect on our profitability
 or disrupt the production
or distribution of our products
 and negatively affect our business and financial performance.


    
    



Our
ability to grow and compete in the future will be adversely affected if adequate capital is not available to us or not available
on terms favorable to us.

The
ability of our business to grow and compete depends on the availability of adequate capital. We currently have negative cash flows
from operations due in part to lower gross margins and operating expenses to build out our infrastructure and fulfil our public
company obligations. We expect that our working capital
 proceeds from recent stock offerings
 and the commitment for financing
from certain stockholders will be sufficient to meet our net cash requirements through March 31
 2018. However
 we may require
additional capital in the future to finance our growth strategy or for other purposes. In such event
 we cannot assure you that
we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on acceptable terms or at all. As a result
 we cannot assure you that adequate
capital will be available to finance our current growth plans
 take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive
pressures
 any of which could harm our business.

We
have a limited operating history and history of operating losses
 and there is no guarantee that we will achieve profitability.

We
have a limited operating history and a history of operating losses. There is no guarantee that we will become a profitable business.
Further
 our future operating results depend upon a number of factors
 including our ability to manage our growth
 retain our
customer base and to successfully identify and respond to emerging trends in our market areas.

While
we currently produce only non-alcoholic beverages
 we are exploring entry into the alcoholic beverage industry. To the extent
that we expand our operations into new sectors of the beverage industry
 our business operations may suffer from a lack of experience
significant costs of entry and the competitive conditions in the market
 among other factors
 which could materially and adversely
affect our business
 financial condition
 results of operations and cash flows.

We
are exploring entry into the alcoholic beverage industry. As we principally have been engaged in the production of NARTD teas
we have limited experience with developing
 producing
 marketing and distributing alcoholic beverages. Additionally
 we will be
exposed to significant operating costs associated with developing new products and entering a new sector of the beverage industry
and will face new regulatory burdens
 which could have an adverse impact on our business as well as place us at a disadvantage
relative to more established alcoholic beverage market participants. Furthermore
 the alcoholic beverage industry is highly competitive.
We will compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources. These competitors can use their resources
and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products
 reducing
prices or increasing promotional activities. In addition:



    
    
We
    may not be able to adequately distinguish our alcohol products from our non-alcohol products. Our inability to create the
    proper differentiation could result in customer confusion and could have adverse regulatory consequences.

    
    
    

    
    
We
    may not be able establish the proper infrastructure to support the supply chain from the manufacturing of the product to the
    ultimate purchase by the end consumer.



    
    


As
a result of the foregoing factors
 we may be unsuccessful in expanding our business to include alcoholic beverages. Furthermore
attempting such an expansion will require a substantial investment of resources and management time
 which could materially adversely
affect our more established non-alcoholic beverage business as well. Accordingly
 we can offer no assurance that if we expand
our business beyond NARTD teas
 we will be able to effectively develop
 produce
 market and distribute such beverages. Such failure
could materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition
 results of operations and cash flows.

Risks
Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock

We
do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.

We
have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date. Any future decisions regarding dividends will be made by our board
of directors. We do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future
 but expect to retain earnings to finance the growth
of our business. Therefore
 any return on investments will only occur if the market price of our common stock appreciates.

A
robust public market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained
 which could affect your ability to sell our common
stock or depress the market price of our common stock.

Our
common stock is listed on NASDAQ
 but we cannot assure you that our common stock will continue to trade on this market or another
national securities exchange. In addition
 we are unable to predict whether an active trading market for our common stock will
develop or will be sustained.

The
trading price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.

The
price and volume of our common stock may be volatile and subject to fluctuations. Our stock has traded at a low of $3.73 to a
high of $12.55 in since January 1
 2016. Some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in the stock price or trading volume
of our common stock include:



    
    
general
    market and economic conditions and market trends
 including in the beverage industry and the financial markets generally;

    
    
    

    
    
the
    political
 economic and social situation in the U.S.;

    
    
    

    
    
actual
    or expected variations in operating results;

    
    
    

    
    
announcements
    by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions
 strategic partnerships
 joint ventures
 capital commitments
 or other
    business developments;

    
    
    

    
    
adoption
    of new accounting standards affecting the industry in which we operate;

    
    
    

    
    
operations
    and stock performance of competitors;

    
    
    

    
    
litigation
    or governmental action involving or affecting us or our subsidiaries;

    
    
    

    
    
recruitment
    or departure of key personnel;

    
    
    

    
    
purchase
    or sales of blocks of our common stock; and

    
    
    

    
    
operating
    and stock performance of the companies that investors may consider to be comparable.


There
can be no assurance that the price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly. The stock market in recent
years has experienced considerable price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating
performance of individual companies and that could materially adversely affect the price of our common stock
 regardless of our
operating performance. You should also be aware that price volatility might be worse if the trading volume of shares of our common
stock is low
 as it historically has been.


    
    


Our
outstanding warrants and options will increase the number of shares outstanding and available for sale in the public markets
which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.

We
presently have outstanding (i) stock options to purchase 862
964 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise
price of $4.77 per share held by certain of our executive officers
 directors and employees
 (ii) warrants to purchase
up to 404
475 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.00 per share that were issued in the private placements described
herein
 (iii) warrants to purchase up to 34
573 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.50 per share that were issued
to Network 1 and its designees as compensation for acting as the placement agent for such private placements
 and (iv) warrants
to purchase up to 31
522 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.50 per share that were issued to Network 1 and its
designees as compensation for acting as the placement agent for the Public Offering
 and (v) warrants to purchase up to 165
000
shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.18 per share that were issued to a stockholder in consideration of a commitment
to fund the Company. If and to the extent these warrants and options are exercised
 you may experience dilution to your holdings
and/or it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock also may be
adversely affected
 if and to the extent the shares registered for resale pursuant to this prospectus are sold in the public markets.

The
substantial number of shares that are eligible for sale pursuant to our resale registration statement could cause the market price
for our common stock to decline or make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future.

We
have an effective registration statement registering the resale by certain of our stockholders of up to 4
348
889 shares of our
common stock. Expectations that shares of our common stock may be sold by the selling stockholders could create an &ldquo;overhang&rdquo;
that may adversely affect the market price for our common stock.

We
cannot predict the effect on the market price of our common stock from time to time as a result of (i) sales by the stockholders
of some or all of the 4
348
889 shares of our common stock under our resale registration statement
 (ii) the availability of such
shares of common stock for sale by the selling stockholders
 or (iii) the perception that such shares may be offered for sale
by the selling stockholders. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market
 or the perception
that those sales will occur
 could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or make future offerings of our equity
securities more difficult. Any sale
 or perceived impending sale
 of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could
cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.

We
have the ability to issue additional shares of common stock and &ldquo;blank check&rdquo; preferred stock
 which could affect
the rights of holders of the common stock.

Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue 35
000
000 shares of common stock and
1
000
000 shares of preferred stock and to set the terms of such preferred stock. We have 25
108
400 authorized but unissued
shares of common stock available for issuance after appropriate reservation for our outstanding options and warrants. The issuance
of additional common stock may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing stockholders. In addition
 the terms of such
preferred stock may materially adversely impact the dividend and liquidation rights of holders of the common stock.

Provisions
in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us
 which could limit the
price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.

Our
charter contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best
interests. These provisions include a staggered board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the
terms of and issue new series of preferred stock. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law
 which could
delay or prevent a change of control. Together
 these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage
transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.


    
    


Our
senior executive officers and directors may not be able to successfully manage a publicly traded company.

Not
all of our senior executive officers or directors have extensive experience managing a publicly traded company
 and they may not
be successful in doing so. The demands of managing a publicly traded company
 like ours
 is much greater as compared to those
of a private company
 and some of our senior executive officers and directors may not be able to successfully meet those increased
demands.

We
are an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging
growth companies will make our common shares less attractive to investors.

We
are an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (&ldquo;JOBS Act&rdquo;)
and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies.
These exemptions include not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (&ldquo;Sarbanes-Oxley&rdquo;)
 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports
and proxy statements
 and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and
stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Investors may find our common stock less attractive
because we rely
 or may rely
 on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result
 the price
of our common stock may be reduced
 there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common
stock may be more volatile.

In
addition
 under the JOBS Act
 &ldquo;emerging growth companies&rdquo; can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until
such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption
from new or revised accounting standards and
 therefore
 we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as
other public companies that are not &ldquo;emerging growth companies.&rdquo;

We
could remain an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; until December 31
 2020
 although a variety of circumstances could cause
us to lose that status earlier. For as long as we take advantage of the reduced reporting obligations
 the information that we
provide stockholders may be different from information provided by other public companies.

Obligations
associated with being a public company require significant company resources and management attention
 which may have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

We
are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended
 or the &ldquo;Exchange Act
&rdquo;
and the other rules and regulations of the SEC
 including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Exchange Act requires
 among other things
that we file annual
 quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act requires
 among other things
 that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting. These reporting and other obligations place significant demands on our management
 administrative
 operational and
accounting resources
 make certain activities more time-consuming and cause us to incur significant legal
 accounting and other
expenses. In order to comply with these obligations
 we may need to upgrade our systems or create new systems
 implement additional
financial and management controls
 reporting systems and procedures
 expand or outsource our internal audit function
 and hire
additional accounting and finance staff. Because our resources are limited compared to many public companies
 these requirement
may impose a disproportionate financial burden on us. Furthermore
 our limited management resources may exacerbate the difficulties
in complying with these reporting and other requirements and prevent us from focusing on executing our business strategy. In addition
if we are unable to comply with the financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies
 the market
price of our common stock could be adversely affected.

As
an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; and a &ldquo;smaller reporting company&rdquo; we intend to continue to take advantage
of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &ldquo;emerging
growth companies&rdquo; or &ldquo;smaller reporting companies
&rdquo; including
 but not limited to
 not being required to comply
with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive
compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and other scaled disclosure requirements
 and exemptions from the requirements
of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not
previously approved. In general
 we will remain an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; until December 31
 2020
 although a variety
of circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier
 and will remain a &ldquo;smaller reporting company&rdquo; for each
fiscal year where our public float remains below $75 million as of the last day of the second fiscal quarter of the prior fiscal
year. We intend to take advantage of some or all of these exemptions and reduced reporting requirements until we are no longer
an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; and/or a &ldquo;smaller reporting company
&rdquo; at which time
 we expect to incur significant
additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with these additional requirements.

not include beneficial owners of common stock whose shares are held in the names of banks
 brokers and other nominees.



We
have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date. Any future decisions regarding dividends will be made by our board
of directors. We do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future
 but expect to retain earnings to finance the growth
of our business. Our board of directors has complete discretion on whether to pay dividends. Even if our board of directors decides
to pay dividends
 the form
 frequency and amount will depend upon our future operations and earnings
 capital requirements and
surplus
 general financial condition
 contractual restrictions and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant.

MANAGEMENT&rsquo;S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Executive
Summary



We
are a holding company operating through our wholly-owned subsidiary
 LIBB. We are engaged in the production and distribution of
premium NARTD beverages. We are currently organized around our flagship iced tea product
 under the brand Long Island
. The Long Island Iced Tea name for a cocktail originated in Long Island in the 1970&rsquo;s
 and its
national recognition is such that it is ranked as the fourth most popular cocktail in restaurants and bars in the U.S. (Source:
Nielsen CGA
 On-Premise Consumer Survey
 2016). Our premium NARTD tea is made from a proprietary recipe and with quality components.
 is sold in 27 states across the U.S.
 primarily on the East Coast
 through a network of
national and regional retail chains and distributors.


    
    



Since
February 2016
 we have been engaged in the aloe juice business
 under the brand ALO Juice. ALO Juice is a NARTD functional
beverage made from juice derived from the aloe plant known as aloe vera. ALO Juice sources its aloe plants from harvests in Thailand.
The plants are exported from there to South Korea where they are processed in a unique whole leaf manner to ensure the nutritional
and health benefits are maintained from the plant all the way through to the bottling process.

On
March 14
 2017
 we announced the expansion of our brand with the launch of The Original Long Island Brand&trade; Lemonade. This
lemonade is a NARTD functional beverage made from a proprietary recipe with quality components.

Our
mission is to provide consumers with &ldquo;better-for-you&rdquo; premium beverages offered at an affordable price.

We
aspire to be a market leader in the development of beverages that are convenient and appealing to consumers. There are two major
target markets for our beverages: consumers on the go and health conscious consumers. Consumers on the go are families
employees
 students and other consumers who lead a busy lifestyle. With increasingly hectic and demanding schedules
 there is
a need for products that are accessible and readily available. Health conscious consumers are individuals who are becoming more
interested and better educated on what is included in their diets
 causing them to shift away from options perceived as less healthy
such as CSDs towards alternative beverages such as iced tea.

We
continually seek to expand our product line. We are exploring entry into the $222 billion U.S. alcohol industry
 with the hope
to establish ourselves as a multi-product alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage company.

We
also continually seek to better develop emerging markets
 as well as expand our overall geographic footprint. We entered
into new business arrangements involving international specialists contracted to (i) identify new market opportunities and (ii)
assist in the overall management of our international expansion efforts. During 2016
 the company announced new distributorships
in Columbia
 Honduras
 Dominican Republic
 St Martin and Bermuda. We also worked alongside new distributor partnerships in Puerto
Rico
 Canada and South Korea to further expand distribution points throughout their respective markets. New developments included
(i) new retail partnerships opened with supermarket chains such as Pueblos and Supermax in Puerto Rico
 (ii) our first shipment
to Canada in November 2016
 and (iii) multiple reorders received from the South Korean distributor.

We
were incorporated on December 23
 2014 in the State of Delaware. Our corporate offices are located at 116 Charlotte Avenue
 Hicksville
NY 11801 and our telephone number at that location is (855) 542-2832.



We
generate income through the sale of our NARTD beverage. The following are highlights of our operating results for the years ended
December 31
 2016 and 2015:



    
    
Net
    sales
 2016
 we had net sales of $4
558
030
 representing an increase of $2
658
800
    over the year ended December 31
 2015. The increase is due to a combination of brand momentum and an increase in distribution
    including $1
054
990 in sales of our new aloe juice products. The increase was also bolstered by an increase of $891
665
    in the sale of our iced tea in gallon containers
 which helped us to gain incremental distribution and shelf space
    in target retail outlets.

    
    
    

    
    
.
    Our margin decreased by 11% for the year ended December 31
 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31
 2015. There were
    two primary reasons for the decreased margins during the year ended December 31
 2016. The first reason for the decrease was
    due to the fact that
 beginning May 2015
 we introduced and are selling five of our iced tea flavors in gallon containers.
    Sales of our gallon containers have and continue to be sold below their cost in order to drive expanded distribution and brand
    visibility to consumers on retail store shelves. As a result
 during the year ended December 31
 2016 our negative margin
    on the sale of iced tea gallon containers was $299
671 as compared to a negative margin of $21
669 for the year ended December
    31
 2015. The second reason for the decrease was that during 2015
 we received a one-time cost reduction of approximately
    $120
000 from a supplier that did not reoccur in 2016. These negative factors were partially offset by the introduction of
    sales through vending machines and the aloe juice product line
 which together have positively impacted our margins.



    
    





    
    
Operating
    expenses
 2016
 our operating expenses were $8
107
786
 an increase of $4
712
467 as
    compared to the year ended December 31
 2015. The increases in operating expenses for the year ended December 31
 2016 related
    primarily to increased staffing costs as we build out our organization (including stock based compensation)
 increases in
    Advisory Board and Board of Directors fees
 increases in legal
 professional
 consulting
 and investor relations expenses
    and an increase in printing and filing fees
 principally on account of the full year impact of being a public company.


Historically
our cash generated from operations has not been sufficient to meet our expenses. During 2016
 we have most significantly financed
our business through the sale of equity interests. During the year ended December 31
 2016
 our cash flows used in operations
were $6
472
204 and our net cash provided by financing activities was $9
924
974. We had working capital of $3
518
886 as of December
31
 2016.

In
order to execute our long-term growth strategy
 we expect to continue to raise additional funds through equity offerings
 debt
financings
 or other means. There are no assurances that we will be able to raise such funds on acceptable terms or at all.

Uncertainties
and Trends in Our Business

We
believe that the key uncertainties and trends in our business are as follows:



    
    
We
    believe that using various marketing tools
 which may result in significant advertising expenses
 will be necessary in order
    to increase product awareness in order to compete with our competitors
 including large and well established brands with access
    to significant capital resources.

    
    
    

    
    
Customer
    trends and tastes can change for a variety of reasons including health consciousness
 government regulations and variation
    in demographics. We will need to be able to adapt to changing preferences in the future.

    
    
    

    
    
Our
    sales growth is dependent upon maintaining our relationships with existing and future customers who may generate substantial
    portions of our revenue
 which includes sales to retailers where there may be concentrations. 

    
    
    

    
    
Our
    sales are subject to seasonality. Our sales are typically the strongest in the summer months in the northeastern United States.

    
    
    

    
    
We
    are currently involved in litigation. Please refer to Item 3 of Part I of this Form 10-K. There are no assurances that there
    will be successful outcomes to these matters.

    
    
    

    
    
We
    developed a gallon product line featuring five of our existing flavors. The Company&rsquo;s gallon product line has previously
    sold below cost. There are no assurance we will be successful in increasing margins on this product line.

    
    
    

    
    
We
                                         operate in highly competitive markets.

    
    
    

    
    
We
    are exploring potential opportunities to expand our business to include alcoholic beverages. This expansion may require a
    substantial investment of resources and management time
 and there can be no assurances that our efforts will be successful.



    
    




    
    
Costs
    for our raw materials may increase substantially.

    
    
    

    
    
Our
    intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others
 and adverse
    events regarding licensed intellectual property
 including termination of distribution rights
 could harm our business.

    
    
    

    
    
We
    have experienced cash losses from operations and our ability to grow and compete in the future will be adversely affected
    if adequate capital is not available to us.

    
    
    

    
    
We
    have a limited operating history.


Critical
Accounting Policies

The
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities
 revenues and expenses
 and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in these consolidated financial statements. We believe that
 of our significant
accounting policies (see Note 2 of the financial statements included in this Form 10-K)
 the following policies are the most critical.

Revenue
Recognition

Revenue
is stated net of sales discounts and rebates paid to customers. Net sales are recognized when all of the following conditions
are met: (1) the price is fixed and determined; (2) evidence of a binding arrangement exists (generally
 purchase orders); (3)
products have been delivered and there is no future performance required; and (4) amounts are collectible under normal payment
terms. These conditions typically occur when the products are delivered to or picked up by the Company&rsquo;s customers. For
sales where certain revenue recognition criteria have not been met at the date of delivery
 the Company defers recognition of
such revenue until such recognition criteria are met.

Customer
Marketing Programs and Sales Incentives

The
Company participates in various programs and arrangements with customers designed to increase the sale of its products. Among
these programs are arrangements under which allowances can be earned by customers for attaining agreed upon sales levels or for
participating in specific marketing programs. The Company believes that its participation in these programs is essential to ensuring
volume and revenue growth in a competitive marketplace. The costs of all these various programs are recorded as a reduction of
sales in the consolidated financial statements.

Additionally
the Company may be required to occasionally pay fees to its customers (&ldquo;Placement Fees&rdquo;) in order to place its products
in the customers&rsquo; stores. In most cases
 the Placement Fees carry no further benefit or minimum revenue guarantee other
than the right to place the Company&rsquo;s product in the customers&rsquo; stores. The Placement Fees are recorded as a reduction
of sales. If
 at the time the Placement Fees are recognized in the statement of operations
 the Company has cumulative negative
sales with that particular customer
 such negative sales are reclassified and recorded as a part of selling and marketing expense.

Accounts
Receivable

The
Company sells products to distributors and in certain cases directly to retailers
 and extends credit
 generally without requiring
collateral
 based on its evaluation of the customer&rsquo;s financial condition. Potential losses on the Company&rsquo;s receivables
are dependent on each individual customer&rsquo;s financial condition and sales adjustments granted after the balance sheet date.
The Company carries its trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. Typically
 accounts receivable have terms of net 30
days and do not bear interest. The Company monitors its exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential
losses or adjustments. The Company determines these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables; (2) analyzing its
history of sales adjustments; and (3) reviewing its high-risk customers. Past due receivable balances are written off when the
Company&rsquo;s efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due. Accounts receivable are stated at the amounts management
expects to collect. For sales where certain revenue recognition criteria have not been met at the date of delivery
 the Company
defers recognition of such accounts receivable until such recognition criteria are met.


    
    





The
Company&rsquo;s inventory includes raw materials such as bottles
 sweeteners
 labels
 flavors and packaging. Finished goods inventory
consists of bottled and packaged iced tea and ALO Juice. The Company values its inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable
value. Cost is determined using the first-in
 first-out (FIFO) method. Included in inventory at December 31
 2016 was finished
goods inventory with a cost of approximately $320
000 that was delivered to a distributor
 and is held in inventory until such
revenue recognition criteria are met.

Business
Combination

For
accounting purposes
 the Business Combination was treated as an acquisition of Cullen by LIBB and as a recapitalization of LIBB
as the former LIBB members hold a large percentage of the Company&rsquo;s shares and exercise significant influence over the operating
and financial policies of the consolidated entity and the Company was a public shell company at the time of the transaction. Pursuant
to Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) 805-10-55-11 through 55-15
 the merger or acquisition of a private operating
company into a non-operating public shell with nominal assets is considered a capital transaction in substance rather than a business
combination. As a result
 the condensed consolidated balance sheet
 statement of operations
 and statement of cash flows of LIBB
have been retroactively updated to reflect the recapitalization. Additionally
 the historical condensed consolidated financial
statements of LIBB are now reflected as those of the Company.

Net
Sales and Gross Profit

Net
sales for the year ended December 31
 2016 increased by $2
658
800
 or 140%
 to $4
558
030 as compared to $1
899
230 for the year
ended December 31
 2015. The increase is due to a combination of iced tea brand momentum and an increase in distribution. During
the year ended December 31
 2016
 our iced tea product distribution expanded into 11 additional states and into over 1
000 new
retail outlets. The increase was also bolstered by the sale of the Company&rsquo;s iced tea product line in gallon containers.
Net sales of our iced tea product in gallons during the year ended December 31
 2016 increased by $891
665 and were $1
243
074
as compared to $351
409 for the year ended December 31
 2015. During 2016
 we began selling our iced tea and other purchased products
in vending machines. Vending machine sales were $185
285 during the 2016 year. During the first quarter of 2016
 we began selling
a line of aloe juice products realizing year one revenues of $1
054
990.

Gross
profit decreased by $24
377
 or 7%
 to $318
713 for the year ended December 31
 2016 from $343
090 for the year ended December
31
 2015. Our gross profit percentage decreased to 7% for the year ended December 31
 2016 as compared to 18% for the year ended
December 31
 2015. The decrease in gross profit percentage was due to (a) selling our gallon containers at or below costs to certain
distributors in order to acquire more shelf space and consumer visibility for the brand; (b) an increase in costs to produce certain
new package offerings for our 20oz product line; and (c) introductory pricing given to new customers on our 20oz product line
during the year ended December 31
 2016.

General
and administrative expenses

General
and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31
 2016 increased by $3
011
806
 or 155%
 to $4
958
076 as compared to
$1
946
270 for the year ended December 31
 2015. This increase was principally the result of our efforts to build out our management
and support team to support our growth
 enhance our corporate governance and the effects of bearing public company costs for the
full year of 2016. Specifically
 our personnel costs increased by approximately $524
000 in connection with hiring our executive
chairman
 chief financial officer and other supporting personnel. We incurred an increase of approximately $1
013
585 in stock-based
compensation costs
 an increase of approximately $252
000 in costs in connection with the compensation of our Board of Directors
and Advisory Board and an increase of approximately $520
000 in the costs of being a public company
 consisting principally of
legal
 accounting
 filing and related costs. The remainder of the cost increases primarily related to costs incurred in support
of the expansion of business
 including increases in rent and storage fees
 insurance costs
 website and internet costs and depreciation
expense related to the purchase of vending machines in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Selling
and marketing expenses

Selling
and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31
 2016 increased by $1
700
661
 or 117%
 to $3
149
710 as compared to $1
449
049
for the year ended December 31
 2015. The increase was principally the result of key management hires to expand the capabilities
of the sales and marketing organization
 strategic spending in support of brand and investor awareness and increases in freight
out and other costs consistent with the revenue growth. Specifically
 our personnel cost increased by approximately $250
568 in
connection with the hiring of our vice president of national sales and marketing and other supporting personnel. We incurred an
increase of $85
000 in stock-based compensation costs. Sales commissions paid to brokers increased by approximately $64
000 in
support of new sales distribution. Our investor and public relations costs increased by $719
609
 consisting of $513
940 in cash
costs and $205
669 for stock-based compensation. We incurred an increase of approximately $127
596 in connection with our exploration
of opportunities for expansion into the liquor industry. Freight out increased by $293
434 during the year ended December 31
2016 as compared to the year ended December 31
 2015 due to increased volume as well as increased freight rates resulting from
shipments from a storage facility located in Georgia.

Interest
expense

Interest
expense for the year ended December 31
 2016 increased by $942
256
 or 756%
 to $1
066
969 as compared to $124
713 for the year
ended December 31
 2015. Interest expense for the year ended December 31
 2016
 principally consisted of the amortization of deferred
financing costs of $995
550 (including a $408
000 charge to proportionally reduce the deferred financing costs with the reduction
of the credit facility) and interest of $72
226 in connection with the Brentwood line of credit.

Loss
on induced conversion of credit facility and warrants

During
the year ended December 31
 2016
 the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $1
587
954 for an induced conversion of its credit
facility and related warrants. No such charge was recorded during the year ended December 31
 2015.


    
    


Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Sources
of Liquidity

We
have most significantly financed our business through the sale of equity interests. We had working capital of $3
518
886 as of
December 31
 2016. We believe that
 as a result of proceeds from our recent common stock offerings
 the commitment for financing
from certain members of management and a stockholder and our working capital as of December 31
 2016 that our cash resources will
be sufficient to fund our net cash requirements through March 31
 2018.

We
also rely on debt to finance our business. The following table provides an overview of our borrowings as of December 31
 2016:

On July 29
 2016
 all outstanding principal and interest under the Brentwood line of credit was converted into 421
972 shares
of common stock in connection with closing of the Offering. No further draws have been made under the line of credit.

Below
is a summary of our financing activities during the last two fiscal years. In order to execute our long-term growth strategy
including the expansion of the business to include alcoholic beverages
 we may need to continue to raise additional funds through
private equity offerings
 debt financings
 or other means. There are no assurances that we will be able to raise such funds on
acceptable terms or at all.

Financing
Activity

Line
of Credit 

On
November 23
 2015
 we entered into the Credit Agreement with LIBB and Brentwood. Brentwood is controlled by Eric Watson
 who as
of March 27
 2017 beneficially owned approximately 17.3% of our outstanding common stock. The Credit Agreement provided for a
revolving Credit Facility in an initial available amount (the &ldquo;Available Amount&rdquo;) of up to $1
000
000
 subject to
increases as provided in the Credit Agreement
 up to a maximum Facility Amount of $5
000
000. The loans under the Credit Agreement
were evidenced by Brentwood.

The
initial Available Amount available under the Credit Facility was advanced to us in two installments
 the first $350
000 having
been advanced on November 23
 2015 and the next $650
000 having been advanced on December 10
 2015. On March 17
 2016
 Brentwood
approved an increase of $500
000 in the Available Amount under the Credit Agreement and approved advances in the same amount.
On March 24
 2016
 an advance of $250
000 was received by the Company
 and an additional advance of $250
000 was received during
May 2016. The proceeds of the Credit Facility are to be used for the purposes disclosed in writing to Brentwood in connection
with each advance. As of December 31
 2016 and December 31
 2015
 the outstanding balance of the loans under the Credit Facility
was $0 and $1
091
571
 respectively.

The
Credit Facility bears interest at rate equal to the prime rate plus 7.5%
 compounded quarterly
 and matures on November 23
 2018.
As of December 31
 2015
 $4
071 of interest has been compounded and added to the principal balance of the loans. The outstanding
principal and interest under the Credit Facility are payable in cash on the maturity date. We also paid Brentwood a one-time facility
fee equal to 1.75% of the Facility Amount
 which was capitalized and added to the principal amount of the loan
 and will pay Brentwood
$30
000 for its expenses at the maturity date. The Credit Facility is secured by a first priority security interest in all of
our property
 including the membership interests in LIBB held by us. We also have guaranteed the repayment of LIBB&rsquo;s obligations
under the Credit Facility. In addition
 LIBB&rsquo;s obligations are guaranteed by Philip Thomas
 our Chief Executive Officer
in certain limited circumstances
 up to a maximum of $200
000.


    
    


Brentwood
may accelerate the amounts due under the Credit Facility upon the occurrence of certain events of default
 including a failure
to make a payment under the credit facility when due
 a violation of the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement and related
documents
 a filing of a bankruptcy petition or a similar event with respect to us or the occurrence of an event of default under
other material indebtedness of ours. The Company and LIBB also made certain customary representations and warranties and covenants
including negative covenants with respect to the incurrence of indebtedness.

Brentwood
may elect to convert the outstanding principal and interest under Brentwood into shares of our common stock at a conversion price
of $4.00 per share. The conversion price and the shares of common stock or other property issuable upon conversion of the principal
and interest are subject to adjustment in the event of any stock split
 stock combination
 stock dividend or reclassification
of our common stock
 or in the event of a fundamental transaction.

In
addition
 in connection with the establishment of the Credit Facility
 we issued the Brentwood Warrant to Brentwood. The Brentwood
Warrant entitled the holder to purchase 1
111
111 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.50 and included
a cashless exercise provision.

In
connection with the closing of the Offering
 we completed the Recapitalization with Brentwood. Pursuant to the Recapitalization
all of the outstanding principal and interest under Brentwood was converted into 421
972 shares of common stock. Upon closing
of the Offering
 pursuant to the recapitalization
 the Brentwood Warrant was exchanged 486
111 shares of common stock. As of December
31
 2016
 the principal amount of loans outstanding was $0. In connection with the recapitalization the Facility Amount was reduced
to $3
500
000. Any amounts drawn from the Facility Amount require Brentwood&rsquo;s approval.

These
shares were registered for resale under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-213875)
which was declared effective by the SEC on January 31
 2017.

CONTROL
    AND PROCEDURES


Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified under
the rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed
to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and our
Chief Financial Officer
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As required by paragraph (b)
of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act
 our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive) and Chief Financial Officer
(our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31
 2016. Based on this evaluation
 our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in paragraph (e) of Rules
13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) were not effective as December 31
 2016 due to a material weakness in our internal control
over financial reporting as described below.

Limitations
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

An
internal control system over financial reporting has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation
and presentation. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
However
 these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore
 it is possible to design
into the process safeguards to reduce
 though not eliminate
 this risk.

Management&rsquo;s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
 as defined in Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process used to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Internal control over financial
reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States
 and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our board of
directors and management; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive)
and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer)
 we performed a complete documentation
of the Company&rsquo;s significant processes and key controls
 and conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control&mdash;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation
 management concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31
 2016 due to the material weakness described below.


    
    


A
material weakness is defined within the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board&rsquo;s Auditing Standard No. 5
 as a deficiency
or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting
 such that there is a reasonable possibility that
a material misstatement of the Company&rsquo;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. We determined that our internal control of financial reporting had the following material weakness:





    
    
Due
                                         to the small size of the Company
 the Company does not maintain sufficient segregation
                                         of duties to ensure the processing
 review and authorization of all transactions including
                                         non-routine transactions.
        

    
    
Our
    processes lacked timely and complete reviews and analysis of information used to prepare our financial statements and disclosures
    in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


The
Company is evaluating this weakness to determine the appropriate remedy. Because disclosure controls and procedures include those
components of internal control over financial reporting that provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 management also determined
that its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as a result of the foregoing material weakness in its internal
control over financial reporting.

This
Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting as such report is not required for smaller reporting companies.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

During
the quarter ended December 31
 2016
 the Company hired a full-time Controller. In connection with this hire
 the Company has made
improvements in routinization of its closing process that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect
our internal control over financial reporting.

There
have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required
by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the current fiscal quarter that have materially
affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

Family
Relationships

There
are no family relationships among any of the Company&rsquo;s directors or executive officers.

Leadership
Structure

The
Board is divided into two classes
 Class 1 and Class 2. The Class 1 directors will hold office until the annual meeting of directors
to be held in 2018 and the Class 2 directors will hold office until the annual meeting of directors to be held in 2017. Thereafter
each director holds office until the second succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after his or her election
 or until his
or her death
 resignation
 removal or the earlier termination of his or her term of office. Edward Hanson
 Kerry Kennedy and Richard
Y. Roberts are the Class 1 directors and Julian Davidson
 Philip Thomas
 Paul Vassilakos and Tom Cardella are the Class 2 directors.

The
Board has determined to keep the positions of chairman of the board and principal executive officer separate at this time. This
permits the Company&rsquo;s principal executive officer to concentrate his efforts on managing the Company&rsquo;s business operations
and development. This also allows the Company to maintain an independent chairman of the board who oversees
 among other things
communications and relations between the Board and senior management
 consideration by the Board of the Company&rsquo;s strategies
and policies and evaluation by the Board of the Company&rsquo;s principal executive officer.


    
    
    
Independence
of Directors

The
Company&rsquo;s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market and the Company adheres to the Nasdaq listing standards in
determining whether a director is independent. The Board consults with its counsel to ensure that its determinations are consistent
with those rules and all relevant securities and other laws and regulations regarding the independence of directors. Nasdaq requires
that a majority of the Board must be composed of &ldquo;independent directors
&rdquo; which is defined generally as a person other
than an officer of a company
 who does not have a relationship with the company that would interfere with the director&rsquo;s
exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Consistent with these considerations
 the
Company has determined that each of Messrs. Hanson
 Roberts and Cardella and Ms. Kennedy is an independent director.

Board
Role in Risk Oversight

The
Board&rsquo;s primary function is one of oversight. The Board as a whole works with the Company&rsquo;s management team to promote
and cultivate a corporate environment that incorporates enterprise-wide risk management into strategy and operations. Management
periodically reports to the Board about the identification
 assessment and management of critical risks and management&rsquo;s
risk mitigation strategies. Each committee of the Board is responsible for the evaluation of elements of risk management based
on the committee&rsquo;s expertise and applicable regulatory requirements. In evaluating risk
 the Board and its committees consider
whether the Company&rsquo;s programs adequately identify material risks in a timely manner and implement appropriately responsive
risk management strategies throughout the organization. The audit committee focuses on assessing and mitigating financial risk
including risk related to internal controls
 and receives at least quarterly reports from management on identified risk areas.
In setting compensation
 the compensation committee strives to create incentives that encourage behavior consistent with the Company&rsquo;s
business strategy
 without encouraging undue risk-taking. The nominating committee considers areas of potential risk within corporate
governance and compliance
 such as management succession. Each of the committees reports regularly to the Board as a whole as
to their findings with respect to the risks they are charged with assessing.

Board
Meetings and Committees

The
Board has three separately standing committees: the audit committee
 the compensation committee and the nominating committee.
Each committee is composed entirely of independent directors as determined in accordance with the rules of Nasdaq for directors
generally
 and where applicable
 with the rules of Nasdaq for such committee. In addition
 each committee has a written charter
a copy of which is available free of charge on the Company&rsquo;s website at http://investors.longislandicedtea.com/charters.

Audit

The
audit committee consists of Tom Cardella
 Edward Hanson and Richard Y. Roberts

inquiring and discussing
    with management the Company&rsquo;s compliance with applicable laws and regulations;

    of the services to be performed;

    
    
    

    
    
appointing
    or replacing the independent auditor;

    
    
    

    
    
determining
    the compensation and oversight of the work of the independent auditor (including resolution of disagreements between management
    and the independent auditor regarding financial reporting) for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or related
    work;

    
    
    

    
    
establishing
    procedures for the receipt

    and

    
    
    

    
    
reviewing
    and approving any related party transactions the Company may enter into. The audit committee will consider all relevant factors
    when determining whether to approve a related party transaction
 including whether the related party transaction is on terms
    no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and
    the extent of the related party&rsquo;s interest in the transaction.


Financial
Experts on Audit Committee

The
audit committee will at all times be composed exclusively of &ldquo;independent directors&rdquo; who are &ldquo;financially literate&rdquo;
as defined under the Nasdaq listing standards. The definition of &ldquo;financially literate&rdquo; generally means being able
to read and understand fundamental financial statements
 including a company&rsquo;s balance sheet
 income statement and cash
flow statement. The Company has determined that Edward Hanson qualifies as an &ldquo;audit committee financial expert
&rdquo;
as defined under rules and regulations of the SEC.

Compensation
Committee

The
compensation committee consists of Tom Cardella and Richard Y. Roberts
 each of whom is an independent director
 with Mr. Cardella
serving as chairman. The principal functions of the compensation committee are:



    
    
evaluating
    the performance of the Company&rsquo;s officers


    
    
    

    
    
reviewing
    any compensation payable to the Company&rsquo;s directors and officers


    
    
    

    
    
preparing
    compensation committee reports
 and

    
    
    

    
    
administering
    the issuance of any common stock or other equity awards granted to the Company&rsquo;s officers and directors.


The
compensation committee makes all decisions regarding executive officer compensation. The compensation committee periodically reviews
the elements of compensation for the executive officers and
 subject to any existing employment agreements
 sets each element
of compensation for the Chief Executive Officer and the other executive officers
 including annual base salary
 annual incentive
bonus and equity compensation. The compensation committee also periodically reviews the terms of employment agreements with the
executive officers
 including in connection with any new hire or the expiration of any existing employment agreements. The compensation
committee will consider the recommendations of the Executive Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer when determining compensation
for the other executive officers. Executive officers do not determine any element or component of their own pay package or total
compensation amount. The Chief Executive Officer has no role in determining and is not present for any discussions regarding his
own compensation.

The
compensation committee also reviews and approves the Company&rsquo;s compensation plans
 policies and programs and administers
the Company&rsquo;s equity incentive plans. In addition
 the Executive Chairman
 the Chief Executive Officer
 the Chief Financial
Officer and other members of management make recommendations to the compensation committee with regard to overall pay strategy
including program designs
 annual incentive design
 and long-term incentive plan design for all employees. Management from time
to time provides the compensation committee with market information and relevant data analysis as requested.


    
    
    
The
compensation committee retains sole authority to engage compensation consultants
 including determining the nature and scope of
services and approving the amount of compensation for those services
 and legal counsel or other advisors. The compensation committee
assesses the independence of any consultants pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing standards of Nasdaq.
The Company will provide for appropriate funding
 as determined by the compensation committee

or studies and the compensation to any consulting firm

Nominating
Committee

The
nominating committee consists of Edward Hanson and Kerry Kennedy
 each of whom is an independent director under the Nasdaq listing
standards. The nominating committee is responsible for overseeing the selection of persons to be nominated to serve on the Board.
The nominating committee will consider persons identified by its members
 management
 stockholders and others.

The
guidelines for selecting nominees
 which are specified in the nominating committee charter
 generally provide that persons to

 education or public service;

 education and experience to make a significant contribution to the Board and bring a range of skills

 a strong sense of professionalism and intense dedication to serving the interests of the stockholders.


The
nominating committee will consider a number of qualifications relating to management and leadership experience
 background and
integrity and professionalism in evaluating a person&rsquo;s candidacy for membership on the Board. The nominating committee may
require certain skills or attributes
 such as financial or accounting experience
 to meet specific Board needs that arise from
time to time. Though the Board does not have specific guidelines on diversity
 it is one of many criteria considered by the Board
when evaluating candidates. The nominating committee does not distinguish among nominees recommended by stockholders and other
persons. The Company does not pay any fee to or otherwise engage any third party or parties to identify or evaluate or assist
in identifying or evaluating potential nominees.

The
nominating committee does not have a written policy or formal procedural requirements for stockholders to submit recommendations
for director nominations. However
 the nominating committee will consider recommendations from stockholders. Stockholders should
communicate nominee suggestions directly to the nominating committee and accompany the recommendation with biographical details
and a statement of support for the nominee. The suggested nominee must also provide a statement of consent to being considered
for nomination. There have been no material changes to the procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our
board of directors.

Compensation
Arrangements

The
Company&rsquo;s compensation policies are intended to provide for compensation that is sufficient to attract
 motivate and retain
executives of outstanding ability and potential and to establish an appropriate relationship between executive compensation and
the creation of stockholder value.

Compensation
Prior to the Business Combination

Paul
N. Vassilakos served as Cullen&rsquo;s sole executive officer during the period from January 1
 2015 to May 27
 2015
 the date
the Business Combination was consummated. Based on Cullen&rsquo;s level of operations
 financial condition and results of operations
Cullen&rsquo;s board of directors
 in consultation with its compensation committee
 determined not to pay any compensation to
Cullen&rsquo;s officers during these periods. Mr. Vassilakos also served as the Company&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer from the
Company&rsquo;s inception through May 27
 2015. The Company did not pay him any compensation for such services.

Philip
Thomas served as LIBB&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer during the period from January 1
 2015 to May 27
 2015
 for which LIBB paid
him $26
000 per year for such services. LIBB also reimbursed him for all out-of-pocket expenses he incurred on LIBB&rsquo;s behalf.

Peter
Dydensborg served as LIBB&rsquo;s Chief Operating Officer during the period from January 1
 2015 to May 27
 2015
 pursuant to
a written employment agreement. Such agreement provided for Mr. Dydensborg to receive a base salary of $170
000 per year. Additionally
Mr. Dydensborg was entitled to an incentive bonus of not less than 15% of his base salary. The employment agreement with Mr. Dydensborg
contained provisions for the protection of LIBB&rsquo;s intellectual property and for non-compete restrictions during employment
and in the event of termination (generally imposing restrictions on (i) employment or consultation with competing companies or
customers
 (ii) recruiting or hiring employees for a competing company and (iii) soliciting or accepting business from LIBB&rsquo;s
customers for a period of one year following termination).

Compensation
after the Business Combination

Upon
consummation of the Business Combination
 Mr. Vassilakos resigned as the Company&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer. Messrs. Thomas
and
 Dydensborg and Meehan became the Company&rsquo;s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and
 Chief Operating
respectively
 and also retained their respective positions with LIBB.

In
connection with the closing of the Business Combination
 Messrs. Thomas and Dydensborg entered into new employment agreements
with the Company to serve as the Company&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer
 respectively. Each employment
agreement has a term of two years from the closing of the Business Combination
 except that the agreement with Mr. Dydensborg
provides that either the Company or the executive can terminate the agreement with six months&rsquo; advance notice. The employment
agreements provide for Messrs. Thomas and Dydensborg to receive base salaries of $150
000 and $130
000
 respectively. Additionally
each is entitled to an incentive bonus of up to 50% and 40% of his base salary
 respectively.


    
    
    
Pursuant
to their employment agreements
 upon the closing of the Business Combination
 Messrs. Thomas and Dydensborg also received a five-year
option to purchase 80
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock and 58
667 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock
 respectively
at an exercise price of $3.75 per share. The options vest quarterly in equal proportions over the two year employment term. If
Mr. Thomas or Dydensborg&rsquo;s employment is terminated by the Company without &ldquo;cause&rdquo; or by such executive with
&ldquo;good reason
&rdquo; then the option granted to him will become vested in full and will be exercisable for one year from
the date of termination. In addition
 the options will be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain non-negotiated change of
control transactions. In the event of certain negotiated change of control transactions
 the compensation committee may
 (i) accelerate
the vesting of the options
 or (ii) require the executive to relinquish the option to the Company upon the tender by the Company
to the executive of cash in an amount equal to the repurchase value of such award.

On
March 10
 2017
 the employment agreement of Mr. Thomas was amended and restated in its entirety to extend the term to December
31
 2019
 and increase the annual compensation to $250
000. In addition
 Mr. Thomas&rsquo; incentive bonuses were changed so
that he is eligible to be paid bonuses from time to time based on the achievement of performance goals for Mr. Thomas and the
Company as established by the compensation committee. The agreement also included a one-time cash payment of $83
000 upon
signing of agreement and an option award with a term of five years to purchase 75
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common
stock
 with an exercise price of $4.50 per share. Of such shares
 25
000 shares are vested on the date of grant and the
remaining 50
000 shares will vest in equal portions on March 10
 2018 and March 10
 2019.

Unless
terminated by the Company without &ldquo;cause&rdquo; or by the executive with &ldquo;good reason&rdquo; (as such terms are defined
in the employment agreements)
 upon termination the executives will be entitled only to their base salary through the date of
termination
 valid expense reimbursements and certain unused vacation pay. If terminated by the Company without &ldquo;cause&rdquo;
or by the executives with &ldquo;good reason
&rdquo; each executive is entitled to be paid severance (base salary for a period
of six months)
 valid expense reimbursements and accrued but unused vacation pay.

Each
of the employment agreements contains provisions for the protection of the Company&rsquo;s intellectual property and confidential
information and certain non-competition restrictions for the executives (generally imposing restrictions during employment and
until May 27
 2017 on (i) ownership or management of
 or employment or consultation with
 competing companies
 (ii) soliciting
employees to terminate their employment (iii) soliciting business from the Company&rsquo;s customers
 and (iv) soliciting prospective
acquisition and investment candidates for purposes of acquiring or investing in such entity).

In
June 2016
 Julian Davidson became the Company&rsquo;s Executive Chairman and Richard Allen became the Company&rsquo;s Chief Financial
Officer.

On
June 6
 2016
 the Company entered into an employment agreement with Richard Allen to serve as the Company&rsquo;s Chief Financial
Officer. The employment agreement has a term of three years
 and automatically renews for additional one year periods thereafter
unless either party provides notice of its decision not to renew. The employment agreements provides for Mr. Allen to receive
a base salary of $170
000. If prior to December 31
 2016
 the Company completes an equity offering with gross proceeds of at least
$5
000
000 or the Company has net sales of at least $1
000
000 during any calendar month
 Mr. Allen&rsquo;s base salary will become
$185
000 commencing on June 6
 2017
 and $200
000 commencing on June 6
 2018. Additionally
 he is entitled to an incentive bonus
of up to 50% of his base salary. Furthermore
 the Company will grant Mr. Allen 8
333 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock
on May 31
 2017 and a number of shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock having a fair market value equal to $50
000 on each
of May 31
 2018 and 2019.


    
    
    
Unless
terminated by the Company without &ldquo;cause&rdquo; or by Mr. Allen with &ldquo;good reason&rdquo; (as such terms are defined
in the employment agreements) or upon death or disability of Mr. Allen
 upon termination Mr. Allen will be entitled only to his
base salary through the date of termination
 valid expense reimbursements and certain unused vacation pay. If terminated upon
death or disability of Mr. Allen
 upon termination Mr. Allen will be entitled to his base salary through the date of termination
valid expense reimbursements and certain unused vacation pay
 and all equity awards will vest to the extent they would have been
vested at the next scheduled vesting date and will remain exercisable for at a certain period of time. If terminated by the Company
without &ldquo;cause&rdquo; or by Mr. Allen with &ldquo;good reason
&rdquo; Mr. Allen is entitled to be paid severance equal to
base salary for nine months
 any previously granted but unpaid bonus
 a pro rata portion of any bonus for the current year
 valid
expense reimbursements and accrued but unused vacation pay
 and all equity awards held by him will vest in full and will remain
exercisable for a certain period of time. If Mr. Allen&rsquo;s agreement is not renewed
 Mr. Allen is entitled to be paid severance
equal to his base salary for five months
 any previously granted but unpaid bonus
 a pro rata portion of any bonus for the current
year
 valid expense reimbursements and accrued but unused vacation pay
 and all equity awards held by him will vest in full and
will remain exercisable for a certain period of time.

The
employment agreement contains provisions for protection of the Company&rsquo;s confidential information and certain non-competition
restrictions for Mr. Allen (generally imposing restrictions during employment and for a period of nine months after the term of
the employment agreement
 on (i) ownership or management of
 or employment or consultation with
 competing companies
 (ii) soliciting
employees to terminate their employment (iii) soliciting business from the Company&rsquo;s customers
 and (iv) soliciting prospective
acquisition and investment candidates for purposes of acquiring or investing in such entity).

On
June 6
 2016
 the Company amended its consulting agreement with Julian Davidson to provide
 among other things
 for him to serve
as the Company&rsquo;s Executive Chairman. Pursuant to the amendment
 the Company agreed (a) to pay to Mr. Davidson $10
000 per
month
 and (b) to grant to Mr. Davidson 1
667 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock per month. Upon the Company&rsquo;s completing
an equity raise with gross proceeds of at least $10
000
000
 the monthly cash fee to Mr. Davidson under the consulting agreement
would increase to $20
000 per month
 the monthly stock grant to Mr. Davidson would be eliminated and Mr. Davidson would receive
a one-time cash bonus of $95
000 and a one-time grant of 50
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock. In addition
 upon
completion of the aforementioned equity raise and Mr. Davidson obtaining a work visa
 Mr. Davidson could enter into an employment
agreement with the Company in the form attached to the consulting agreement or into an amended consulting agreement with substantially
similar terms (either such agreement
 &ldquo;). Mr. Davidson also could enter into a Replacement
Agreement if more than two months had elapsed since the equity raise and he had not obtained a work visa.

The
Company completed an equity raise in July 2016
 but the gross proceeds were less than the $10
000
000 threshold described above.
Effective as of August 18
 2016
 the Company amended the consulting agreement to reduce the $10
000
000 threshold to $6
900
000
(which was less than the gross proceeds of the July 2016 equity raise). As a result of reducing the threshold
 Mr. Davidson&rsquo;s
monthly cash fee increased to $20
000
 his monthly stock grant was eliminated and he received a one-time cash bonus of $95
000
and a one-time grant of 50
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock
 all as described above. Also
 as a result of the threshold
reduction
 Mr. Davidson would have the right to enter into a Replacement Agreement upon obtaining a work visa or upon the elapse
of two months from the closing of the July 2016 equity raise. In addition
 under the amendment
 Mr. Davidson received stock options
to purchase 286
744 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock (in place of a stock option previously provided for in the form
of Replacement Agreement) and certain of the terms of the form of Replacement Agreement were modified.

On
September 29
 2016
 after the expiration of two months from the July 2016 equity raise
 Mr. Davidson elected to enter into a Replacement
Agreement with the Company by amending and restating his consulting agreement. Under the amended and restated consulting agreement
as had been provided in the form of Replacement Agreement
 (a) the Company will pay to Mr. Davidson a fee of $20
833 per month
(b) the Company paid Mr. Davidson an incentive of $75
000 on the date of the agreement and will pay to him $165
000 on the first
anniversary of such date
 (c) the Company granted Mr. Davidson 15
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock on the date of
the agreement
 (d) Mr. Davidson will be eligible to receive an annual additional fee of up to 50% of his annual fee based on Consultant&rsquo;s
performance over each calendar year
 and (e) if the Company completes an additional equity raise with gross proceeds of at least
$3
000
000
 then the Company will issue to Mr. Davidson 20
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock and an option to purchase
a 71
686 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the common stock
as of such date. If Mr. Davidson obtains a work visa
 he has the right to enter into an employment agreement in the form attached
to the amended and restated consulting agreement
 which contains substantially the same compensation terms as the amended and
restated consulting agreement. The form of employment agreement otherwise has similar terms to Mr. Allen&rsquo;s employment agreement.


    
    
    
The
exercise price of the stock options to purchase 286
744 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock issued to Mr. Davidson on August
18
 2016 is $5.50 per share. One-third of such stock options are immediately vested and the remaining two-thirds vest in equal
installments on July 28
 2017 and 2018. The exercise price of the stock options to purchase 71
686 shares of the Company&rsquo;s
common stock that may be issued pursuant to the amended and restated consulting agreement will have an exercise equal to the market
price of the Company&rsquo;s common stock on the date of grant. These stock options will vest on the same schedule as the stock
options issued on August 18
 2016. All the stock options will expire on July 28
 2021. If Mr. Davidson&rsquo;s service to the
Company is terminated by the Company without &ldquo;cause&rdquo; or by him with &ldquo;good reason
&rdquo; then the stock options
granted to him will become vested in full and will be exercisable for one year from the date of termination. In addition
 the
stock options will be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain non-negotiated change of control transactions. In the event of
certain negotiated change of control transactions
 the compensation committee may
 (i) accelerate the vesting of the stock options
or (ii) require the executive to relinquish the stock options to the Company upon the tender by the Company to the executive of
cash in an amount equal to the repurchase value of such award. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 none of the stock options are exercisable
prior to the Company&rsquo;s stockholders approving them. The stock options will be deemed cancelled
 if the Company&rsquo;s stockholders
do not approve them.

Either
Mr. Davidson or the Company may terminate the amended and restated consulting agreement with 30 days&rsquo; prior written notice.
The amended and restated consulting agreement contains certain provisions for protection of the Company&rsquo;s intellectual property
and confidential information and certain non-competition restrictions for Mr. Davidson (generally imposing restrictions during
the term of the consulting agreement
 on (i) ownership or management of
 or employment or consultation with
 competing companies
(ii) soliciting employees to terminate their employment (iii) soliciting business from the Company&rsquo;s customers
 and (iv)
soliciting prospective acquisition and investment candidates for purposes of acquiring or investing in such entity).

In
connection with the Business Combination
 the Company adopted the 2015 Plan
 which is administered by the Company&rsquo;s compensation
committee. The committee may grant stock options
 stock appreciation rights
 restricted stock or other stock-based awards under
the plan to the Company&rsquo;s employees
 officers
 directors and consultants. The Board has reserved 466
667 shares of the Company&rsquo;s
common stock for issuance under the plan. No awards had been granted under the plan as of December 31
 2016. On January 18
 2017
the shareholders approved the amendments to the 2015 Plan (i) to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance from 466
667
to 750
000 shares
 and (ii) to increase the number of shares that may be granted to a single participant in a calendar year from
100
00 to 300
000 shares.

Cullen
Related Party Transactions

The
holders of such Founders&rsquo; Shares became stockholders of Cullen upon consummation of Cullen&rsquo;s business combination
with the predecessor and became stockholders of ours upon consummation of the Business Combination between us
 Cullen and LIBB.
These shares were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-213875)
which was declared effective by the SEC on January 31
 2017.

)
 an
affiliate of Richard Watson
 a former director of Cullen and the brother of Eric Watson
 Cullen&rsquo;s former Chief Executive
Officer and current principal stockholder
 pursuant to which
 on January 31
 2015
 Cullen sold to Hart certain assets and intellectual
property related to Cullen&rsquo;s former agricultural business for an aggregate of $125
000. The assets consisted of all of Cullen&rsquo;s
remaining equipment
 including computer equipment
 agricultural equipment
 vehicles
 a mower
 and a tractor. The intellectual
property consisted of Cullen&rsquo;s proprietary farming system (including forage growth and yields
 animal genetics and milking
systems) that was developed by adapting established grazing science
 processes
 technology
 and genetics to liquid milk production
in the Southeastern United States. Additionally
 in the event that Hart sells the intellectual property subject to the agreement
or licenses the intellectual property to a third party at any time prior to January 31
 2020
 Cullen will be entitled to 20% of
the amount received from such sale or license.

Related
Person Policy

Upon
consummation of the Business Combination
 we adopted a Related Person Policy that requires us (and our subsidiaries
 including
LIBB) to avoid
 wherever possible
 all related party transactions that could result in actual or potential conflicts of interests
except as approved by unconflicted executives
 the board of directors
 or audit committee in accordance with guidelines approved
by the board of directors (or the audit committee). Related-party transactions are defined as transactions in which (1) the aggregate
amount involved will or may be expected to exceed the lesser of $120
000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at
year-end for the last two completed fiscal years
 (2) the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a participant
 and (3) any (a)
executive officer
 director or nominee for election as a director
 (b) greater than 5% beneficial owner of our shares of common
stock
 or (c) immediate family member
 of the persons referred to in clauses (a) and (b)
 has or will have a direct or indirect
material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10% beneficial owner of another entity). A
conflict of interest situation can arise when a person takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his
or her work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise if a person
 or a member of his or her family
 receives
improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position.

Our
audit committee
 pursuant to its written charter
 will be responsible for reviewing and approving related-party transactions to
the extent we enter into such transactions. The audit committee will consider all relevant factors when determining whether to
approve a related party transaction
 including whether the related party transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms
generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related party&rsquo;s
interest in the transaction. No director may participate in the approval of any transaction in which he is a related party
 but
that director is required to provide the audit committee with all material information concerning the transaction. Additionally
we will require each of its directors and executive officers to complete an annual directors&rsquo; and officers&rsquo; questionnaire
that elicits information about related party transactions.

These
procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents
a conflict of interest on the part of a director
 employee or officer.

Independence
of Directors

The
) and the
Company adheres to the Nasdaq listing standards in determining whether a director is independent. The Board consults with its
counsel to ensure that its determinations are consistent with those rules and all relevant securities and other laws and regulations
regarding the independence of directors. Nasdaq requires that a majority of the Board must be composed of &ldquo;independent directors
&rdquo;
which is defined generally as a person other than an officer of a company
 who does not have a relationship with the company that
would interfere with the director&rsquo;s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.
Consistent with these considerations
 the Company has determined that each of Messrs. Hanson
 Roberts and Cardella and Ms. Kennedy
is an independent director.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Long Island Iced Tea Corp. and Subsidiaries

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Long Island Iced Tea Corp. and Subsidiaries (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;)
as of December 31
 2016 and 2015
 and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss
 changes in stockholders&rsquo;
equity and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of
its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting
as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such
opinion. An audit also includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements
 assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion
 the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the consolidated
financial position of Long Island Iced Tea Corp. and Subsidiaries as of December 31
 2016 and 2015
 and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

LONG
ISLAND ICED TEA CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE
1 &ndash; BUSINESS ORGANIZATION
 LIQUIDITY AND MANAGEMENT&rsquo;S PLANS

Business
Organization

Long
Island Iced Tea Corp
 a Delaware C-Corporation (&ldquo;LIIT&rdquo;)
 was formed on December 23
 2014. LIIT was formed in order
to allow for the completion of mergers between Cullen Agricultural Holding Corp. (&ldquo;Cullen&rdquo;) and Long Island Brand
Beverages LLC (&ldquo;LIBB&rdquo;). On December 31
 2014
 LIIT entered into a merger agreement
 as amended as of April 23
 2015
with Cullen
 a public company
 Cullen Merger Sub
 Inc. (&ldquo;Cullen Merger Sub&rdquo;)
 LIBB Acquisition Sub
 LLC (&ldquo;LIBB
Merger Sub&rdquo;)
 Long Island Brand Beverages LLC and the founders of LIBB (&ldquo;Founders&rdquo;). Pursuant to the merger
agreement
 (a) Cullen Merger Sub was to be merged with and into Cullen
 with Cullen surviving and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary
of LIIT and (b) LIBB Merger Sub was to be merged with and into LIBB
 with LIBB surviving and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary
of LIIT (the &ldquo;Mergers&rdquo;). As a result of the merger which was consummated on May 27
 2015
 LIIT consisted of its wholly
owned subsidiaries
 LIBB (its operating subsidiary) and Cullen and Cullen&rsquo;s wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively the
&ldquo;Company&rdquo;).

Under
the merger agreement
 upon consummation of the Company merger on May 27
 2015
 the holders of the LIBB membership interests (the
&ldquo;LIBB members&rdquo;) received 2
633
334 shares of common stock of Holdco (or approximately 63%)

For
accounting purposes
 the Mergers were treated as an acquisition of Cullen by LIBB and as a recapitalization of LIBB
 as the former
LIBB members hold a large percent of the Long Island Iced Tea Corp.&rsquo;s shares and will exercise significant influence over
the operating and financial policies of the consolidated entity and the Company was a public shell company at the time of the
transaction. Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) 805-10-55-11 through 55-15
 the merger or acquisition
of a private operating company into a non-operating public shell with nominal assets is considered a capital transaction in substance
rather than a business combination. As a result
 the consolidated balance sheets
 statements of operations
 and statements of
cash flows of LIBB have been retroactively updated to reflect the recapitalization. Additionally
 the historical consolidated
financial statements of LIBB are now reflected as those of the Company.



The
Company is a holding company operating through its wholly-owned subsidiary
 LIBB. The Company is engaged in the production and
distribution of premium Non-Alcoholic ready-to-drink (&ldquo;NARTD&rdquo;) iced tea in the beverage industry. The Company is currently
organized under its flagship brand
 Long Island Iced Tea
 a premium NARTD tea made from a proprietary recipe and with quality
components. The Company&rsquo;s mission is to provide consumers with premium iced tea offered at an affordable price.

The
Company aspires to be a market leader in the development of iced tea beverages that are convenient and appealing to consumers.
There are two major target markets for Long Island Iced Tea: consumers on the go and health conscious consumers. Consumers on
the go are families
 employees
 students and other consumers who lead a busy lifestyle. With increasingly hectic and demanding
schedules
 there is a need for products that are accessible and readily available. Health conscious consumers are individuals
who are becoming more interested and better educated on what is included in their diets
 causing them to shift away from the less

and the related agreements and instruments thereunder was subsequently transferred to Brentwood LIIT (NZ) Ltd. (the &ldquo;Lender&rdquo;).
Brentwood LIIT Inc. and the Lender are controlled by a related party
 Eric Watson
 who beneficially owned approximately 16% of
the Company on November 23
 2015 and 17.1% as of December 31
 2016. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility
in an initial amount of up to $1

 the Company sold 1
270
156 shares (the &ldquo;Shares&rdquo;) of common stock in a public offering (the &ldquo;Public
Offering&rdquo;) at an offering price of $5.50 per share
 pursuant to the Company&rsquo;s registration statement on Form S-1.
The sale of the Shares generated gross proceeds of $6
985
858 and net proceeds of $5
867
217 after deducting commissions and other
offering expenses. In connection with sale of the Shares
 the Company&rsquo;s common stock was approved for listing on the NASDAQ

 2016. No further sales of
shares were made in the Offering.

In
connection with the sale of the Shares

 the Company entered into a credit line (the &ldquo;UBS Credit Line&rdquo;) with UBS Bank USA (&ldquo;UBS&rdquo;).
The UBS Credit Line has a borrowing capacity of $1
300
000 and bears interest at a floating rate
 depending on the time requested
for the borrowing. The interest is based on the ICE Swap Rate plus a margin of between 0.40% and 0.70%. As of December 31

 Long Island Iced Tea Corp. the Company consummated its underwritten public offering (the &ldquo;December Offering&rdquo;)
of 406
550 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock through Network 1 Financial Securities
 Inc. (&ldquo;Network 1&rdquo;) and
Dawson James Securities
 Inc.
 as underwriters
 pursuant to the terms of the underwriting agreement
 dated December 21
 2016
between the Company and Network 1
 as representative of the underwriters. The Shares were sold for a price to the public of $4.00
per share. The Offering generated gross proceeds of $1
626
200 and net proceeds of $1
423

The
Company believes that as a result of the commitment for financing from certain members of management and a stockholder and its
working capital as of December 31
 2016
 its cash resources will be sufficient to fund the Company&rsquo;s net cash requirements
through March 31
 2018. However
 in order to execute the Company&rsquo;s long-term growth strategy
 the Company may need to raise
additional funds through private equity offerings
 debt financings
 or other means. On March 21
 2017
 the Company received a
commitment letter from certain members of management and a stockholder committing to fund any cash deficit required to sustain
the operations of the Company through March 31
 2018. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to raise such funds
on terms that would be acceptable to the Company.


In
consideration for the commitment for financing from a stockholder
 on March 29
 2017
 the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors
issued to a stockholder a warrant to purchase 165
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock at an exercise price of $4.18
per share. This warrant has a term of one year and is fully vested upon issuance.

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis
of Presentation

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015 have been prepared in accordance
and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&ldquo;US GAAP&rdquo;).



Certain
amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no
effect on the previously reported net loss.

Principles
of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company balances
and transactions have been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

NOTES

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial
statements
 and also affect the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each period. Actual results could differ from those
which result from using such estimates. Management utilizes various other estimates
 including but not limited to
 assessing the
collectability of accounts receivable
 accrual of rebates to customers
 the valuation of securities
 the valuation of inventory
determining the estimated lives of long-lived assets
 determining the potential impairment of intangibles
 the fair value of warrants
issued
 the fair value of stock options
 and other legal claims and contingencies. The results of any changes in accounting estimates
are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which the changes become evident. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed
periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period that they are determined to be necessary.

Revenue
Recognition

Revenue
is stated net of sales discounts and rebates paid to customers (See Customer Marketing Programs and Sales Incentives
 below).
Net sales are recognized when all of the following conditions are met: (1) the price is fixed and determinable; (2) evidence of
a binding arrangement exists (generally
 purchase orders); (3) products have been delivered and there is no future performance
required; and (4) amounts are collectible under normal payment terms. These conditions typically occur when the products are delivered
to or picked up by the Company&rsquo;s customers. For sales where certain revenue recognition criteria have not been met at the
date of delivery
 the Company defers recognition of such revenue and accounts receivable until such recognition criteria are met.

Customer
Marketing Programs and Sales Incentives

The
Company participates in various programs and arrangements with customers designed to increase the sale of its products. Among
these programs are arrangements under which allowances can be earned by customers for various discounts to the end retailers or
for participating in specific marketing programs. The Company believes that its participation in these programs is essential to
ensuring volume and revenue growth in a competitive marketplace. The costs of all these various programs that were included as
a reduction in net sales
 totaled $310
089 and $124
121 for the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015
 respectively. Included
in the total for the year ended December 31
 2016
 was $13
600 related to the issuance of 3
400 shares to customers and the owners
of customers.

Additionally
the Company may be required to occasionally pay fees to its customer (&ldquo;Placement Fees&rdquo;) in order to place its products
in the customers&rsquo; stores. In some cases
 the Placement Fees carry no further benefit or minimum revenue guarantee other
than the right to place the Company&rsquo;s product in the store of the customer. The Placement Fees are recorded as a reduction
of revenue. If
 at the time the Placement Fees are recognized in the statement of operations
 the Company has cumulative negative
revenue with that particular customer
 such negative revenue is reclassified and recorded as a part of selling and marketing expense.
For the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015
 the Company recorded $11
087 and $9
000
 respectively
 of Placement Fees to sales
and marketing expense.

Shipping
and Handling Costs

Shipping
and handling costs incurred to move finished goods from the Company&rsquo;s sales distribution centers to customer locations are
included in selling and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and totaled $420
389 and $126
955
 for
the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015
 respectively.

The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. For the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015
 advertising expense was $151
438
and $246
997
 respectively.

Research
and Development

The
Company expenses the costs of research and development as incurred. For the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015
 research and
development expense related to new product initiatives was $47
067 and $13
333
 respectively. These expenses were incurred pursuant
to a product development agreement which will require the Company to pay $40
000 in cash and $40
000 in common stock upon the
completion of the arrangement. As of December 31
 2016
 $50
000 was included in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet
related to the arrangement
 after the Company&rsquo;s payout of $10
000.

Operating
Leases

The
Company records rent related to its operating leases on a straight line basis over the lease term.



The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents.

Short-term
Investment

The
Company accounts for securities in accordance with accounting standards for investments in debt and equity securities. Accounting
standards require investments in debt and equity securities to be classified as either &ldquo;held to maturity&rdquo;
 &ldquo;trading&rdquo;
or &ldquo;available-for-sale.&rdquo;

The
Company holds investments in marketable securities
 consisting of U.S. government securities and mutual funds. The Company&rsquo;s
available-for-sale securities are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses
 net of taxes
 included
in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in stockholders&rsquo; equity when applicable. During the year ended December
31
 2016
 the unrealized loss was $30
246. Unrealized losses are charged against interest and other income/(expense)
 net
 when
a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary. The Company has not recorded any such impairment charge in the
periods presented. The Company determines realized gains or losses on sale of marketable securities on a specific identification
method
 and record such gains or losses as interest and other income/(expense)
 net.

Pursuant

 the Company was required to utilize $150
000 of the $1
000
000
proceeds from the Credit Agreement for initiatives related to the development of an alcohol business. As of December 31
 2015
$127
580 of the Company&rsquo;s cash on hand was restricted for the use in the development of the alcohol business. During the
year ended December 31
 2015
 the Company spent $22
420 primarily related to product development and costs of attending conferences.
On March 17
 2016
 LIBB entered into an agreement with Brentwood LIIT
 Inc.
 whereby such restriction was lifted.

As
of December 31
 2016
 the Company had cash balances of $103
603 that are pledged against the Company&rsquo;s UBS Credit Line.

Accounts
Receivable

The
Company sells products to distributors and in certain cases directly to retailers
 and extends credit
 generally without requiring
collateral
 based on its evaluation of the customer&rsquo;s financial condition. While the Company has a concentration of credit
risk in the retail sector
 it believes this risk is mitigated due to the diverse nature of the customers it serves
 including
but not limited to
 its type
 geographic location
 size
 and beverage channel. Potential losses on the Company&rsquo;s receivables
are dependent on each individual customer&rsquo;s financial condition and sales adjustments granted after the balance sheet date.
The Company carries its trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. Typically
 accounts receivable have terms of net 30
days and do not bear interest. The Company monitors its exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential
losses or adjustments. The Company determines these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables; (2) analyzing its
history of sales adjustments; and (3) reviewing its high-risk customers. Past due receivable balances are written off when the
Company&rsquo;s efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due. Accounts receivable are stated at the amounts management
expects to collect.

Concentrations
of Credit Risk

Financial
instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash on deposit with
financial institutions
 short-term investments
 and accounts receivable. At times
 the Company&rsquo;s cash in banks is in excess
of the FDIC insurance limit. The Company has not experienced any loss as a result of these cash deposits. These cash balances
are maintained with two banks. As of December 31
 2016
 the Company was exposed to concentrations of credit risk through short-term
investments held with two financial institutions. As of December 31
 2016
 one customer accounted for 46% of the Company&rsquo;s
trade receivables. As of December 31
 2015
 two customers accounted for 14% and 30% of the Company&rsquo;s trade receivables.
The Company does not generally require collateral or other security to support customer receivables. The Company monitors its
exposure for credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated losses
 as required.



The
Company&rsquo;s inventory includes raw materials such as bottles
 sweeteners
 labels
 flavors and packaging. Finished goods inventory
consists of bottled iced tea and ALO Juice. Included in inventory at December 31
 2016 was finished goods inventory with a cost
of approximately $320
000 that was delivered to a distributor
 and is held in inventory until such revenue recognition criteria
are met.

The
Company values its inventories at the lower of cost or market
 net of reserves. Cost is determined using the first-in
 first-out
(FIFO) method. As of December 31
 2016 and 2015
 the Company recorded reserves of $45
078 and $41
790
 respectively
 to reduce
the cost of certain products to estimated net realizable value. The following table summarizes inventories as of the dates presented:

Property
and equipment is recorded at cost. Major property additions
 replacements
 and betterments are capitalized
 while maintenance
and repairs that do not extend the useful lives of an asset or add new functionality are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is
recorded using the straight-line method over the respective estimated useful lives of the Company&rsquo;s assets.

Property
and Equipment
 continued

The
estimated useful lives typically are 3 years for cold-drink containers
 such as reusable fridges
 wood racks
 vending machines
barrels
 and coolers
 and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each group of equipment
as determined using the group-life method. Under this method
 the Company does not recognize gains or losses on the disposal of
individual units of equipment when the disposal occurs in the normal course of business. The Company capitalizes the costs of
refurbishing its cold-drink containers and depreciates those costs over the estimated period until the next scheduled refurbishment
or until the equipment is retired. The estimated useful lives are typically 3 to 5 years for office furniture and equipment and
are depreciated on a straight-line basis. The estimated useful lives for trucks and automobiles are typically 3 to 5 years and
are depreciated on a straight line basis.

Intangible
Assets 

Intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized
 but are tested for impairment annually or when circumstances indicate that
there could be an impairment. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life
continues to be supportable. If not
 the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. As of
December 31
 2016 and 2015
 the Company tested the domain name utilizing the qualitative method. Based on this analysis
 it was
determined that there were no indicators of impairment as of December 31
 2016 and 2015.

assets with indefinite useful lives consist of the cost to purchase an internet domain name for $20
000. The domain name is considered
to have a perpetual life and as such
 is not amortized. Insignificant costs incurred associated with renewing this asset are expensed
as incurred.

Intangible
assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their expected useful life. Intangible assets with useful lives are tested
for impairment when circumstances indicate that there could be an impairment. Intangible assets with finite useful lives include
website development costs of $2
500 and $7
494 as of December 31
 2016 and December 31
 2015
 respectively. The estimated useful
life of the capitalized costs of the Company&rsquo;s website is 3 years and is depreciated on a straight line basis. As of December
31
 2016
 the cost of the website development was $15
000 and the accumulated amortization was $12
500. As of December 31
 2015
the cost of the website development was $15
000 and the accumulated amortization was $7
506. For the years ended December 31
2016 and 2015
 amortization expense was $4
994 and $5
004
 respectively. Expected future amortization of website development costs
is $2
500 for the year ended December 31
 2017.

Deferred
Financing Costs 

The
Company capitalizes issuance costs related to lines of credit as deferred financing costs. The Company amortizes the deferred
financing costs over the term of the line of credit.

Deferred
Offering Costs

The
Company capitalizes the costs related to proposed offerings of its equity instruments as deferred offering costs and records the
deferred offering costs as an offset to additional paid in capital upon the completion of the associated capital raising activity.

Income
Taxes
 continued

The
historical financial statements were those of LIBB. From the date of the Mergers
 the Company&rsquo;s results of operations began
to be taxed as a C corporation. Prior to the Mergers
 the Company&rsquo;s operations were taxed as a limited liability company
whereby the Company elected to be taxed as a partnership and the income or loss was required to be reported by each respective
member on their separate income tax returns. Therefore
 no provision for income taxes has been provided in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements for operating results prior to May 27
 2015.

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740
 &ldquo;Income Taxes&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASC 740&rdquo;). ASC 740
requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes and established for all the entities
a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of tax positions
 and requires certain expanded disclosures.
The provision for income taxes is based upon income or loss after adjustment for those permanent items that are not considered
in the determination of taxable income. Deferred income taxes represent the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting
and tax basis of the Company&rsquo;s assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences
are expected to reverse. The Company evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance
when it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management makes judgments
as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax
liability. In management&rsquo;s opinion
 adequate provisions for income taxes have been made. If actual taxable income by tax
jurisdiction varies from estimates
 additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.

Based
on the Company&rsquo;s evaluation
 it has been concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition
in the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements. The evaluation was performed for the 2016 and 2015 tax years
 which
are the first years for which the Company is subject to corporate income taxes. The Company believes that its income tax positions
and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to its
financial position or results of operations.

The
Company&rsquo;s policy for recording interest and penalties associated with tax audits is to record such items as a component
of income tax expense. There were no amounts accrued for penalties and interest for years ended December 31
 2016 and December
31
 2015. The Company does not expect its uncertain tax position to change during the next twelve months. Management is currently
unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments
 accruals or material deviations from its position.

Stock
Based Compensation

The
Company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with ASC 718
 Compensation - Stock Compensation (&ldquo;ASC 718&rdquo;).
ASC 718 establishes accounting for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services. Under the provisions of ASC 718
 stock
based compensation cost is measured at the grant date
 based on the fair value of the award
 and is recognized as expense over
the employee&rsquo;s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). The fair value of the Company&rsquo;s
common stock options are estimated using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected volatility
dividend rate
 risk free interest rate and the expected life. The Company calculates the expected volatility using the historical
volatility of comparable companies over the most recent period equal to the expected term and evaluates the extent to which available
information indicates that future volatility may differ from historical volatility. The expected dividend rate is zero as the
Company does not expect to pay or declare any cash dividends on common stock. The risk-free rates for the expected terms of the
stock options are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The Company has not experienced significant
exercise activity on stock options. Due to the lack of historical information
 the Company determined the expected term of its
stock option awards issued using the simplified method.

The
simplified method assumes each vesting tranche of the award has a term equal to the midpoint between when the award vests and
when the award expires. The Company expenses stock-based compensation by using the straight-line method.

Earnings
per share

Basic
net earnings per common share is computed by dividing income/loss available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflect
 in periods in which they have a dilutive effect
 the impact
of common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options. The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes those with an
exercise price in excess of the average market price of the Company&rsquo;s common shares during the periods presented. The computation
of diluted earnings per share excludes outstanding options
 warrants and other diluted instruments in periods where the exercise
of such options would be antidilutive. As provided below:

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The
carrying amounts of cash
 short term investments and accounts receivable
 accrued expenses and automobile and equipment loans
and UBS Credit Line approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. In addition
 for notes payable
the Company believes that interest rates approximate prevailing rates.

ASC
820 &ldquo;Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures&rdquo; provides the framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides
a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the
highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and
the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).

Fair
value is defined as an exit price
 representing the amount that would be received upon the sale of an asset or payment to transfer
a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined
based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. A three-tier fair value hierarchy is
used to prioritize the inputs in measuring fair value as follows:

Level
1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level
2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets
 quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities
in markets that are not active
 or other inputs that are observable
 either directly or indirectly.

Level
3 Significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by market data.

In
August 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) issued Accounting Standard Update 2014-15
 &ldquo;Disclosure
of Uncertainties about an Entity&rsquo;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&rdquo; related to disclosure of uncertainties
about an entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. The new standard provides guidance on determining when and how
reporting entities must disclose going concern uncertainties in their financial statements. The new standard requires management
to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date
of issuance of the entity&rsquo;s financial statements. Additionally
 an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is substantial
doubt about the entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years and
interim periods within those fiscal years
 ending after December 15
 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this
standard effective December 31
 2016. The adoption did not have a material effect on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial
statements.

In
January 2016
 the FASB
 issued Accounting Standards Update (&ldquo;ASU&rdquo;) 2016-01
 &ldquo;Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic
825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
&rdquo; which amends the guidance in U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance
primarily affect the accounting for equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
 and the presentation
and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition
 the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance
assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new
standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 and are to be adopted by means of
a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective.
Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair
value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In
February 2016
 the FASB issued new lease accounting guidance (ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases). Under the new guidance
 at the commencement
date
 lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability
 which is a lessee&rsquo;s obligation to make lease payments arising
from a lease
 measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of use asset
 which is an asset that represents the lessee&rsquo;s right
to use
 or control the use of
 a specified asset for the lease term. The new guidance is not applicable for leases with a term
of 12 months or less. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02
for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is
permitted upon issuance. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type
 direct financing
 and operating
leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the beginning of
the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any
transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply
a full retrospective transition approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have
on its consolidated financial statements.

On
March 30
 2016
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&ldquo;ASU&rdquo;) No. 2016-09
 &ldquo;Compensation &ndash; Stock
Compensation (Topic 718)&rdquo;. This update requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies arising from share-based
payment awards should be recognized as income tax expense or benefit on the income statement. The amendment also states that excess
tax benefits should be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity. In addition
 an entity can
make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards expected to vest or account for forfeitures
as they occur. The provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2016. The
Company has determined that implementation of this guidance will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

In
April 2016
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-10 &ldquo;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)&rdquo;
&ldquo;Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASU 2016-10&rdquo;). ASU 2016-10 clarifies the following
two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance
 while retaining the related
principles for those areas. The provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December
15
 2017
 with early application permitted. The Company is continuing to evaluate the expected impact of this new revenue guidance.
The Company currently expects to complete its assessment of the full financial impact of the new revenue recognition guidance
including the method of adoption
 during the next nine months and to adopt the guidance when it becomes effective for the Company
on December 31
 2017.

The
outstanding principal and interest under the credit facility are payable in cash on the maturity date. The Company also paid the
Lender a one-time facility fee equal to 1.75% of the Facility Amount
 which was capitalized and added to the principal amount
of the loan
 and will pay the Lender $30
000 for its expenses at the maturity date. The compounded interest and capitalized fees
are excluded when determining whether the Available Amount has been exceeded. The credit facility is secured by a first priority
security interest in all of the assets of LIIT and LIBB
 including the membership interests in LIBB held by LIIT. LIIT also has
guaranteed the repayment of LIBB&rsquo;s obligations under the credit facility. In addition
 the credit facility will be guaranteed
by Philip Thomas
 the Company&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company
 in certain limited circumstances
up to a maximum amount of $200
000.

The
proceeds of the credit facility may be used for purposes disclosed in writing to the Lender in connection with each advance.

In
connection with the establishment of the credit facility
 the Company issued a warrant to the Lender. The warrant entitled the
holder to purchase 1
111
111 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock at an exercise price of $4.50 and included a cashless
exercise provision. Also
 as part of the Recapitalization
 the warrant was exchanged for 486
111 shares of the Company&rsquo;s
common stock. (See Induced Conversion below for the accounting of the Recapitalization).

The
Lender will have certain &ldquo;piggyback&rdquo; registration rights
 on customary terms
 with respect to the shares of the Company&rsquo;s
common stock issuable upon conversion of the lender note and upon exercise of the Brentwood Warrant. These shares were registered
under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-213875)
 which was declared effected by
the SEC on January 31
 2017.

The
Lender may accelerate the credit facility upon the occurrence of certain events of default
 including a failure to make a payment
under the credit facility when due
 a violation of the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement and related documents
 a filing
of a bankruptcy petition or a similar event with respect to LIBB or the Company or the occurrence of an event of default under
other material indebtedness of LIBB or the Company. The Company and LIBB also made certain customary representations
 warranties
and covenants
 including negative covenants with respect to the incurrence of indebtedness. As of December 31
 2016
 the Company
was in compliance with these covenants.

Deferred
financing costs related to the Credit Agreement
 which are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet
 are amortized
over the three year term of the line of credit agreement. As of December 31
 2016
 the gross carrying amount of deferred financing
costs were $1
903
879 with accumulated amortization of $1
061
347. As of December 31
 2015
 the gross carrying amount of deferred
financing costs were $1
903
879 with accumulated amortization of $65
797.

During
April 2016
 the Company entered into an amendment to the agreement with the Lender
 which provided for the Recapitalization. Upon
a capital raise of at least $5
000
000
 the Lender agreed to convert all of the outstanding principal and interest under the Credit
Facility into 421
972 shares of common stock (assuming all approved advances are completed and there are no further advances by
the Lender) at the closing of the Offering. In addition
 the Lender agreed to exchange its 1
111
111 warrants for 486
111 shares
of common stock at such time. The Credit Facility would remain outstanding except that the Facility Amount would be reduced to
$3
500
000.

In
connection with the reduction in the capacity of the Credit Facility
 the Company recorded a charge of $408
000 to interest expense
to reduce proportionally the unamortized deferred financing costs. Any amounts drawn from the Facility Amount require lender approval.
The Recapitalization was effectuated upon the closing of the Offering.

In
addition
 the Company and LIBB entered into an Amendment No. 1 (the &ldquo;Registration Rights Amendment&rdquo;) to the Registration
Rights Agreement (the &ldquo;Registration Rights Agreement&rdquo;)
 dated as of December 3
 2015
 by and among LIBB
 the Company
and the Lender. The Registration Rights Amendment amended the Registration Rights Agreement
 effective as of the closing of a
Qualified Public Offering
 so that the &ldquo;piggyback&rdquo; registration rights granted to the Lender thereunder will apply
to the shares issuable in the Recapitalization.

Induced
conversion of the credit facility and the related warrants

As
disclosed above
 on July 29
 2016
 as part of the Recapitalization
 the outstanding balance and accrued interest on the credit
facility and the Lender&rsquo;s warrant to purchase 1
111
111 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock was converted into a
total of 908
083 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock. The Company accounted for this transaction as an &ldquo;induced conversion&rdquo;
in accordance with the ASC 470. The transaction qualifies as an inducement as the Company effectively lowered the exercise price
of the warrant in order to induce the holder to convert the debt and warrants to shares of common stock. The Company&rsquo;s purpose
for the inducement was to improve the Company&rsquo;s balance sheet and capitalization ahead of its proposed public offering.

ASC
470 prescribes that
 upon an induced conversion of convertible debt
 the Company should recognize in earnings the difference between
(a) the fair value of the securities issued upon conversion and (b) the fair value of the securities that would have been issued
in accordance with the original conversion terms. The Company determined that during April 2016
 the Company&rsquo;s common stock
had a fair value of $5.50 per share. During April 2016
 the Company determined that its common stock did not have sufficient trading
volume for the market based trading price to be relied upon as a reliable measure of fair value. As such
 the Company needed to
utilize another measure in order to determine fair value. The Company determined that the best measure of fair value was the $5.50
price of shares issued upon the consummation of the Offering
 which closed in July 2016. This fair value was consistent with the
range of pricing established with the Company&rsquo;s bankers ahead of the Offering
 and aligned with the fact that the inducement
transaction would only be effected upon the closing of the Offering.

The
aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying stock options and the fair
value of the Company&rsquo;s common stock.

As
of December 31
 2016
 there was a total of $610
702 of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested options. The cost
is expected to be recognized through 2018 over a weighted average period of 1.19 years.

The
Company accounts for all stock based compensation as an expense in the financial statements and associated costs are measured
at the fair value of the award. For the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015
 the Company recorded stock based compensation
related to stock options of $905
672 and $359
303. In addition
 the Company recorded $30
000 related to the issuance of 7
500
shares of common stock to an employee.

The
Black Scholes option pricing model was used to estimate fair value of options granted as of the date of grant during 2016 using
the following assumptions: a stock price of $5.50
 a dividend yield of 0%
 expected volatility of 75%
 a risk free interest rate
of 1.12%
 and an expected life of 3.0 years. The simplified method was used to determine the expected life as the options were
considered to be plain-vanilla options.

The
Black Scholes option pricing model was used to estimate fair value of options granted as of the date of grant during 2015 using
the following assumptions: a stock price of $8.70
 a dividend yield of 0%
 expected volatility of 79%
 a risk free interest rate
of 0.99%
 and an expected life of 3.25 years. The simplified method was used to determine the expected life as the options were
considered to be plain-vanilla options.

Internal
Revenue Code Section 382 imposes limitations on the use of net operating loss carryovers (&ldquo;NOLs&rdquo;) when the stock ownership
of one or more 5% shareholders (shareholders owning 5% or more of the Company&rsquo;s outstanding capital stock) has increased
on a cumulative basis by more than 50 percentage points.

On
May 27
 2015
 the Mergers represented a more than 50 percentage point change in ownership of Cullen
 with the result that Cullen&rsquo;s
NOLs are subject to a limitation under Section 382. Upon a change of ownership under Section 382
 such losses
 provided that certain
requirements for business continuity are met
 would be subject to an annual limitation based upon the fair value of Cullen multiplied
by the long-term tax exempt bond rate. The Company determined that it did not meet the business continuity requirements
 and as
such
 Cullen&rsquo;s NOLs in the aggregate gross amount of $5
327
000 were not eligible to be carried forward past the date of
the Mergers.

NOTE

In
connection with the Mergers
 the Company recorded gross deferred tax assets of $986
560
 and net deferred tax assets of $0
 after
consideration of a full valuation allowance of $986
560.

Based
on a history of cumulative losses at the Company and the results of operations for the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015
the Company determined that it is more likely than not that it will not realize benefits from the deferred tax assets. The Company
will not record income tax benefits in the consolidated financial statements until it is determined that it is more likely than
not that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred income tax assets. As a result of the analysis
the Company determined that a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets was required. As of December 31
 2016
the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $3
955
042.

As
of December 31
 2016
 the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately
$7
972
573 and $7
972
573
 respectively.

The
Company remains subject to examination by tax authorities for tax years 2013 through 2015. The Company files income tax returns
in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and approximately 23 states.

As
of December 31
 2016
 management does not believe the Company has any material uncertain tax positions that would require it to
measure and reflect the potential lack of sustainability of a position on audit in its financial statements. The Company will
continue to evaluate its uncertain tax positions in future periods to determine if measurement and recognition in its financial
statements is necessary. The Company does not believe there will be any material changes in its unrecognized tax positions over
the next year.

LLC v. Revolution Marketing
 LLC (&ldquo;Revolution&rdquo;) and Ascent Talent
 Model Promotion Ltd. LIBB is seeking damages of
$10

for breach of contract and related causes of action
 claiming damages in the sum of $310

 and seeking punitive damages of
$5
000
000. Ascent has filed a pre-answer motion to dismiss LIBB&rsquo;s complaint. LIBB filed papers in opposition and the motion
was submitted by March 9
 2015. In addition
 Revolution has filed a motion to amend its answer to include cross-claims against
Ascent which were not asserted in its original answer of record. On February 5
 2016
 the Court rendered a decision. The motion
to dismiss was denied with the exception of two claims which the Court dismissed. In the same decision
 the Court granted a separate
motion filed by Revolution to amend its answer to include cross-claims against Ascent. The Company&rsquo;s management and legal
counsel believes it is too early to determine the probable outcome of this matter.

 2015
 the Company&#13;completed the Mergers

 the Company&amp;#8217;s results of operations began to be taxed as a C corporation.&#13;Prior to the Mergers
 the Company&amp;#8217;s operations were taxed as a limited liability company
 whereby the Company elected to&#13;be taxed as a partnership and the income or loss was required to be reported by each respective member on their separate income&#13;tax returns. Therefore
 no provision for income taxes has been provided in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for&#13;operating results prior to May 27

 &amp;#8220;Income Taxes&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;ASC 740&amp;#8221;). ASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach&#13;for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes and established for all the entities a minimum threshold for financial&#13;statement recognition of the benefit of tax positions
 and requires certain expanded disclosures. The provision for income taxes&#13;is based upon income or loss after adjustment for those permanent items that are not considered in the determination of taxable&#13;income. Deferred income taxes represent the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company&#13;evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that&#13;some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax&#13;laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In management&amp;#8217;s opinion
&#13;adequate provisions for income taxes have been made. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates

&#13;it has been concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company&amp;#8217;s consolidated&#13;financial statements. The evaluation was performed for the 2016 and 2015 tax years

 2016 and December 31
 2015. The Company does not expect&#13;its uncertain tax position to change during the next twelve months. Management is currently unaware of any issues under review&#13;that could result in significant payments

 the Financial Accounting&#13;Standards Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) issued Accounting Standard Update 2014-15
 &amp;#8220;Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&amp;#8217;s&#13;Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&amp;#8221; related to disclosure of uncertainties about an entity&amp;#8217;s ability to continue&#13;as a going concern. The new standard provides guidance on determining when and how reporting entities must disclose going concern&#13;uncertainties in their financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of&#13;an entity&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity&amp;#8217;s financial&#13;statements. Additionally
 an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is substantial doubt about the entity&amp;#8217;s ability&#13;to continue as a going concern. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years
&#13;ending after December 15
 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this standard effective December 31

 the FASB
 issued Accounting&#13;Standards Update (&amp;#8220;ASU&amp;#8221;) 2016-01
 &amp;#8220;Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement&#13;of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
&amp;#8221; which amends the guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles&#13;on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting&#13;for equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
 and the presentation and disclosure requirements for&#13;financial instruments. In addition
 the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred&#13;tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years&#13;and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017

 the FASB issued new&#13;lease accounting guidance (ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases). Under the new guidance
 at the commencement date
 lessees will be required&#13;to recognize a lease liability
 which is a lessee&amp;#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
 measured on a&#13;discounted basis; and a right-of use asset
 which is an asset that represents the lessee&amp;#8217;s right to use
 or control the use&#13;of
 a specified asset for the lease term. The new guidance is not applicable for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Lessor&#13;accounting is largely unchanged. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning&#13;after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted upon issuance. Lessees&#13;(for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type
 direct financing
 and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective&#13;transition approach for leases existing at
 or entered into after

 2016
 the FASB issued Accounting&#13;Standards Update (&amp;#8220;ASU&amp;#8221;) No. 2016-09
 &amp;#8220;Compensation &amp;#8211; Stock Compensation (Topic 718)&amp;#8221;. This update&#13;requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies arising from share-based payment awards should be recognized as income&#13;tax expense or benefit on the income statement. The amendment also states that excess tax benefits should be classified along with&#13;other income tax cash flows as an operating activity. In addition
 an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election&#13;to either estimate the number of awards expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur. The provisions of this update&#13;are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15

 the FASB issued Accounting&#13;Standards Update ASU No. 2016-10 &amp;#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)&amp;#8221;
 &amp;#8220;Identifying Performance&#13;Obligations and Licensing&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;ASU 2016-10&amp;#8221;). ASU 2016-10 clarifies the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying&#13;performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance
 while retaining the related principles for those areas. The&#13;provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 with early application&#13;permitted. The Company is continuing to evaluate the expected impact of this new revenue guidance. The Company currently expects&#13;to complete its assessment of the full financial impact of the new revenue recognition guidance
 including the method of adoption
&#13;during the next nine months and to adopt the guidance when it becomes effective for the Company on December 31

 the FASB issued Accounting&#13;Standards Update ASU No. 2016-12 &amp;#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)&amp;#8221;
 &amp;#8220;Narrow-Scope Improvements&#13;and Practical Expedients&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;ASU 2016-12&amp;#8221;). The core principal of ASU 2016-12 is the recognition of revenue to&#13;depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity&#13;expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim&#13;periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 with early application permitted. The Company is continuing to evaluate the expected&#13;impact of this new revenue guidance. The Company currently expects to complete its assessment of the full financial impact of the&#13;new revenue recognition guidance
 including the method of adoption
 during the next nine months and to adopt the guidance when&#13;it becomes effective for the Company on December 31

 the FASB issued Accounting&#13;Standards Update ASU No. 2016-15 &amp;#8220;Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)&amp;#8221;
 &amp;#8220;Classification of Certain Cash Receipts&#13;and Cash Payments&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;ASU 2016-15&amp;#8221;). The amendments for this update provide guidance on the eight specific cash&#13;flows: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs
 settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments
 contingent consideration payments&#13;made after a business combination
 proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims
 proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned&#13;life insurance policies
 distributions received from equity method investees
 beneficial interests in securitization transactions
&#13;and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The provisions of this update are effective&#13;for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2016

 the FASB issued Accounting&#13;Standards Update No. 2017-01
 &amp;#8220;Clarifying the Definition of a Business&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;ASU 2017-01&amp;#8221;)
 which provides&#13;guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets&#13;or businesses. ASU 2017-01 requires entities to use a screen test to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities&#13;is not a business or if the integrated set of assets and activities needs to be further evaluated against the framework. ASU 2017-01&#13;is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017

 upon an induced&#13;conversion of convertible debt
 the Company should recognize in earnings the difference between (a) the fair value of the securities&#13;issued upon conversion and (b) the fair value of the securities that would have been issued in accordance with the original conversion&#13;terms. The Company determined that during April 2016
 the Company&amp;#8217;s common stock had a fair value of $5.50 per share. During&#13;April 2016
 the Company determined that its common stock did not have sufficient trading volume for the market based trading price&#13;to be relied upon as a reliable measure of fair value. As such
 the Company needed to utilize another measure in order to determine&#13;fair value. The Company determined that the best measure of fair value was the $5.50 price of shares issued upon the consummation&#13;of the Offering
 which closed in July 2016. This fair value was consistent with the range of pricing established with the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;bankers ahead of the Offering

 2015
 the Mergers represented&#13;a more than 50 percentage point change in ownership of Cullen
 with the result that Cullen&amp;#8217;s NOLs are subject to a limitation&#13;under Section 382. Upon a change of ownership under Section 382
 such losses
 provided that certain requirements for business continuity&#13;are met
 would be subject to an annual limitation based upon the fair value of Cullen multiplied by the long-term tax exempt bond&#13;rate. The Company determined that it did not meet the business continuity requirements
 and as such
 Cullen&amp;#8217;s NOLs in the&#13;aggregate gross amount of $5
327

 the&#13;Company recorded gross deferred tax assets of $986
560
 and net deferred tax assets of $0
 after consideration of a full valuation&#13;allowance of $986

 2016 and 2015
 the Company determined that it is&#13;more likely than not that it will not realize benefits from the deferred tax assets. The Company will not record income tax benefits&#13;in the consolidated financial statements until it is determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will generate&#13;sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred income tax assets. As a result of the analysis
 the Company determined that a&#13;full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets was required. As of December 31

 Compensation - Stock Compensation (&amp;#8220;ASC 718&amp;#8221;). ASC 718 establishes accounting&#13;for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services. Under the provisions of ASC 718
 stock based compensation cost is measured&#13;at the grant date
 based on the fair value of the award
 and is recognized as expense over the employee&amp;#8217;s requisite service&#13;period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). The fair value of the Company&amp;#8217;s common stock options are estimated&#13;using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected volatility
 dividend rate
 risk free interest&#13;rate and the expected life. The Company calculates the expected volatility using the historical volatility of comparable companies&#13;over the most recent period equal to the expected term and evaluates the extent to which available information indicates that future&#13;volatility may differ from historical volatility. The expected dividend rate is zero as the Company does not expect to pay or declare&#13;any cash dividends on common stock. The risk-free rates for the expected terms of the stock options are based on the U.S. Treasury&#13;yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The Company has not experienced significant exercise activity on stock options.&#13;Due to the lack of historical information

 whereby the Company elected to&#13;be taxed as a partnership and the income or loss was required to be reported by each respective member on their separate income&#13;tax returns. Therefore
 no provision for income taxes has been provided in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for&#13;operating results prior to May 27

 &amp;#8220;Income Taxes&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;ASC 740&amp;#8221;). ASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach&#13;for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes and established for all the entities a minimum threshold for financial&#13;statement recognition of the benefit of tax positions
 and requires certain expanded disclosures. The provision for income taxes&#13;is based upon income or loss after adjustment for those permanent items that are not considered in the determination of taxable&#13;income. Deferred income taxes represent the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company&#13;evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that&#13;some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax&#13;laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In management&amp;#8217;s opinion
&#13;adequate provisions for income taxes have been made. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates

&#13;it has been concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company&amp;#8217;s consolidated&#13;financial statements. The evaluation was performed for the 2016 and 2015 tax years

 2016 and December 31
 2015. The Company does not expect its uncertain&#13;tax position to change during the next twelve months. Management is currently unaware of any issues under review that could result&#13;in significant payments

 Compensation - Stock Compensation (&amp;#8220;ASC 718&amp;#8221;). ASC 718 establishes accounting&#13;for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services. Under the provisions of ASC 718
 stock based compensation cost is measured&#13;at the grant date
 based on the fair value of the award
 and is recognized as expense over the employee&amp;#8217;s requisite service&#13;period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). The fair value of the Company&amp;#8217;s common stock options are estimated&#13;using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected volatility
 dividend rate
 risk free interest&#13;rate and the expected life. The Company calculates the expected volatility using the historical volatility of comparable companies&#13;over the most recent period equal to the expected term and evaluates the extent to which available information indicates that future&#13;volatility may differ from historical volatility. The expected dividend rate is zero as the Company does not expect to pay or declare&#13;any cash dividends on common stock. The risk-free rates for the expected terms of the stock options are based on the U.S. Treasury&#13;yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The Company has not experienced significant exercise activity on stock options.&#13;Due to the lack of historical information

 in periods in which they have a dilutive effect
 the impact of common shares issuable upon&#13;exercise of stock options. The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes those with an exercise price in excess of the&#13;average market price of the Company&amp;#8217;s common shares during the periods presented. The computation of diluted earnings per&#13;share excludes outstanding options

 the Financial Accounting&#13;Standards Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) issued Accounting Standard Update 2014-15
 &amp;#8220;Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&amp;#8217;s&#13;Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&amp;#8221; related to disclosure of uncertainties about an entity&amp;#8217;s ability to continue&#13;as a going concern. The new standard provides guidance on determining when and how reporting entities must disclose going concern&#13;uncertainties in their financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of&#13;an entity&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity&amp;#8217;s financial&#13;statements. Additionally
 an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is substantial doubt about the entity&amp;#8217;s ability&#13;to continue as a going concern. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years
&#13;ending after December 15
 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this standard effective December 31

 &amp;#8220;Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement&#13;of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
&amp;#8221; which amends the guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles&#13;on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting&#13;for equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
 and the presentation and disclosure requirements for&#13;financial instruments. In addition
 the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred&#13;tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years&#13;and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017

 the FASB issued new&#13;lease accounting guidance (ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases). Under the new guidance
 at the commencement date
 lessees will be required&#13;to recognize a lease liability
 which is a lessee&amp;#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
 measured on a&#13;discounted basis; and a right-of use asset
 which is an asset that represents the lessee&amp;#8217;s right to use
 or control the use&#13;of
 a specified asset for the lease term. The new guidance is not applicable for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Lessor&#13;accounting is largely unchanged. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning&#13;after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted upon issuance. Lessees&#13;(for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type
 direct financing
 and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective&#13;transition approach for leases existing at
 or entered into after

 &amp;#8220;Compensation &amp;#8211; Stock Compensation (Topic 718)&amp;#8221;. This update&#13;requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies arising from share-based payment awards should be recognized as income&#13;tax expense or benefit on the income statement. The amendment also states that excess tax benefits should be classified along with&#13;other income tax cash flows as an operating activity. In addition
 an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election&#13;to either estimate the number of awards expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur. The provisions of this update&#13;are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15

 &amp;#8220;Identifying Performance&#13;Obligations and Licensing&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;ASU 2016-10&amp;#8221;). ASU 2016-10 clarifies the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying&#13;performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance
 while retaining the related principles for those areas. The&#13;provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 with early application&#13;permitted. The Company is continuing to evaluate the expected impact of this new revenue guidance. The Company currently expects&#13;to complete its assessment of the full financial impact of the new revenue recognition guidance
 including the method of adoption
&#13;during the next nine months and to adopt the guidance when it becomes effective for the Company on December 31

 &amp;#8220;Narrow-Scope Improvements&#13;and Practical Expedients&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;ASU 2016-12&amp;#8221;). The core principal of ASU 2016-12 is the recognition of revenue to&#13;depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity&#13;expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim&#13;periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 with early application permitted. The Company is continuing to evaluate the expected&#13;impact of this new revenue guidance. The Company currently expects to complete its assessment of the full financial impact of the&#13;new revenue recognition guidance
 including the method of adoption
 during the next nine months and to adopt the guidance when&#13;it becomes effective for the Company on December 31

 &amp;#8220;Classification of Certain Cash Receipts&#13;and Cash Payments&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;ASU 2016-15&amp;#8221;). The amendments for this update provide guidance on the eight specific cash&#13;flows: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs
 settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments
 contingent consideration payments&#13;made after a business combination
 proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims
 proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned&#13;life insurance policies

 which provides&#13;guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets&#13;or businesses. ASU 2017-01 requires entities to use a screen test to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities&#13;is not a business or if the integrated set of assets and activities needs to be further evaluated against the framework.

 a Delaware&#13;C-Corporation (&amp;#8220;LIIT&amp;#8221;)
 was formed on December 23
 2014. LIIT was formed in order to allow for the completion of mergers&#13;between Cullen Agricultural Holding Corp. (&amp;#8220;Cullen&amp;#8221;) and Long Island Brand Beverages LLC (&amp;#8220;LIBB&amp;#8221;). On December&#13;31
 2014
 LIIT entered into a merger agreement
 as amended as of April 23
 2015
 with Cullen
 a public company
 Cullen Merger Sub
&#13;Inc. (&amp;#8220;Cullen Merger Sub&amp;#8221;)
 LIBB Acquisition Sub
 LLC (&amp;#8220;LIBB Merger Sub&amp;#8221;)
 Long Island Brand Beverages&#13;LLC and the founders of LIBB (&amp;#8220;Founders&amp;#8221;). Pursuant to the merger agreement
 (a) Cullen Merger Sub was to be merged&#13;with and into Cullen
 with Cullen surviving and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of LIIT and (b) LIBB Merger Sub was to be merged&#13;with and into LIBB
 with LIBB surviving and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of LIIT (the &amp;#8220;Mergers&amp;#8221;). As a result&#13;of the merger which was consummated on May 27
 2015
 LIIT consisted of its wholly owned subsidiaries

 upon consummation&#13;of the Company merger on May 27
 2015
 the holders of the LIBB membership interests (the &amp;#8220;LIBB members&amp;#8221;) received 2
633

 the Mergers&#13;were treated as an acquisition of Cullen by LIBB and as a recapitalization of LIBB
 as the former LIBB members hold a large percent&#13;of the Long Island Iced Tea Corp.&amp;#8217;s shares and will exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies&#13;of the consolidated entity and the Company was a public shell company at the time of the transaction. Pursuant to Accounting Standards&#13;Codification (&amp;#8220;ASC&amp;#8221;) 805-10-55-11 through 55-15
 the merger or acquisition of a private operating company into a non-operating&#13;public shell with nominal assets is considered a capital transaction in substance rather than a business combination. As a result
&#13;the consolidated balance sheets
 statements of operations
 and statements of cash flows of LIBB have been retroactively updated&#13;to reflect the recapitalization. Additionally

Business Organization
 Liquidity and Management's Plans
NOTE 1 &#8211; BUSINESS ORGANIZATION
LIQUIDITY AND MANAGEMENT&#8217;S PLANS




 a Delaware
C-Corporation (&#8220;LIIT&#8221;)
 was formed on December 23
 2014. LIIT was formed in order to allow for the completion of mergers
between Cullen Agricultural Holding Corp. (&#8220;Cullen&#8221;) and Long Island Brand Beverages LLC (&#8220;LIBB&#8221;). On December
31
 2014
 LIIT entered into a merger agreement
 as amended as of April 23
 2015
 with Cullen
 a public company
 Cullen Merger Sub
Inc. (&#8220;Cullen Merger Sub&#8221;)
 LIBB Acquisition Sub
 LLC (&#8220;LIBB Merger Sub&#8221;)
 Long Island Brand Beverages
LLC and the founders of LIBB (&#8220;Founders&#8221;). Pursuant to the merger agreement
 (a) Cullen Merger Sub was to be merged
with and into Cullen
 with Cullen surviving and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of LIIT and (b) LIBB Merger Sub was to be merged
with and into LIBB
 with LIBB surviving and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of LIIT (the &#8220;Mergers&#8221;). As a result
of the merger which was consummated on May 27
 2015
 LIIT consisted of its wholly owned subsidiaries
 LIBB (its operating subsidiary)
and Cullen and Cullen&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively the &#8220;Company&#8221;).


 upon consummation
of the Company merger on May 27
 2015
 the holders of the LIBB membership interests (the &#8220;LIBB members&#8221;) received 2
633
334
shares of common stock of Holdco (or approximately 63%)


 the Mergers
were treated as an acquisition of Cullen by LIBB and as a recapitalization of LIBB
 as the former LIBB members hold a large percent
of the Long Island Iced Tea Corp.&#8217;s shares and will exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies
of the consolidated entity and the Company was a public shell company at the time of the transaction. Pursuant to Accounting Standards
Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 805-10-55-11 through 55-15
 the merger or acquisition of a private operating company into a non-operating
public shell with nominal assets is considered a capital transaction in substance rather than a business combination. As a result
the consolidated balance sheets
 statements of operations
 and statements of cash flows of LIBB have been retroactively updated
to reflect the recapitalization. Additionally
 the historical consolidated financial statements of LIBB are now reflected as those
of the Company.

in the development of iced tea beverages that are convenient and appealing to consumers. There are two major target markets for
Long Island Iced Tea: consumers on the go and health conscious consumers. Consumers on the go are families
 employees
 students
and other consumers who lead a busy lifestyle. With increasingly hectic and demanding schedules
 there is a need for products that
are accessible and readily available. Health conscious consumers are individuals who are becoming more interested and better educated
on what is included in their diets
 causing them to shift away from the less healthy options
 such as carbonated soft drinks
 towards
alternative energy beverages such as iced tea.

 Rhode Island and parts of the Midwest. As of December 31
 2016
 the Company&#8217;s products
are available in 27 states. The Company has also begun to sell its products globally in regions such as South Korea and in multiple
Caribbean nations.




 2016
 the Company entered
into an asset purchase agreement with The Wilnah International
 LLC (&#8220;Wilnah&#8221;). Pursuant to the agreement
 the Company
will acquire the intellectual property (&#8220;IP&#8221;) (trade names
 formulas
 recipes) for ALO Juice. Upon the closing
 the
Company will issue to Wilnah 5
000 shares of its common stock. The closing of the transaction is expected to occur in early Spring
2017. Separately

 by and among LIBB
 as the borrower
 LIIT and
Brentwood LIIT Inc.

 the Company received a commitment letter from certain members
of management and a stockholder committing to fund any cash deficit required to sustain the operations of the Company through March
31
 2018. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to raise such funds on terms that would be acceptable to the Company.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

 2016 and 2015 have been prepared in accordance and in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;US GAAP&#8221;).

net loss.




include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.




in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements
 and also affect
the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each period. Actual results could differ from those which result from using such
estimates. Management utilizes various other estimates
 including but not limited to
 assessing the collectability of accounts
receivable
 accrual of rebates to customers
 the valuation of securities
 the valuation of inventory
 determining the estimated
lives of long-lived assets
 determining the potential impairment of intangibles
 the fair value of warrants issued
 the fair value
of stock options
 and other legal claims and contingencies. The results of any changes in accounting estimates
 are reflected in
the financial statements in the period in which the changes become evident. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically
and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period that they are determined to be necessary.




and rebates paid to customers (See Customer Marketing Programs and Sales Incentives
 below). Net sales are recognized when all
of the following conditions are met: (1) the price is fixed and determinable; (2) evidence of a binding arrangement exists (generally
purchase orders); (3) products have been delivered and there is no future performance required; and (4) amounts are collectible
under normal payment terms. These conditions typically occur when the products are delivered to or picked up by the Company&#8217;s
customers. For sales where certain revenue recognition criteria have not been met at the date of delivery
 the Company defers recognition
of such revenue and accounts receivable until such recognition criteria are met.

Customer Marketing Programs and Sales
Incentives


programs and arrangements with customers designed to increase the sale of its products. Among these programs are arrangements under
which allowances can be earned by customers for various discounts to the end retailers or for participating in specific marketing
programs. The Company believes that its participation in these programs is essential to ensuring volume and revenue growth in a
competitive marketplace. The costs of all these various programs that were included as a reduction in net sales
 totaled $310
089
and $124
121 for the years ended December 31
 2016 and 2015
 respectively. Included in the total for the year ended December 31
2016
 was $13
600 related to the issuance of 3
400 shares to customers and the owners of customers.


 the Company may be required
to occasionally pay fees to its customer (&#8220;Placement Fees&#8221;) in order to place its products in the customers&#8217;
stores. In some cases
 the Placement Fees carry no further benefit or minimum revenue guarantee other than the right to place the
Company&#8217;s product in the store of the customer. The Placement Fees are recorded as a reduction of revenue. If
 at the time
the Placement Fees are recognized in the statement of operations
 the Company has cumulative negative revenue with that particular
customer
 such negative revenue is reclassified and recorded as a part of selling and marketing expense. For the years ended December
31
 2016 and 2015
 the Company recorded $11
087 and $9
000
 respectively
 of Placement Fees to sales and marketing expense.

Agreement with Brentwood LIIT Inc.
 the Company was required to utilize $150
000 of the $1
000
000 proceeds from the Credit Agreement
for initiatives related to the development of an alcohol business. As of December 31
 2015
 $127
580 of the Company&#8217;s cash
on hand was restricted for the use in the development of the alcohol business. During the year ended December 31
 2015
 the Company

 2016
 LIBB entered into
an agreement with Brentwood LIIT

 generally without requiring collateral
 based on its evaluation
of the customer&#8217;s financial condition. While the Company has a concentration of credit risk in the retail sector
 it believes
this risk is mitigated due to the diverse nature of the customers it serves

 its type

location
 size
 and beverage channel. Potential losses on the Company&#8217;s receivables are dependent on each individual customer&#8217;s
financial condition and sales adjustments granted after the balance sheet date. The Company carries its trade accounts receivable
at net realizable value. Typically
 accounts receivable have terms of net 30 days and do not bear interest. The Company monitors
its exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential losses or adjustments. The Company determines these
allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables; (2) analyzing its history of sales adjustments; and (3) reviewing its
high-risk customers. Past due receivable balances are written off when the Company&#8217;s efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting
the amount due. Accounts receivable are stated at the amounts management expects to collect.

 the Company&#8217;s cash in banks is in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. The
Company has not experienced any loss as a result of these cash deposits. These cash balances are maintained with two banks. As
of December 31
 2016
 the Company was exposed to concentrations of credit risk through short-term investments held with two financial
institutions. As of December 31
 2016
 one customer accounted for 46% of the Company&#8217;s trade receivables. As of December
31
 2015
 two customers accounted for 14% and 30% of the Company&#8217;s trade receivables. The Company does not generally require
collateral or other security to support customer receivables. The Company monitors its exposure for credit losses and maintains
allowances for anticipated losses
 as required.

using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each group of equipment
 as determined using the group-life method.
Under this method
 the Company does not recognize gains or losses on the disposal of individual units of equipment when the disposal
occurs in the normal course of business. The Company capitalizes the costs of refurbishing its cold-drink containers and depreciates
those costs over the estimated period until the next scheduled refurbishment or until the equipment is retired. The estimated useful
lives are typically 3 to 5 years for office furniture and equipment and are depreciated on a straight-line basis. The estimated
useful lives for trucks and automobiles are typically 3 to 5 years and are depreciated on a straight line basis.




lives are not amortized
 but are tested for impairment annually or when circumstances indicate that there could be an impairment.
The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If
not
 the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. As of December 31
 2016 and 2015
 the
Company tested the domain name utilizing the qualitative method. Based on this analysis
 it was determined that there were no indicators
of impairment as of December 31
 2016 and 2015.


lives consist of the cost to purchase an internet domain name for $20
000. The domain name is considered to have a perpetual life
and as such
 is not amortized. Insignificant costs incurred associated with renewing this asset are expensed as incurred.


lives are amortized over their expected useful life. Intangible assets with useful lives are tested for impairment when circumstances
indicate that there could be an impairment. Intangible assets with finite useful lives include website development costs of $2

 2016 and December 31
 2015
 respectively. The estimated useful life of the capitalized costs of the
Company&#8217;s website is 3 years and is depreciated on a straight line basis. As of December 31
 2016
 the cost of the website

were those of LIBB. From the date of the Mergers
 the Company&#8217;s results of operations began to be taxed as a C corporation.
Prior to the Mergers
 the Company&#8217;s operations were taxed as a limited liability company
 whereby the Company elected to
be taxed as a partnership and the income or loss was required to be reported by each respective member on their separate income
tax returns. Therefore
 no provision for income taxes has been provided in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for
operating results prior to May 27
 2015.


in accordance with FASB ASC 740
 &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; (&#8220;ASC 740&#8221;). ASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach
for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes and established for all the entities a minimum threshold for financial
statement recognition of the benefit of tax positions
 and requires certain expanded disclosures. The provision for income taxes
is based upon income or loss after adjustment for those permanent items that are not considered in the determination of taxable
income. Deferred income taxes represent the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company&#8217;s
assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company
evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that
some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax
laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In management&#8217;s opinion
adequate provisions for income taxes have been made. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates
 additional
allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.


it has been concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company&#8217;s consolidated
financial statements. The evaluation was performed for the 2016 and 2015 tax years
 which are the first years for which the Company
is subject to corporate income taxes. The Company believes that its income tax positions and deductions will be sustained on audit
and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to its financial position or results of operations.


interest and penalties associated with tax audits is to record such items as a component of income tax expense. There were no amounts
accrued for penalties and interest for years ended December 31
 2016 and December 31
 2015. The Company does not expect its uncertain
tax position to change during the next twelve months. Management is currently unaware of any issues under review that could result
in significant payments
 accruals or material deviations from its position.




compensation in accordance with ASC 718
 Compensation - Stock Compensation (&#8220;ASC 718&#8221;). ASC 718 establishes accounting
for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services. Under the provisions of ASC 718
 stock based compensation cost is measured
at the grant date
 based on the fair value of the award
 and is recognized as expense over the employee&#8217;s requisite service
period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). The fair value of the Company&#8217;s common stock options are estimated
using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected volatility
 dividend rate
 risk free interest
rate and the expected life. The Company calculates the expected volatility using the historical volatility of comparable companies
over the most recent period equal to the expected term and evaluates the extent to which available information indicates that future
volatility may differ from historical volatility. The expected dividend rate is zero as the Company does not expect to pay or declare
any cash dividends on common stock. The risk-free rates for the expected terms of the stock options are based on the U.S. Treasury
yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The Company has not experienced significant exercise activity on stock options.
Due to the lack of historical information
 the Company determined the expected term of its stock option awards issued using the
simplified method.


tranche of the award has a term equal to the midpoint between when the award vests and when the award expires. The Company expenses

is computed by dividing income/loss available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share reflect
 in periods in which they have a dilutive effect
 the impact of common shares issuable upon
exercise of stock options. The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes those with an exercise price in excess of the
average market price of the Company&#8217;s common shares during the periods presented. The computation of diluted earnings per

Recent Accounting Pronouncements



 the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standard Update 2014-15
 &#8220;Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&#8217;s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&#8221; related to disclosure of uncertainties about an entity&#8217;s ability to continue
as a going concern. The new standard provides guidance on determining when and how reporting entities must disclose going concern
uncertainties in their financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of
an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity&#8217;s financial
statements. Additionally
 an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is substantial doubt about the entity&#8217;s ability
to continue as a going concern. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years
ending after December 15
 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this standard effective December 31
 2016. The
adoption did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.


 the FASB
 issued Accounting
Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2016-01
 &#8220;Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
&#8221; which amends the guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting
for equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
 and the presentation and disclosure requirements for
financial instruments. In addition
 the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred
tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years
and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 and are to be adopted by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the
balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted
except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific
credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have
on its consolidated financial statements.


 the FASB issued new
lease accounting guidance (ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases). Under the new guidance
 at the commencement date
 lessees will be required
to recognize a lease liability
 which is a lessee&#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
 measured on a
discounted basis; and a right-of use asset
 which is an asset that represents the lessee&#8217;s right to use
 or control the use
of
 a specified asset for the lease term. The new guidance is not applicable for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Lessor
accounting is largely unchanged. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning
after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted upon issuance. Lessees
(for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type
 direct financing
 and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective
transition approach for leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in
the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired
before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.


 2016
 the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2016-09
 &#8220;Compensation &#8211; Stock Compensation (Topic 718)&#8221;. This update
requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies arising from share-based payment awards should be recognized as income
tax expense or benefit on the income statement. The amendment also states that excess tax benefits should be classified along with
other income tax cash flows as an operating activity. In addition
 an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election
to either estimate the number of awards expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur. The provisions of this update
are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2016. The Company has determined that implementation
of this guidance will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.


 the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update ASU No. 2016-10 &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)&#8221;
 &#8220;Identifying Performance
Obligations and Licensing&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2016-10&#8221;). ASU 2016-10 clarifies the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying
performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance
 while retaining the related principles for those areas. The
provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 with early application
permitted. The Company is continuing to evaluate the expected impact of this new revenue guidance. The Company currently expects
to complete its assessment of the full financial impact of the new revenue recognition guidance
 including the method of adoption
during the next nine months and to adopt the guidance when it becomes effective for the Company on December 31
 2017.


 the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update ASU No. 2016-12 &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)&#8221;
 &#8220;Narrow-Scope Improvements
and Practical Expedients&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2016-12&#8221;). The core principal of ASU 2016-12 is the recognition of revenue to
depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim
periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 with early application permitted. The Company is continuing to evaluate the expected
impact of this new revenue guidance. The Company currently expects to complete its assessment of the full financial impact of the
new revenue recognition guidance
 including the method of adoption
 during the next nine months and to adopt the guidance when
it becomes effective for the Company on December 31
 2017.


 the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update ASU No. 2016-15 &#8220;Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)&#8221;
 &#8220;Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2016-15&#8221;). The amendments for this update provide guidance on the eight specific cash
flows: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs
 settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments
 contingent consideration payments
made after a business combination
 proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims
 proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned
life insurance policies
 distributions received from equity method investees
 beneficial interests in securitization transactions
and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The provisions of this update are effective
for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 with early application permitted. The Company has determined
that implementation of this guidance will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.


 the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2017-01
 &#8220;Clarifying the Definition of a Business&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2017-01&#8221;)
 which provides
guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets
or businesses. ASU 2017-01 requires entities to use a screen test to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities
is not a business or if the integrated set of assets and activities needs to be further evaluated against the framework. ASU 2017-01
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017
 including interim periods within those years. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.

the Lender agreed to convert all of the outstanding principal and interest under the Credit Facility into 421
972 shares of common

In addition
 the Lender agreed to exchange its 1

 the Company recorded a charge of $408
000 to interest expense to reduce proportionally the
unamortized deferred financing costs. Any amounts drawn from the Facility Amount require lender approval. The Recapitalization
was effectuated upon the closing of the Offering.


 the Company and LIBB entered
into an Amendment No. 1 (the &#8220;Registration Rights Amendment&#8221;) to the Registration Rights Agreement (the &#8220;Registration
Rights Agreement&#8221;)
 dated as of December 3
 2015
 by and among LIBB

Amendment amended the Registration Rights Agreement

registration rights granted to the Lender thereunder will apply to the shares issuable in the Recapitalization.

Induced conversion of the credit
facility and the related warrants


 on July 29
 2016
as part of the Recapitalization
 the outstanding balance and accrued interest on the credit facility and the Lender&#8217;s warrant
to purchase 1
111
111 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock was converted into a total of 908
083 shares of the Company&#8217;s
common stock. The Company accounted for this transaction as an &#8220;induced conversion&#8221; in accordance with the ASC 470.
The transaction qualifies as an inducement as the Company effectively lowered the exercise price of the warrant in order to induce
the holder to convert the debt and warrants to shares of common stock. The Company&#8217;s purpose for the inducement was to improve
the Company&#8217;s balance sheet and capitalization ahead of its proposed public offering.


 upon an induced
conversion of convertible debt
 the Company should recognize in earnings the difference between (a) the fair value of the securities
issued upon conversion and (b) the fair value of the securities that would have been issued in accordance with the original conversion
terms. The Company determined that during April 2016
 the Company&#8217;s common stock had a fair value of $5.50 per share. During
April 2016
 the Company determined that its common stock did not have sufficient trading volume for the market based trading price
to be relied upon as a reliable measure of fair value. As such
 the Company needed to utilize another measure in order to determine
fair value. The Company determined that the best measure of fair value was the $5.50 price of shares issued upon the consummation
of the Offering
 which closed in July 2016. This fair value was consistent with the range of pricing established with the Company&#8217;s
bankers ahead of the Offering
 and aligned with the fact that the inducement transaction would only be effected upon the closing
of the Offering.


 2016
the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $1
587
954 related to the &#8220;induced conversion&#8221;
 which is recorded on the
Statements of Operations as loss on induced conversion of line of credit and warrants. The induced conversion charge was measured
as of April 2016
 the date the agreement was reached
 and recorded on July 29
 2016
 the date the conversion was consummated. The
charge was calculated as follows:

50 percentage points.


 2015
 the Mergers represented
a more than 50 percentage point change in ownership of Cullen
 with the result that Cullen&#8217;s NOLs are subject to a limitation

 would be subject to an annual limitation based upon the fair value of Cullen multiplied by the long-term tax exempt bond
rate. The Company determined that it did not meet the business continuity requirements

 Cullen&#8217;s NOLs in the
aggregate gross amount of $5

in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements
 and also affect
the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each period. Actual results could differ from those which result from using
such estimates. Management utilizes various other estimates

 the valuation of securities
 the valuation of inventory

lives of long-lived assets
 determining the potential impairment of intangibles

of the following conditions are met: (1) the price is fixed and determinable; (2) evidence of a binding arrangement exists (generally
purchase orders); (3) products have been delivered and there is no future performance required; and (4) amounts are collectible
under normal payment terms. These conditions typically occur when the products are delivered to or picked up by the Company&#8217;s

 it believes
this risk is mitigated due to the diverse nature of the customers it serves

 but not limited to
 its type

location
 size
 and beverage channel. Potential losses on the Company&#8217;s receivables are dependent on each individual customer&#8217;s
financial condition and sales adjustments granted after the balance sheet date. The Company carries its trade accounts receivable
at net realizable value. Typically
 accounts receivable have terms of net 30 days and do not bear interest. The Company monitors
its exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential losses or adjustments. The Company determines these
allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables; (2) analyzing its history of sales adjustments; and (3) reviewing its
high-risk customers. Past due receivable balances are written off when the Company&#8217;s efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting
the amount due. Accounts receivable are stated at the amounts management expects to collect.

using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each group of equipment
 as determined using the group-life method.
Under this method
 the Company does not recognize gains or losses on the disposal of individual units of equipment when the disposal
occurs in the normal course of business. The Company capitalizes the costs of refurbishing its cold-drink containers and depreciates
those costs over the estimated period until the next scheduled refurbishment or until the equipment is retired. The estimated
useful lives are typically 3 to 5 years for office furniture and equipment and are depreciated on a straight-line basis. The estimated
useful lives for trucks and automobiles are typically 3 to 5 years and are depreciated on a straight line basis.









lives are not amortized
 but are tested for impairment annually or when circumstances indicate that there could be an impairment.
The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If
not
 the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. As of December 31
 2016 and 2015
 the
Company tested the domain name utilizing the qualitative method. Based on this analysis
 it was determined that there were no indicators
of impairment as of December 31
 2016 and 2015.


lives consist of the cost to purchase an internet domain name for $20
000. The domain name is considered to have a perpetual life
and as such
 is not amortized. Insignificant costs incurred associated with renewing this asset are expensed as incurred.


lives are amortized over their expected useful life. Intangible assets with useful lives are tested for impairment when circumstances
indicate that there could be an impairment. Intangible assets with finite useful lives include website development costs of $2

 2016 and December 31
 2015
 respectively. The estimated useful life of the capitalized costs of
the Company&#8217;s website is 3 years and is depreciated on a straight line basis. As of December 31
 2016
 the cost of the website
development was $15

 whereby LIBB was deemed to be the accounting acquirer of Cullen.


were those of LIBB. From the date of the Mergers
 the Company&#8217;s results of operations began to be taxed as a C corporation.
Prior to the Mergers
 the Company&#8217;s operations were taxed as a limited liability company
 whereby the Company elected to
be taxed as a partnership and the income or loss was required to be reported by each respective member on their separate income
tax returns. Therefore
 no provision for income taxes has been provided in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for
operating results prior to May 27
 2015.


in accordance with FASB ASC 740
 &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; (&#8220;ASC 740&#8221;). ASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach
for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes and established for all the entities a minimum threshold for financial
statement recognition of the benefit of tax positions
 and requires certain expanded disclosures. The provision for income taxes
is based upon income or loss after adjustment for those permanent items that are not considered in the determination of taxable
income. Deferred income taxes represent the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company&#8217;s
assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company
evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that
some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax
laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In management&#8217;s opinion
adequate provisions for income taxes have been made. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates
 additional
allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.


it has been concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company&#8217;s consolidated
financial statements. The evaluation was performed for the 2016 and 2015 tax years
 which are the first years for which the Company
is subject to corporate income taxes. The Company believes that its income tax positions and deductions will be sustained on audit
and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to its financial position or results of operations.


interest and penalties associated with tax audits is to record such items as a component of income tax expense. There were no
amounts accrued for penalties and interest for years ended December 31
 2016 and December 31
 2015. The Company does not expect
its uncertain tax position to change during the next twelve months. Management is currently unaware of any issues under review
that could result in significant payments
 accruals or material deviations from its position.









compensation in accordance with ASC 718
 Compensation - Stock Compensation (&#8220;ASC 718&#8221;). ASC 718 establishes accounting
for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services. Under the provisions of ASC 718
 stock based compensation cost is measured
at the grant date
 based on the fair value of the award
 and is recognized as expense over the employee&#8217;s requisite service
period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). The fair value of the Company&#8217;s common stock options are estimated
using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected volatility
 dividend rate
 risk free interest
rate and the expected life. The Company calculates the expected volatility using the historical volatility of comparable companies
over the most recent period equal to the expected term and evaluates the extent to which available information indicates that future
volatility may differ from historical volatility. The expected dividend rate is zero as the Company does not expect to pay or declare
any cash dividends on common stock. The risk-free rates for the expected terms of the stock options are based on the U.S. Treasury
yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The Company has not experienced significant exercise activity on stock options.
Due to the lack of historical information
 the Company determined the expected term of its stock option awards issued using the
simplified method.


vesting tranche of the award has a term equal to the midpoint between when the award vests and when the award expires. The Company
expenses stock-based compensation by using the straight-line method.








is computed by dividing income/loss available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share reflect
 in periods in which they have a dilutive effect
 the impact of common shares issuable upon
exercise of stock options. The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes those with an exercise price in excess of the
average market price of the Company&#8217;s common shares during the periods presented. The computation of diluted earnings per
share excludes outstanding options
 warrants and other diluted instruments in periods where the exercise of such options would
be antidilutive. As provided below:

Recent Accounting Pronouncements



 the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standard Update 2014-15
 &#8220;Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&#8217;s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&#8221; related to disclosure of uncertainties about an entity&#8217;s ability to continue
as a going concern. The new standard provides guidance on determining when and how reporting entities must disclose going concern
uncertainties in their financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of
an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity&#8217;s financial
statements. Additionally
 an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is substantial doubt about the entity&#8217;s ability
to continue as a going concern. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years
ending after December 15
 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this standard effective December 31
 2016. The
adoption did not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.


 the FASB
 issued Accounting
Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2016-01
 &#8220;Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
&#8221; which amends the guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting
for equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
 and the presentation and disclosure requirements for
financial instruments. In addition
 the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred
tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years
and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 and are to be adopted by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the
balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted
except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific
credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have
on its consolidated financial statements.


 the FASB issued new
lease accounting guidance (ASU No. 2016-02
 Leases). Under the new guidance
 at the commencement date
 lessees will be required
to recognize a lease liability
 which is a lessee&#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
 measured on a
discounted basis; and a right-of use asset
 which is an asset that represents the lessee&#8217;s right to use
 or control the use
of
 a specified asset for the lease term. The new guidance is not applicable for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Lessor
accounting is largely unchanged. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning
after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted upon issuance. Lessees
(for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type
 direct financing
 and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective
transition approach for leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in
the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired
before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.


 2016
 the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2016-09
 &#8220;Compensation &#8211; Stock Compensation (Topic 718)&#8221;. This update
requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies arising from share-based payment awards should be recognized as income
tax expense or benefit on the income statement. The amendment also states that excess tax benefits should be classified along with
other income tax cash flows as an operating activity. In addition
 an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election
to either estimate the number of awards expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur. The provisions of this update
are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2016. The Company has determined that implementation
of this guidance will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.


 the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update ASU No. 2016-10 &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)&#8221;
 &#8220;Identifying Performance
Obligations and Licensing&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2016-10&#8221;). ASU 2016-10 clarifies the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying
performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance
 while retaining the related principles for those areas. The
provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 with early application
permitted. The Company is continuing to evaluate the expected impact of this new revenue guidance. The Company currently expects
to complete its assessment of the full financial impact of the new revenue recognition guidance
 including the method of adoption
during the next nine months and to adopt the guidance when it becomes effective for the Company on December 31
 2017.


 the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update ASU No. 2016-12 &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)&#8221;
 &#8220;Narrow-Scope Improvements
and Practical Expedients&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2016-12&#8221;). The core principal of ASU 2016-12 is the recognition of revenue to
depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim
periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 with early application permitted. The Company is continuing to evaluate the expected
impact of this new revenue guidance. The Company currently expects to complete its assessment of the full financial impact of the
new revenue recognition guidance
 including the method of adoption
 during the next nine months and to adopt the guidance when
it becomes effective for the Company on December 31
 2017.


 the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update ASU No. 2016-15 &#8220;Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)&#8221;
 &#8220;Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2016-15&#8221;). The amendments for this update provide guidance on the eight specific cash
flows: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs
 settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments
 contingent consideration payments
made after a business combination
 proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims
 proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned
life insurance policies
 distributions received from equity method investees
 beneficial interests in securitization transactions
and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The provisions of this update are effective
for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 with early application permitted. The Company has determined
that implementation of this guidance will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.


 the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2017-01
 &#8220;Clarifying the Definition of a Business&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2017-01&#8221;)
 which provides
guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets
or businesses. ASU 2017-01 requires entities to use a screen test to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities
is not a business or if the integrated set of assets and activities needs to be further evaluated against the framework. ASU 2017-01
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017
 including interim periods within those years. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.

The estimated measure of the percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean.
