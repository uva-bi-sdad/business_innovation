 Inc. (the Company or Pacific Ventures) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 3
 1986
 under the name AOA Corporation. On November 12
 1991
 the Company changed its name to American Eagle Group
 Inc. On October 22
 2012
 the Company changed its name to Pacific Ventures Group




 Inc. (Sn&#246;bar) through a share exchange. The reverse merger entered on August 14
 2015
 by Pacific Ventures Group
 Inc. and its stockholders through a share exchange agreement with Sn&#246;bar Holdings
 Inc. (Sn&#246;bar Holdings)
 pursuant to which Pacific Ventures acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Sn&#246;bar Holdings' Class A and Class B common stock in exchange for 22
500
000 restricted shares of Pacific Ventures' common stock while simultaneously issuing 2
500




 Pacific Ventures became the holding company for Sn&#246;bar Holdings
 Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries comprising Snobar Trust (Trust)
 International Production Impex Corporation (IPIC)
 and MAS Global Distributors




 Pacific Ventures operated as an insurance holding company and through its subsidiaries
 marketed and underwrote specialized property and casualty coverage in the general aviation insurance marketplace.&#160; However
 in 1997
 after selling several of its divisions




 the business operations changed to that of Sn&#246;bar Holdings and the discussions of business operations accompanying this filing are solely that of Sn&#246;bar Holdings and its affiliates and subsidiaries comprising of Snobar Trust
 IPIC




 Inc. (Sn&#246;bar Holdings) was formed in the State of Delaware on January 7
 2013.&#160; Sn&#246;bar Holdings is the trustor and sole beneficiary of Snobar Trust
 a California trust (Trust)
 which was formed in June 1
 2013. The current trustee that holds legal title to the Trust is Clark Rutledge
 who is the father of Shannon Masjedi
 who controls Sn&#246;bar Holdings. The Trust owns 100% of the shares of International Production Impex Corporation
 a California corporation (IPIC)
 which was formed on August 2
 2001. IPIC is in the business of selling alcohol-infused ice cream and ice-pops
 and holds all of the rights to the liquor licenses to sell such products and trade names Sn&#246;Bar. As such
 the Trust holds all ownership interest of IPIC and its liquor licenses
 permitting IPIC to sell its product to distributors
 with all income
 expense
 gains and losses rolling up to the Trust
 of which Sn&#246;bar Holdings is the sole beneficiary.&#160; Sn&#246;bar Holdings also owns 99.9% of the shares of MAS Global Distributors
 Inc.
 a California corporation (MGD). MGD is in the business of selling and leasing freezers and providing marketing services.&#160; As a result of the foregoing
 Sn&#246;bar Holdings is the primary beneficiary of all assets




 Sn&#246;bar Holdings performs ongoing reassessments of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. As the assessment of Sn&#246;bar Holdings' management is that Sn&#246;bar Holdings has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's activities (it is responsible for establishing and operating IPIC)
 and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE and the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE's economic performance
 it was therefore concluded by management that Sn&#246;bar Holdings is the primary beneficiary of the Trust and IPIC. As such
 the Trust and IPIC were consolidated in the financial statements of Sn&#246;bar Holdings since the inception of the Trust
 in the case of the Trust
 and since the inception of Sn&#246;bar Holdings




 Suite 316

 Inc.
 a Delaware corporation (Sn&#246;bar Holdings)

 Inc.
 a California corporation (MGD). MGD is in the business of selling and leasing freezers and providing marketing services.&#160; As a matter of law
 IPIC may not be engaged in any business similar to MGD.&#160; As a result of the foregoing
 Sn&#246;bar Holdings is the beneficiary of all assets




 alcohol distribution company
 that is initially marketing two products: Sn&#246;Bar alcohol infused ice pops




 similar to popsicles on a stick
 but made with premium liquor such as premium tequila and vodka and are currently manufactured in three flavors
 Margarita
 Cosmopolitan and Mojito.&#160; The alcohol freezing technology used to produce these beverage bars can be applied to almost any alcohol type and mixture




 there are four flavors available: Brandy Alexander; Brandy Alexander with chocolate chips; Grasshopper; and Pink Squirrel.&#160; There are also numerous different liquor ice cream flavors in development in classic ice cream drink styles such as Coffee Liqueur Ice Cream
 Pi&#241;a Colada Sorbet
 Sherry Ice Cream




 whereby the alcohol content
 quality and flavor is not degraded during the production process. The technology is also applicable to other food and beverage products such as yogurt




























 and ice cream markets have consistently exhibited year-over-year growth
 and are projected to continue this positive trend.&#160; Not only are these products a part of an expanding market segment




 the Sn&#246;Bar brand was introduced in the USA in the state of Arizona. The brand was extremely well received and was immediately placed in the top chain stores and restaurants
 resorts including Total Wine and the Bevmo Chains.&#160; Due to its multiple applications and uses




 the Sn&#246;Bar brand was launched in Nevada. Immediately
 the Sn&#246;Bar products were in demand in all the major casinos and resorts.&#160;&#160; The Sn&#246;Bar brand joined forces with reputable hotels and resorts
 including
 but not limited to
 the Bellagio
 Golden Nugget
 Rio
 Wynn
 Encore
 TAO
 Caesars Palace
 Hilton
 The M and MGM. In Nevada
 IPIC's focus is to place the Sn&#246;Bar brand within all the venues of the hotels including catering and banquets
 room service




 the Sn&#246;Bar brand was launched in the state of Florida
 in cities including Miami
 Tampa
 Orlando
 Jacksonville and the panhandle. This expansion resulted in Sn&#246;Bar products being offered by reputable hotels and resorts
 including
 but not limited to
 Ritz Carlton Hotel
 Fountainbleau
 Hilton




 the Sn&#246;Bar brand was launched in California. Over 100 accounts with retailers for Sn&#246;Bar products were established in the 90 day period following the launch in California.&#160; The focus in California has been ensuring that the accounts are reordering product and being serviced and supported properly. Currently




 the largest retailer in the world
 approved the Sn&#246;Bar brand to be test marketed in a few stores in the Florida market. The first store sold out of more than 10 cases of Sn&#246;Bar products within the first two weeks prompting an 85 case reorder. After a three month trial period








 IPIC restructured its approach to distribution of Sn&#246;Bar products and scaled back the operating expenditures by reducing its expenses. Most notably






































 ice cream manufacturers continue to diversify their lines of frozen desserts in order to fit into various lifestyles.&#160; However
 most consumers are looking for an indulgence when eating ice creams
 which makes these products&#160; well situated&#160; with its ideal formula of two enjoyable products














 warehousing
 distribution
 and merchandising methods currently used for ice cream.&#160;&#160; Specifically
 the proprietary formulation and manufacturing method stabilize the alcohol molecules from interacting with ice crystals and milk proteins making it possible to mass-produce a solid alcohol-infused ice cream that has a flavoring system of up to 15% distilled spirits.&#160; To date




 not semi-soft or in a milk shake consistency like one would find at bars and restaurants:&#160;&#160; These products are ready-to-eat solid or can be blended into a cocktail.&#160;&#160; While Sn&#246;Bar products look like ice cream and frozen popsicles
 the Bureau of Alcohol
 Tobacco








 males have been the greater consumer of alcohol.&#160; The primary target market for these two products is adult women 21 to 45. An alcoholic-infused ice cream drink would appear to combine the best of both worlds for the female consumer. Of course
 to a large degree the market for frozen alcohol desserts includes all adults
 excluding those who have dietary
 medical




 similar to a popsicle on a stick
 and are currently manufactured in three flavors; Margarita
 Cosmopolitan
 and Mojito.&#160; Both recipes include premium liquors of blue agave tequila and vodka
 however
 the alcohol freezing technology can be applied to almost any alcohol type and mixture
























 initially sales are expected to be driven mostly by on-premise accounts.&#160; The spirits category represents over 650
000 licensed retail accounts absorbing sales of over 175 million x 9 liter equivalent cases annually. IPIC can viably reach 30% of this market
 approximately 195
000 outlets
 accounting for 52.5 million equivalent cases. While a core-target audience of females 21 to 65 years old have been highly accepting and positive regarding the product
 our market studies show that the actual acceptance band of the product is much wider
 and that if cost is not a purchase condition




 coupled with a focused launch and national distribution network








 drug stores were at nearly 2%




 resorts
 cruise lines and hotels.&#160; Additionally
 various celebrity branding and product endorsements are currently being explored.&#160; Initially
 IPIC will focus on major accounts in four core markets consisting of Southern California
 Phoenix
 Las Vegas and Miami. The larger vision is to sell products in grocery stores such as Kroger
 Wal-Mart and others




 allows Sn&#246;Bar to bring new consumers and revenue to our vendors
 hence creating incremental growth in their overall sales. A national direct mail campaign to liquor retailers and leading food service operators will support these efforts.&#160; By Sn&#246;Bar creating a new vehicle for distilled spirits
 many consumers will be tasting liqueurs and liquors for the first time




 night clubs
 restaurants
 resorts
 hotels
 event banquet and catering firms




 the target consumer is 21 to 45 year olds
 predominately females that frequent restaurants
 bars
 and events on a regular basis.&#160;&#160; While the consumer demographic is predominantly female




 Inc.
 a California corporation (MGD)
 formed in December 14
 2010
 a majority owned subsidiary of Sn&#246;bar Holdings







 it is anticipated that Sn&#246;Bar consumption will be strong in warm climates
 specialty venues
 cruise lines
 resorts


























 storage and aging of distilled products are primarily corn and other grains for whiskies and other spirits
 agave for tequila
 molasses for rum
 grapes for cognac
 sticks for the popsicles and milk and other dairy products for the ice cream. IPIC does not currently have any long-term supply agreements with third-party suppliers for the purchase of any of raw materials used in our products. From time to time
 these raw materials are affected by weather and other forces that may impact production and quality
 and
 ultimately
















 as well as with third-party distributors of its products . IPIC's products that are in inventory may be subject to spoliation
 theft
 or other hazards that could adversely affect the financial condition
 results of operations or business of IPIC. While IPIC tries to take precautions to prevent such occurrences
 the ice pops
 in particular
 require refrigeration to a certain temperature that if not maintained can cause the degradation in the products consistency. Ultimate end consumers may not maintain their freezers at the required temperatures which may cause them to believe that there ice-pops have partially melted and therefore they may return the ice-pops







 Sn&#246;Bar will partner with more food
 beverage and alcohol distributors. The Sn&#246;Bar products are primarily sold through direct sales forces to distributors. The product delivery will occur through frozen distribution channels. Transportation of the product from the manufacturing facility to customers will be handled by third parties contracted by IPIC. IPIC is utilizing frozen warehouse facilities in Los Angeles and Phoenix











 brand names and trade names that are important to its continued success. The Sn&#246;Bar brand is fully trademarked within the USA and is currently seeking worldwide trademark rights.&#160; IPIC's business could be adversely affected by the loss of any major brand or by material infringement of its intellectual property rights. The Sn&#246;Bar products are also subject to intellectual property risks because existing trademark laws offer only limited protection
 and the laws of some countries in which the Sn&#246;Bar products are or may be developed



























 brand image
 price
 service and innovation in response to consumer preferences. While the industry is highly fragmented
 major competitors on the alcohol-side of the business include Brown-Forman Corporation
 Diageo PLC
 Beam
 Inc
 Pernod Ricard S.A.
 Bacardi Limited
 Davide Campari Milano-S.P .A.
 Remy Cointreau S.A.
 and Constellation Brands
 Inc. and major competitors on the dessert-side of the business include such premium brands as Haagen Dazs and Dreyer's







 storage
 transportation
 distribution and sale of the Sn&#246;Bar products are subject to regulation by federal
 state




 Tobacco
 Firearms and Explosives regulates the U.S. spirits industry with respect to production
 blending
 bottling
 sales
 advertising
 and transportation of industry products. Also
 each state in the United States regulates the advertising
 promotion
 transportation
 sale
 and distribution of such products.&#160; Many of the key markets for IPIC's business
 distilled spirits are subject to federal excise taxes and/or customs duties
 as well as state/provincial
 local and other taxes. Sales of products containing alcohol could be adversely impacted by increases to excise tax rates
 which are considered from time to time by U.S. states and municipalities and in other key markets for IPIC's business. The effect of any future excise tax increases in any jurisdiction cannot be determined
 but it is possible that any future excise tax increases could have an adverse effect on IPIC's business







 the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act
 the Clean Water Act
 the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and Superfund (the environmental program established in the Comprehensive Environmental Response
 Compensation
 and Liability Act to address abandoned hazardous waste sites)







 2016
 Pacific Venture has 5 executives who help to manage the affairs of the corporation.&#160; On as needed basis

































 our business
 results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In those cases








 we face substantial competition in these areas
 and do not have as extensive a history of operating in these areas as some of our competitors.&#160; If we are unsuccessful in marketing and advertising alcohol infused frozen products






 our revenues
 margins and market share could be adversely affected
 any of which could significantly harm our business





 efforts and performance of our senior management and key technical personnel. It is anticipated that our executive officers will enter into employment agreements. However
 while it is customary to use employment agreements as a method of retaining the services of key personnel
 these agreements do not guarantee us the continued services of such employees. In addition
 we have not entered into employment agreements with most of our key personnel.&#160; The loss of our executive officers or our other key personnel
 particularly with little or no notice
 could cause delays on projects and could have an adverse impact on our client and industry relationships
 our business






 attract
 hire
 train and retain qualified creative
 technical and managerial personnel. We expect competition for personnel with the specialized creative and technical skills needed to create our products and provide our services will continue to intensify.&#160; We often hire individuals on a project-by-project basis
 and individuals who work on one or more projects for us may not be available to work on future projects.&#160; If we have difficulty identifying
 attracting
 hiring
 training and retaining such qualified personnel
 or incur significant costs in order to do so





 geopolitical and economic variables
 weather
 and other unpredictable external factors. We buy commodities such as corn and other grains
 molasses
 grapes
 sticks and plastic for the production
 packaging and distribution of our products. Availability
 increases and volatility in the prices of these commodities
 as well as products sourced from third parties and energy used in making
 distributing and transporting our products
 could increase the manufacturing and distribution costs of our products. While in the past we have been able to mitigate the impact of these cost increases through productivity improvements and pricing adjustments























 poor performance or financial default of a major distributor or one of its major customers could adversely affect our business. Industry consolidation could also adversely affect our margins and profitability. Though large customers can offer efficiencies and unique opportunities
 they can also seek to make significant changes in their volume of purchases
 represent a large number of competing products
 negotiate more favorable terms and seek price reductions





 supply


 supply
 manufacturing and license agreements for our supplies and products. These agreements vary depending on the particular supply and/or product






 speed and flexibility to meet changing and uncertain market conditions. Our success also depends in part on refining our cost structure and supply chains so that we have flexibility and are able to respond to market pressures to protect profitability and cash flow or ramp up quickly and effectively to meet demand. Failure to achieve the desired level of quality
 capacity or cost reductions could adversely affect our financial results. Despite our efforts to control costs and increase efficiency in our facilities






 many of which are outside of our control. As a result of these fluctuations
 financial planning and forecasting may be more difficult and comparisons of our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not necessarily be meaningful.&#160; Accordingly
 you should not rely on our annual and quarterly results of operations as any indication of future performance. Each of the risk factors described in this Risks Related to Our Business section
 and the following factors














































































































 the value of our common stock could decrease significantly in spite of our operating performance. In addition
 our business
 and the alcoholic beverage business
 has historically been cyclical and seasonal in nature







 have generated limited revenue to date


 our financial condition will deteriorate
 and we may be unable to achieve our business objectives
 including without limitation





 we had an accumulated stockholders' deficit of approximately $5
357
734 and recurring losses from operations as of December 31
 2016. We also had a working capital deficit of approximately $2
045
677 as of December 31
 2016. We intend to fund operations through raising additional capital through debt financing and equity issuances and increased lending activities which may be insufficient to fund our capital expenditures
 working capital or other cash requirements for the year ending December 31
 2016. We are continuing to seek additional funds to finance our immediate and long term operations. The successful outcome of future financing activities cannot be determined at this time and there is no assurance that if achieved
 we will have sufficient funds to execute our intended business plan or generate positive operating results. These factors
 among others
 raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The audit report for the fiscal years ended December 31




 which may not be available to us on acceptable terms
 or at all
 and
 if not available may require us to delay




 both near- and long-term
 will depend on many factors
 including




































 acquiring or investing in complimentary businesses
 products













 expand and defend the scope of our intellectual product portfolio
 including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make
 or that we may receive
 in connection with the licensing
 filing
 prosecution


















































 timing of and success of our co-branding
 licensing
























 which may adversely affect our ability to develop and market our alcohol-infused products. In addition
 we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us
 if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms
 we may be required to significantly delay
 scale back or discontinue the development or marketing of one or more of our products or product candidates or curtail our operations
 which will have a Material Adverse Effect on our business






 debt-financings
 or other third party funding or other collaborations
 strategic alliances or licensing arrangements. These financing activities may have an adverse impact on our stockholders' rights as well as our operations. For instance
 any debt financing may impose restrictive covenants on our operations or otherwise adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. In addition
 if we seek funds through arrangements with partners
 these arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies






 we may selectively pursue strategic acquisitions in our industry and related industries.&#160; We may not be able to consummate such acquisitions
 which could adversely impact our growth.&#160; If we do consummate acquisitions
 integrating an acquired company
 business or technology may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures
























































































 currency risks and the particular economic




 and the anticipated benefits from our future acquisitions may not materialize. In addition
 future acquisitions or dispositions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities
 including our common stock
 the incurrence of debt
 contingent liabilities or amortization expenses
 or write-offs of goodwill


























 hurricanes
 terrorist attacks
 floods
 fires
 power loss
 telecommunications failures
 computer viruses or other attempts to harm our systems
 and similar events. Our facilities are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes and are also subject to break-ins
 sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism. Some of our systems are not fully redundant
 and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at our Santa Monica
 California facility or manufacturing facility located in Orange County
 California could result in lengthy interruptions in our projects and our ability to deliver services. An error or defect in the software
 a failure in the hardware
 a failure of our backup facilities could delay our delivery of products and services and could result in significantly increased production costs
 hinder our ability to retain and attract clients and damage our brand if clients believe we are unreliable.&#160; Given our reliance on our industry relationships





 primarily due to changing consumer preferences and technological developments. The rapid growth of technology and shifting consumer tastes prevent us from being able to accurately predict the overall effect that changing consumer preferences may have on our potential revenue and profitability.&#160; If we are unable to develop and effectively market new products that adequately or competitively address the needs of these changing consumer preferences





 production
 labeling
 and marketing. Changes to regulation of the alcohol industry could include increased limitations on advertising and promotional activities or other non-tariff measures that could adversely impact our business. In addition
 we face government regulations pertaining to the health and safety of our employees and our consumers as well as regulations addressing the impact of our business on the environment
 domestically as well as internationally. Compliance with these health
 safety and environmental regulations may require us to alter our manufacturing processes and our sourcing. Such actions could adversely impact our results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition






 state and/or local level. Any increase in federal
 state or local excise taxes could have an adverse effect on our business by increasing prices and reducing demand
 particularly if excise tax levels increase substantially relative to those for beer and wine. In addition






 automobile and property insurance. We do not know
 however
 if we will be able to maintain insurance with adequate levels of coverage. In addition
 we do not know if we will be able to obtain and maintain coverage for the business in which we engage. No assurance can be given that an insurance carrier will not seek to cancel or deny coverage after a claim has occurred. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts
 which would adversely affect our business
























 if successful claims are brought against us
 we may incur substantial liability costs. If the use of our products harms customers or third parties
 or is perceived to harm such persons even when such harm is unrelated to our products


 there is a risk that the use of our products could cause our customers to have an adverse health event. If we cannot successfully defend our product liability claims
 we could incur substantial liability and costs. In addition
 regardless of merit or eventual outcome




000
000 million per occurrence and $5
000
000 million aggregate limit. We believe our product liability insurance coverage as supplemented by our umbrella insurance policy is sufficient in light of our current financial condition; however









 consultants and vendors
 and generally control access to and distribution of our software
 technology and other proprietary information. Despite these precautions
 it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our software
 technology and other proprietary information
 without authorization
 or to develop similar or superior technology independently. The steps we take may not prevent misappropriation of our technology




 we may be required to litigate in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights
 to protect our trade secrets




 with whom we co-developed our proprietary freezing technology


 including the fact that the manufacturer only has facilities in Southern California and is subject to the risk of earthquakes and other disasters. We do not have any other supplier for our products and if anything were to happen to this supplier
 including such supplier's business failure
























 fires
 floods
 power outages and other catastrophic events
 and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism. A disruption at our production facility could adversely impact our results of operations


 which is located in Southern California. A significant natural disaster
 such as an earthquake
 fire or a flood or a significant power outage could have a material adverse impact on our business
 financial condition or operating results. If there were a catastrophic failure at our major production facility
 our business would be adversely affected. The loss of a substantial amount of inventory &#8211; through fire
 other natural or man-made disaster
 contamination
 or otherwise &#8211; could result in a significant reduction in supply of the affected product or products. Similarly
 if we experienced a disruption in the supply of our products
 our business could suffer. A consequence of any of these supply disruptions could be our inability to meet consumer demand for the affected products for a period of time. In addition
 there can be no assurance that insurance proceeds would cover the replacement value of our products or other assets if they were to be lost. In addition
 if a catastrophe such as an earthquake
 fire
 flood or power loss should affect one of the third parties on which we rely
 our business prospects could be harmed. Moreover
 acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our third-party service providers
 partners





 including software that is integrated and used with internally developed software. These third-party technology licenses may not in the future be available to us on commercially reasonable terms
 or at all. The loss of any of these technology licenses could result in delays in performance of work until we identify
 license and integrate equivalent technology
 and we may not be able to identify
 license or integrate any such equivalent technology in a timely manner or at all. Any resulting delays in our performance could damage our reputation and result in a decrease in our revenues during the period of delay
 either of which could materially adversely affect our business





 regardless of their merit
 and any such assertions or prosecutions may adversely affect our business and/or our operating results. Irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims
 we would incur significant costs and diversion of resources relating to the defense of such claims
 which could have an adverse effect on our business and/or our operating results. If any claims or actions are asserted against us
 we may seek to obtain a license of a third-party's intellectual property rights; however





 the growth of our business could be adversely impacted
 which may
 in turn
 negatively affect our operating results or financial condition.&#160; In addition
 we believe that a critical contributor to our success has been our creative culture. As we attempt to grow
 we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture





 at times
 may even be contradictory. Our failure to comply with these overlapping regulatory structures could materially adversely affect our business






 which in turn could adversely affect alcoholic type products.&#160; In addition
 an increase in price levels generally
 or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector





















 adversely impacting our results of operations


 including strong employment
 consumer confidence and credit availability
 are important not only to the basic health of our consumer markets
 but also to our own financial condition. There are presently significant challenges in the global economy
 including high unemployment rates
 low consumer confidence
 record budget deficits and levels of government debt
 and fragile credit and housing markets. In addition
 instability in the global credit markets
 including the recent European economic and financial turmoil related to sovereign debt issues in certain countries
 the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world and other disruptions
 may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions. As a result
 consumers' increased price consciousness may endure
 which may affect consumers' willingness to pay for premium brands as well as the overall level of consumption of products containing alcohol
 particularly in bars
 restaurants
 nightclubs and other public environments where consumers drink spirits. Furthermore
 our suppliers and customers could experience cash flow problems
 increased costs or reduced availability of financing
 credit defaults
 and other financial hardships. These factors may increase our bad debt expense
 cause us to reduce the levels of unsecured credit that we may provide to customers and otherwise adversely impact our results of operations
 cash flows and financial condition. A prolonged global economic stagnation may impact our access to capital markets
 result in increased interest rates on debt that we may take on to expand operations






 public health initiatives
 product innovations
 changes in travel

 regulatory action or any litigation against companies in the industry may have an adverse effect on our business. Our success depends in part on fulfilling available opportunities to meet consumer needs and anticipating changes in consumer preferences with successful new products and product innovations. While we devote significant focus to the development of new products
 we may not be successful in their development or these new products may not be commercially successful. In addition
 global economic conditions or market trends could cause consumer preferences to trend away from our premium alcohol-infused popsicles and ice cream alternatives

 while we believe that our scale

 we nevertheless face a risk that a continuing consolidation of the large distilled spirits companies could cause us to experience competitive disadvantages. Our inability to manage these and other competitive factors successfully could adversely affect our results of operations

 of the factors which may delay or prevent the listing of our common stock on a more widely-traded and liquid market include the following: our stockholders' equity may be insufficient; the market value of our outstanding securities may be too low; our net income from operations may be too low; our common stock may not be sufficiently widely held; we may not be able to secure market makers for our common stock; and we may fail to meet the rules and requirements mandated by

 Inc. (Pacific Ventures or the Company) current structure was as a result of a reverse merger with Sn&#246;bar Holdings
 Inc. (Sn&#246;bar) through a share exchange.&#160; As the result of the reverse-merger
 Pacific Ventures became the holding company for Sn&#246;bar Holdings
 Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries comprising Snobar Trust (Trust)
 International Production Impex Corporation (IPIC)
 and MAS Global Distributors




 Pacific Ventures
 which was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 3
 1986
 operated as an insurance holding company and through its subsidiaries
 marketed and underwrote specialized property and casualty coverage in the general aviation insurance marketplace.&#160; However
 in 1997
 after selling several of its divisions




 Pacific Ventures became the holding company for Sn&#246;bar Holdings
 Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries comprising Snobar Trust (Trust)

 and MAS Global Distributors



Since the Share Exchange represents a change in control of the Company and a change in business operations
 the business operations changed to that of Sn&#246;bar Holdings and the discussions of business operations accompanying this filing are solely that of Sn&#246;bar Holdings 
 IPIC
 and MGD.



 and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the statements of financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The following discussion and analysis are based on Pacific Ventures' audited Financial Report







 2016 and 2015 include a summary of our significant accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below. In the opinion of management







 Pacific Ventures through these subsidiaries Sn&#246;bar
 IPIC and MGD
 offers solutions within the food
 beverage
 alcohol and hospitality industries. The Company is the trustor and beneficiary of Snobar Trust. Snobar Trust holds International Production Impex Corporation (IPIC). IPIC holds the rights of the liquor licenses to sell alcohol-infused ice cream and ice-pops products and trade names SnoBar. IPIC is a food and beverage
 alcohol distribution company that is engaged in marketing products
 such as SnoBar alcohol infused ice pops
 and SnoBar alcohol infused ice cream and sorbet. The SnoBar ice pops are frozen alcohol beverage bars
 similar to popsicles on a stick
 but made with liquor
 such as tequila and vodka. SnoBar ice pops are manufactured in approximately three flavors: Margarita
























 and ice cream markets have consistently exhibited year-over-year growth







 the Sn&#246;Bar brand was introduced in the USA in the state of Arizona. The brand was well received and was immediately placed in the top chain stores and restaurants







 the Sn&#246;Bar brand was launched in Nevada. Immediately
 the Sn&#246;Bar products were in demand in all the major casinos and resorts.&#160;&#160; The Sn&#246;Bar brand joined forces with reputable hotels and resorts
 including
 but not limited to
 the Bellagio
 Golden Nugget
 Rio
 Wynn
 Encore
 TAO
 Caesars Palace
 Hilton
 The M and MGM. In Nevada
 IPIC's focus is to place the Sn&#246;Bar brand within all the venues of the hotels including catering and banquets
 room service




 the Sn&#246;Bar brand was launched in the state of Florida
 in cities including Miami
 Tampa
 Orlando
 Jacksonville and the panhandle. This expansion resulted in Sn&#246;Bar products being offered by reputable hotels and resorts
 including
 but not limited to
 Ritz Carlton Hotel
 Fountainbleau
 Hilton







 the Sn&#246;Bar brand was launched in California. Over 100 accounts with retailers for Sn&#246;Bar products were established in the 90 day period following the launch in California




 the largest retailer in the world
 approved the Sn&#246;Bar brand to be test marketed in few stores in the Florida market. The first store sold out of more than 10 cases of Sn&#246;Bar products within the first two weeks prompting an 85 case reorder. After a three month trial period











 IPIC restructured its approach to distribution of Sn&#246;Bar products and scaled back the operating expenditures by reducing its expenses. Most notably




000 worth of Sn&#246;Bar products for distribution in Grand Cayman Island
 Slovenia
 Croatia
 Serbia and Cuba
 if and when trade is permissible with Cuba. Another contract provides for an exclusive right to distribute for a minimum term of two years with an aggregate of $700
000 worth of Sn&#246;Bar products for distribution in Puerto Rico
 Costa Rica
 Dominican Republic and Panama.&#160; The last contract provides for an exclusive right to distribute for a minimum term of two years with an aggregate of $700
000 worth of Sn&#246;Bar products for the first year and $300
000 worth of Sn&#246;Bar products for each year thereafter for distribution in mainland China
 Hong Kong























 including Australia








 where a large retail chain named Spec's has approved of offering Sn&#246;Bar products for sale







 resorts
 cruise lines and hotels worldwide.&#160; Additionally
 various celebrity branding and product endorsements are currently being explored.&#160; Initially
 the focus will be on establishing major accounts in four core markets consisting of Southern California
 Phoenix
 Las Vegas and Miami. The larger vision is to sell products in grocery stores such as Kroger
 Wal-Mart and others
 and thereafter to begin a national marketing program to all U.S. retailers. It is essentially a top down marketing plan where products are placed with the largest retailer then trickle down to the smallest seller in each market area. Furthermore
 by being quoted as Pacific Ventures Group







 we have incurred operating losses
 and as at December 31
 2016 and 2015

357

645 respectively. For the year ended December 31
 2016
 we have a working capital deficiency of approximately $2 million. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Additionally
 our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in their report for the years ended December 31




 and if we cannot continue as a going concern
























000 to sustain operations for the next twelve (12) months. Our plan is to increase sales revenue from the sale of the Sn&#246;Bar products to meet our operating needs. However
 it is very likely that we will not be able to increase our sale revenue sufficiently to meet these needs in time. It is also unlikely that we will be able to satisfy all of our obligations to pay interest and repay principal in the estimated aggregate amount of $570
800 due and payable within the next twelve (12) months under the various forms of our outstanding debt.&#160; Although we have been able to extend the maturity dates as well as repayment terms of a substantial amount of such debt
 there is no assurance that we will be able to further extend such repayments or maturity dates to avoid a default
 as such further extension depends on the consent of the holders of such debt.&#160; If we are unable to make such payments and repayments and unable to extend and delay required payments or maturities of such debt
 the holders of such debt will have the right to take legal action seeking enforcement of the debt. If any legal action is taken against us
 we would face the risk of having to deplete our limited cash resources to defend against such suit or face the entry of a default judgment. In either event
 such action would have grave impact on our operations.&#160; Our ability to continue operations will be dependent upon the successful completion of additional long-term or permanent equity financing
 the support of creditors and shareholders
 and
 ultimately
 the achievement of profitable operations. There can be no assurances that we will be successful
 which would in turn significantly affect our ability to be successful in our new business plan. If not

 Inc. (the Company or Pacific Ventures) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 3
 1986
 under the name AOA Corporation. On November 12
 1991
 the Company changed its name to American Eagle Group
 Inc. On October&#160;22
 2012
 the Company changed its name to Pacific Ventures Group




 came from a reverse merger with Sn&#246;bar Holdings

 2015
 by Pacific Ventures Group
 Inc. and its stockholders through a share exchange agreement with Sn&#246;bar Holdings
 Inc. (Sn&#246;bar Holdings)
 pursuant to which Pacific Ventures acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Sn&#246;bar Holdings' Class A and Class B common stock in exchange for 22
500
000 restricted shares of Pacific Ventures' common stock while simultaneously issuing 2
500
000 shares of Pacific Ventures' restricted common stock to certain other persons.



 Pacific Ventures became the holding company for Sn&#246;bar Holdings


 and MAS Global Distributors




 Pacific Ventures operated as an insurance holding company and through its subsidiaries
 marketed and underwrote specialized property and casualty coverage in the general aviation insurance marketplace.&#160; However
 in 1997
 after selling several of its divisions



Since the Share Exchange represents a change in control of the Company and a change in business operations
 the business operations changed to that of Sn&#246;bar Holdings and the discussions of business operations accompanying this filing are solely that of Sn&#246;bar Holdings 
 IPIC
 and MGD.




 Inc. (Sn&#246;bar Holdings) was formed in the State of Delaware on January 7
Trust
 a California trust (Trust)
 which was formed in June 1
 2013. The current trustee that holds legal title to the Trust is Clark Rutledge
 who is the father of Shannon Masjedi
The Trust owns 100% of the shares of International Production Impex Corporation
 a California corporation (IPIC)
 which was formed on August 2



 permitting IPIC to sell its product to distributors
 with all income
 expense
 gains and losses rolling up to the Trust

 Inc.
marketing services.&#160; As a result of the foregoing
is the primary beneficiary of all assets
 liabilities and any income received from the business of the Trust and IPIC through the Trust and is the parent company of MGD.




 Sn&#246;bar Holdings performs ongoing reassessments of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. As the assessment of Sn&#246;bar Holdings' management is that Sn&#246;bar Holdings has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's activities (it is responsible for establishing and operating IPIC)
 and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE and the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE's economic performance
 it was therefore concluded by management that Sn&#246;bar Holdings is the primary beneficiary of the Trust and IPIC. As such
 the Trust and IPIC were consolidated in the financial statements of Sn&#246;bar Holdings since the inception of the Trust
 in the case of the Trust
 and since the inception of Sn&#246;bar Holdings








































 Inc.
 Sn&#246;bar Holdings and its subsidiaries
 in which Sn&#246;bar Holdings has a controlling voting interest and entities consolidated under the variable interest entities (VIE) provisions of ASC 810





 liabilities




 a VIE is a corporation
 partnership
 limited-liability corporation
 trust
 or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets that either (1) has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out its principal activities without additional subordinated financial support
 (2)&#160;has a group of equity owners that is unable to make significant decisions about its activities
 (3)&#160;has a group of equity owners that does not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations or (4) the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity
 their rights to receive the expected residual returns of the entity
 or both and substantially all of the entity's activities (for example




 contractual or other financial interest in the VIE (a variable interest holder) that has both of the following characteristics: a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and b) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE



of a variable interest entity (VIE) and the VIE are under common control
 the primary beneficiary shall initially measure the assets
 liabilities
 and non-controlling interests of the VIE at amounts at which they are carried in the accounts of the reporting entity that controls the VIE (or would be carried if the rep








&#160;- The consolidated financial statements include Pacific Ventures
 Inc.
 a Delaware corporation
 Sn&#246;bar Holdings
 Inc. a Delaware corporation (Sn&#246;bar Holdings)
 MAS Global Distributors
 Inc.
 a California corporation (MGD)
 International Production Impex Corporation
 a California corporation (IPIC)
 and Snobar Trust
 a California trust (Trust)
 which was established to hold IPIC





&#160;- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities



































&#160;- Sales revenues are generally recognized in accordance with the SAB 104 Public Company Guidance
 when an agreement exists and price is determinable
 the products are shipped to the customers or services are rendered
 net of discounts
 returns and allowance and collectability is reasonably assured. We are often entitled to bill our customers and receive payment from our customers in advance of recognizing the revenue. In the instances in which we have received payment from our customers in advance of recognizing revenue



- Certain amounts are received pursuant to agreements or contracts and may only be used in the conduct of specified transactions or the related services are yet to be performed. These amounts are recorded as unearned or deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue in the year/period the related expenses are incurred or services are performed. As at 12/31/2016
 the Company has $15
042 in deferred revenue as a result of prepayment by two of its customers.&#160; This is comparable to the Company year-end deferred revenue balance of $90








- The Company is involved in a variety of disputes
 claims
 and proceedings concerning its business operations and certain liabilities. We determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. We assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information. We develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters
 which involves an analysis of potential results
 assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual
 or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts
 they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
 cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination
 judgment or settlement occurs.&#160; As at 12/31/2016
 the Company has $39




 on January 28
 2016
 a labor dispute between IPIC and a former employee was ruled in favor of the former employee by the Labor Commissioner of the State of California.&#160; This finding resulted in compensation expenses of $29
102.76 and an accrued liability of the same amount on IPIC book for the year ended December 31



&#8211; Non-recurring items come from discontinued operations
 extraordinary items
 unusual or infrequent items
 or changes in accounting principles. Because these items are infrequent and did not constitute operating items they are not included in the Company's result of operation.&#160; During the year ended 12/31/2016 the Company recorded a gain/loss of $33



&#160;- The Company considers highly liquid instruments with original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.&#160;As at 12/31/2016
 the Company has $ 25
284 in Cash and Cash equivalent




&#160;- Accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts. The allowance is calculated based upon the level of past due accounts and the relationship with and financial status of our customers. The Company did not write off any bad debt during the years ended&#160; 12/31/2016 and 2015



&#160;- Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost has been determined using the first-in
 first-out method. Inventory quantities on-hand are regularly reviewed
 and where necessary
 reserves for excess and unusable inventories are recorded. Inventory consists of finished goods and includes ice cream
 popsicles and the related packaging materials.&#160; As at 12/31/2016
 the Company has $0 in Inventories




































&#160;- Deferred taxes are provided on an asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the difference between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when
 in the opinion of management



&#160;- Income/(loss) per share of common stock is calculated by dividing the net income/(loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The Company has no potentially dilutive securities. Accordingly



&#160;- Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and includes expenditures that substantially increase the useful lives of existing property and equipment. Maintenance
 repairs
 and minor renovations are expensed as incurred. Upon sale or retirement of property and equipment
 the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the respective accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included in the results of operations. The Company provides for depreciation of property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives or the term of the lease
 as appropriate. The estimated useful lives are as follows: vehicles
 five years; office furniture and equipment
 three to fifteen years; equipment



&#160;- The carrying amounts of Pacific Ventures' financial instruments
 which include cash
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable




&#160;- Financial instruments that potentially subject Pacific Ventures to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions within the United States which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to limits of approximately $250




 During the year ended 12/31/2016
 the Company incurred $62
505.44 in Marketing and Advertising
 compared to $22
060 for the year ended 12/31/2015.

&#160;- The Company considers revenue recognition and the valuation of accounts receivable
 allowance for doubtful accounts




In June 2009
 the FASB established the Accounting Standards Codification (Codification or ASC) as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP).&#160; Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of GAAP for SEC registrants.&#160; Existing GAAP was not intended to be changed as a result of the Codification





 FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03
 Interest &#8211; Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs
&#160;to simplify presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability
 consistent with debt discounts. The ASU does not affect the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs. For public companies
 the ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2015
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations



































 FASB issued ASU No. 2015-04
 Compensation &#8211; Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an Employer's Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets
&#160;which permits the entity to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the entity's fiscal year-end and apply that practical expedient consistently from year to year. The ASU is effective for public business entities for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2015
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations



 FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05
 Intangibles &#8211; Goodwill and Other &#8211; Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement
 which provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If such includes a software license
 then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not include a software license
 the customer should account for it as a service contract. For public business entities
 the ASU is effective for annual periods
 including interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December 15
 2015. Early application is permitted. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations





 FASB issued ASU No. 2015-06
 Earnings Per Share (Topic 260): Effects on Historical Earnings per Unit of Master Limited Partnership Dropdown Transactions
 which specifies that
 for purposes of calculating historical earnings per unit under the two-class method
 the earnings (losses) of a transferred business before the date of a drop down transaction should be allocated entirely to the general partner. In that circumstance
 the previously reported earnings per unit of the limited partners (which is typically the earnings per unit measure presented in the financial statements) would not change as a result of the dropdown transaction. Qualitative disclosures about how the rights to the earnings (losses) differ before and after the dropdown transaction occurs for purposes of computing earnings per unit under the two-class method also are required. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2015
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations



 FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10
 Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation. The update removes all incremental financial reporting requirements from GAAP for development stage entities
 including the removal of Topic 915 from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. In addition
 the update adds an example disclosure in Risks and Uncertainties (Topic 275) to illustrate one way that an entity that has not begun planned principal operations could provide information about the risks and uncertainties related to the company's current activities. Furthermore
 the update removes an exception provided to development stage entities in Consolidations (Topic 810) for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity-which may change the consolidation analysis
 consolidation decision
 and disclosure requirements for a company that has an interest in a company in the development stage. The update is effective for the annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014
 including interim periods therein. Early application is permitted&#160; with the first annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity's financial statements have not yet been issued (Public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). Our company adopted this pronouncement for year ended December 31



 FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12
 Compensation &#8211; Stock Compensation (Topic 718); Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period. The amendments in this ASU apply to all reporting entities that grant their employees share-based payments in which the terms of the award provide that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period. The amendments require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. For all entities
 the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15
 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments in this ASU either (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. If retrospective transition is adopted
 the cumulative effect of applying this Update as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements should be recognized as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance at that date. Additionally
 if retrospective transition is adopted
 an entity may use hindsight in measuring and recognizing the compensation cost. This updated guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations
 cash flows or financial condition.&#160; We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations






































 the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 on Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) &#8211; Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. Currently
 there is no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so
 the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically
 the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans
 (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management's plans
 (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated
 and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations

 which was formed in June 1
 2013. The current trustee that holds legal title to the Trust is Clark Rutledge
&#13;who is the father of Shannon Masjedi
 who controls&lt;/font&gt;&amp;#160;Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings.&amp;#160;&lt;font style=background-color: #FEFEFE&gt;The&#13;Trust owns 100% of the shares of International Production Impex Corporation
 a California corporation (&amp;#34;IPIC&amp;#34;)
 which&#13;was formed on August 2
 2001. IPIC&lt;/font&gt;&amp;#160;is in the business of selling alcohol-infused ice cream and ice-pops
 and holds&#13;all of the rights to the liquor licenses to sell such products&amp;#160;&lt;font style=background-color: #FEFEFE&gt;and trade names &amp;#34;Sn&amp;#246;Bar&amp;#34;.&#13;As such
&lt;/font&gt;&amp;#160;the Trust holds all ownership interest of IPIC and its liquor licenses
 permitting IPIC to sell its product&#13;to distributors
 with all income
 expense
 gains and losses rolling up to the Trust
 of which Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings is the sole&#13;beneficiary.&amp;#160; Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings&amp;#160;&lt;font style=background-color: #FEFEFE&gt;also owns 99.9% of the shares of MAS Global&#13;Distributors
 Inc.
 a California corporation (&amp;#34;MGD&amp;#34;). MGD is in the business&lt;/font&gt;&amp;#160;of selling and leasing freezers&#13;and providing&amp;#160;&lt;font style=background-color: #FEFEFE&gt;marketing services.&amp;#160; As a result of the foregoing
&lt;/font&gt;&amp;#160;Sn&amp;#246;bar&#13;Holdings&amp;#160;&lt;font style=background-color: #FEFEFE&gt;is the primary beneficiary of all assets

 Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings performs ongoing reassessments of whether it is the primary beneficiary&#13;of a VIE. As the assessment of Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings' management is that Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings has the power to direct the activities&#13;of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's activities (it is responsible for establishing and operating IPIC)
 and the obligation&#13;to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE and the right to receive benefits from the VIE that&#13;could potentially be significant to the VIE's economic performance
 it was therefore concluded by management that Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings&#13;is the primary beneficiary of the Trust and IPIC. As such
 the Trust and IPIC were consolidated in the financial statements of&#13;Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings since the inception of the Trust
 in the case of the Trust
 and since the inception of Sn&amp;#246;bar Holdings

 Inc.

 (2)&amp;#160;has a group of equity owners that is unable to make significant decisions about its activities
 (3)&amp;#160;has&#13;a group of equity owners that does not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations&#13;or (4) the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity
&#13;their rights to receive the expected residual returns of the entity
 or both and substantially all of the entity's activities (for&#13;example

 contractual or other financial interest in the VIE (a variable interest&#13;holder) that has both of the following characteristics: a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly&#13;impact the VIE's economic performance and b) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to&#13;the VIE

 FASB&#13;issued Accounting Standards Update (&amp;#34;ASU&amp;#34;) No. 2015-03
 &amp;#34;Interest &amp;#150; Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30):&#13;Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs&amp;#34;
&amp;#160;to simplify presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that&#13;debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying&#13;amount of that debt liability
 consistent with debt discounts. The ASU does not affect the recognition and measurement guidance&#13;for debt issuance costs. For public companies
 the ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning&#13;after December 15
 2015
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. We are currently reviewing&#13;the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations

 FASB&#13;issued ASU No. 2015-04
 &amp;#34;Compensation &amp;#150; Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date&#13;of an Employer's Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets&amp;#34;
&amp;#160;which permits the entity to measure defined benefit plan&#13;assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the entity's fiscal year-end and apply that practical expedient consistently&#13;from year to year. The ASU is effective for public business entities for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning&#13;after December 15
 2015
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. We are currently reviewing&#13;the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations

 FASB&#13;issued ASU No. 2015-05
 &amp;#34;Intangibles &amp;#150; Goodwill and Other &amp;#150; Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's&#13;Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement&amp;#34;
 which provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing&#13;arrangement includes a software license. If such includes a software license
 then the customer should account for the software&#13;license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not include&#13;a software license
 the customer should account for it as a service contract. For public business entities
 the ASU is effective&#13;for annual periods
 including interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December 15
 2015. Early application&#13;is permitted. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of&#13;operations

 FASB&#13;issued ASU No. 2015-06
 &amp;#34;Earnings Per Share (Topic 260): Effects on Historical Earnings per Unit of Master Limited Partnership&#13;Dropdown Transactions&amp;#34;
 which specifies that
 for purposes of calculating historical earnings per unit under the two-class&#13;method
 the earnings (losses) of a transferred business before the date of a drop down transaction should be allocated entirely&#13;to the general partner. In that circumstance
 the previously reported earnings per unit of the limited partners (which is typically&#13;the earnings per unit measure presented in the financial statements) would not change as a result of the dropdown transaction.&#13;Qualitative disclosures about how the rights to the earnings (losses) differ before and after the dropdown transaction occurs for&#13;purposes of computing earnings per unit under the two-class method also are required. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning&#13;after December 15
 2015
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted. We are currently reviewing&#13;the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations

 FASB&#13;issued ASU No. 2014-10
 &amp;#34;Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
&#13;Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810
 Consolidation&amp;#34;. The update removes all incremental&#13;financial reporting requirements from GAAP for development stage entities
 including the removal of Topic 915 from the FASB Accounting&#13;Standards Codification. In addition
 the update adds an example disclosure in Risks and Uncertainties (Topic 275) to illustrate&#13;one way that an entity that has not begun planned principal operations could provide information about the risks and uncertainties&#13;related to the company's current activities. Furthermore
 the update removes an exception provided to development stage entities&#13;in Consolidations (Topic 810) for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity-which may change the consolidation&#13;analysis
 consolidation decision
 and disclosure requirements for a company that has an interest in a company in the development&#13;stage. The update is effective for the annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014
 including interim periods therein.&#13;Early application is permitted&amp;#160; with the first annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity's financial&#13;statements have not yet been issued (Public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). Our company adopted&#13;this pronouncement for year ended December 31

 FASB&#13;issued ASU No. 2014-12
 &amp;#34;Compensation &amp;#150; Stock Compensation (Topic 718); Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the&#13;Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period&amp;#34;. The amendments&#13;in this ASU apply to all reporting entities that grant their employees share-based payments in which the terms of the award provide&#13;that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period. The amendments require that&#13;a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance&#13;condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that&#13;affect vesting to account for such awards. For all entities
 the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods and interim&#13;periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15
 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments&#13;in this ASU either (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or (b) retrospectively to all awards&#13;with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements&#13;and to all new or modified awards thereafter. If retrospective transition is adopted
 the cumulative effect of applying this Update&#13;as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements should be recognized as an adjustment to&#13;the opening retained earnings balance at that date. Additionally
 if retrospective transition is adopted
 an entity may use hindsight&#13;in measuring and recognizing the compensation cost. This updated guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our results&#13;of operations
 cash flows or financial condition.&amp;#160; We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there&#13;will be any impact on our results of operations

 the&#13;FASB issued ASU 2014-15 on &amp;#34;Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) &amp;#150; Disclosure of Uncertainties&#13;about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&amp;#34;. Currently
 there is no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management's&#13;responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern or to provide&#13;related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so
 the amendments are intended to&#13;reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity's ability&#13;to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards.&#13;Specifically
 the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every reporting&#13;period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans
 (4) require&#13;certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management's plans
 (5) require an express&#13;statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated
 and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year&#13;after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). We are currently reviewing the provisions&#13;of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations

The amendments require that a performance target that affects&#13;vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity&#13;should apply existing guidance in Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account&#13;for such awards. For all entities
 the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those&#13;annual periods beginning after December 15
 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments in this ASU&#13;either (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance&#13;targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all&#13;new or modified awards thereafter. If retrospective transition is adopted
 the cumulative effect of applying this Update as of&#13;the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements should be recognized as an adjustment to the&#13;opening retained earnings balance at that date. Additionally
 if retrospective transition is adopted
 an entity may use hindsight&#13;in measuring and recognizing the compensation cost. This updated guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our results&#13;of operations
 cash flows or financial condition.&amp;#160; We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there&#13;will be any impact on our results of operations
 cash flows or financial condition.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in&gt;&amp;#160;In August 2014
 the&#13;FASB issued ASU 2014-15 on &amp;#34;Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) &amp;#150; Disclosure of Uncertainties&#13;about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&amp;#34;. Currently
 there is no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management's&#13;responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern or to provide&#13;related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so
 the amendments are intended to&#13;reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity's ability&#13;to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards.&#13;Specifically
 the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every reporting&#13;period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans
 (4) require&#13;certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management's plans
 (5) require an express&#13;statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated
 and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year&#13;after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). We are currently reviewing the provisions&#13;of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]









The Company and
Nature of Business

Inc. (the &#34;Company&#34; or &#34;Pacific Ventures&#34;) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on October
3
 1986
 under the name AOA Corporation. On November 12
 1991
 the Company changed its name to American Eagle Group
 Inc. On October&#160;22
2012
 the Company changed its name to Pacific Ventures Group
 Inc.


of Pacific Ventures came from a reverse merger with Sn&#246;bar Holdings
 Inc. (&#34;Sn&#246;bar&#34;) through a share exchange.
The reverse merger entered on August 14
 2015
 by Pacific Ventures Group
 Inc. and its stockholders through a share exchange agreement
with Sn&#246;bar Holdings
 Inc. (&#34;Sn&#246;bar Holdings&#34;)
 pursuant to which Pacific Ventures acquired 100% of the issued
and outstanding shares of Sn&#246;bar Holdings' Class A and Class B common stock in exchange for 22
500
000 restricted shares of
Pacific Ventures' common stock while simultaneously issuing 2
500
000 shares of Pacific Ventures' restricted common stock to certain
other persons.


reverse-merger and Share Exchange
 Pacific Ventures became the holding company for Sn&#246;bar Holdings
 Inc. and its affiliates

 International Production Impex

 and MAS Global Distributors
 Inc. (&#34;MGD&#34;).


Pacific Ventures operated as an insurance holding company and through its subsidiaries
 marketed and underwrote specialized property
and casualty coverage in the general aviation insurance marketplace.&#160; However
 in 1997
 after selling several of its divisions
the Company's remaining insurance operations were placed into receivership and the Company ceased operating its insurance business.


represents a change in control of the Company and a change in business operations
 the business operations changed to that of Sn&#246;bar
Holdings and the discussions of business operations accompanying this filing are solely that of Sn&#246;bar Holdings and its affiliates
and subsidiaries comprising of Snobar&#160;
IPIC
 and MGD.


Inc. (&#34;Sn&#246;bar Holdings&#34;) was formed in the State of Delaware on January 7

are considered variable interest entities (&#34;VIEs&#34;) and Sn&#246;bar Holdings is identified as the primary beneficiary
of the Trust and IPIC. Under ASC 810
 Sn&#246;bar Holdings performs ongoing reassessments of whether it is the primary beneficiary
of a VIE. As the assessment of Sn&#246;bar Holdings' management is that Sn&#246;bar Holdings has the power to direct the activities

2.&#160; SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

&#160;-
The consolidated financial statements include Pacific Ventures
 Inc.
 a Delaware corporation
 Sn&#246;bar Holdings
 Inc. a Delaware
corporation (&#34;Sn&#246;bar Holdings&#34;)
 MAS Global Distributors
 Inc.
 a California corporation (&#34;MGD&#34;)
 International
Production Impex Corporation
 a California corporation (&#34;IPIC&#34;)
 and Snobar Trust
 a California trust (&#34;Trust&#34;)
which was established to hold IPIC
 which in turn holds liquor licenses. All inter-company accounts have been eliminated during
consolidation.&#160; See the discussion in Note 1 above for variable interest entity treatment of the Trust and IPIC.

&#160;-
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

&#160;-
Sales revenues are generally recognized in accordance with the SAB 104 Public Company Guidance
 when an agreement exists and price
is determinable
 the products are shipped to the customers or services are rendered
 net of discounts
 returns and allowance and
collectability is reasonably assured. We are often entitled to bill our customers and receive payment from our customers in advance
of recognizing the revenue. In the instances in which we have received payment from our customers in advance of recognizing revenue
we include the amounts in deferred or unearned revenue on our consolidated balance sheet.

-
Certain amounts are received pursuant to agreements or contracts and may only be used in the conduct of specified transactions
or the related services are yet to be performed. These amounts are recorded as unearned or deferred revenue and are recognized
as revenue in the year/period the related expenses are incurred or services are performed. As at 12/31/2016
 the Company has $15
042
in deferred revenue as a result of prepayment by two of its customers.&#160; This is comparable to the Company year-end deferred
revenue balance of $90
042 as at 12/31/2015.

Shipping and Handling
Costs&#160;

-
The Company is involved in a variety of disputes
 claims
 and proceedings concerning its business operations and certain liabilities.
We determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and
can be reasonably estimated. We assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available
information. We develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters
which involves an analysis of potential results
 assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Should developments
in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a
material accrual
 or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts
 they
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
 cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in
which such change in determination
 judgment or settlement occurs.&#160; As at 12/31/2016
 the Company has $39
307.59 in disputed
liabilities on its balance sheet.


 on January
28
 2016
 a labor dispute between IPIC and a former employee was ruled in favor of the former employee by the Labor Commissioner
of the State of California.&#160; This finding resulted in compensation expenses of $29
102.76 and an accrued liability of the
same amount on IPIC book for the year ended December 31
 2016.

&#150;
Non-recurring items come from discontinued operations
 extraordinary items
 unusual or infrequent items
 or changes in accounting
principles. Because these items are infrequent and did not constitute operating items they are not included in the Company's result
of operation.&#160; During the year ended 12/31/2016 the Company recorded a gain/loss of $33
998 as non-recurring items.

&#160;-
The Company considers highly liquid instruments with original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.&#160;As
at 12/31/2016
 the Company has $ 25
284 in Cash and Cash equivalent
 compared to $210 as at 12/31/2015.

&#160;-
Accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible
accounts. The allowance is calculated based upon the level of past due accounts and the relationship with and financial status
of our customers. The Company did not write off any bad debt during the years ended&#160; 12/31/2016 and 2015
 and thus has not
set an allowance for doubtful accounts.

&#160;-
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost has been determined using the first-in
 first-out method. Inventory
quantities on-hand are regularly reviewed
 and where necessary
 reserves for excess and unusable inventories are recorded. Inventory
consists of finished goods and includes ice cream
 popsicles and the related packaging materials.&#160; As at 12/31/2016
 the Company
has $0 in Inventories
 compared to $2020 as at 12/31/2015.

&#160;-
Deferred taxes are provided on an asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary
differences and operating loss carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary
differences are the difference between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets
are reduced by a valuation allowance when
 in the opinion of management
 it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax
laws and rates on the date of enactment.

Net Income/(Loss)
Per Common Share
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The Company has no potentially dilutive securities. Accordingly
basic and dilutive income/(loss) per common share are the same.

&#160;-
Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and includes expenditures that substantially increase
the useful lives of existing property and equipment. Maintenance
 repairs
 and minor renovations are expensed as incurred. Upon
sale or retirement of property and equipment
 the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the respective
accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included in the results of operations. The Company provides for depreciation of property
and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives or the term of the lease
 as appropriate. The estimated
useful lives are as follows: vehicles
 five years; office furniture and equipment
 three to fifteen years; equipment
 three years.

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments
 which include cash
 accounts receivable
accounts payable
 and accrued expenses are representative of their fair values due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.

Concentration of
Credit Risk
primarily of cash and accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions within the United States
which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#34;FDIC&#34;) up to limits of approximately $250
000. The Company
has not experienced any losses with regard to its bank accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risk of loss on its cash
bank accounts.

&#160;-
 During the year ended 12/31/2016
the Company incurred $62
505.44 in Marketing and Advertising
 compared to $22
060 for the year ended 12/31/2015.

Critical Accounting
Policies
 allowance for doubtful
accounts
 and inventory and reserves as its significant accounting policies. Some of these policies require management to make
estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts in Pacific Ventures' financial statements.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements -&#160;
 the FASB established the Accounting Standards Codification (&#34;Codification&#34; or
&#34;ASC&#34;) as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities
in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (&#34;GAAP&#34;).&#160;
Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#34;SEC&#34;) issued under authority of federal securities
laws are also sources of GAAP for SEC registrants.&#160; Existing GAAP was not intended to be changed as a result of the Codification
and accordingly the change did not impact our financial statements.&#160; The ASC does change the way the guidance is organized
and presented.


 FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update (&#34;ASU&#34;) No. 2015-03
 &#34;Interest &#150; Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30):
Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs&#34;
&#160;to simplify presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that
debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying
amount of that debt liability
 consistent with debt discounts. The ASU does not affect the recognition and measurement guidance
for debt issuance costs. For public companies
 the ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after December 15
 2015
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. We are currently reviewing
the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations
 cash flows or financial condition.


 FASB
issued ASU No. 2015-04
 &#34;Compensation &#150; Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date
of an Employer's Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets&#34;
&#160;which permits the entity to measure defined benefit plan
assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the entity's fiscal year-end and apply that practical expedient consistently
from year to year. The ASU is effective for public business entities for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after December 15
 2015
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. We are currently reviewing
the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations
 cash flows or financial condition.


 FASB
issued ASU No. 2015-05
 &#34;Intangibles &#150; Goodwill and Other &#150; Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's
Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement&#34;
 which provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing
arrangement includes a software license. If such includes a software license
 then the customer should account for the software
license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not include
a software license
 the customer should account for it as a service contract. For public business entities
 the ASU is effective
for annual periods
 including interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December 15
 2015. Early application
is permitted. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of
operations
 cash flows or financial condition.

&#160;

 FASB
issued ASU No. 2015-06
 &#34;Earnings Per Share (Topic 260): Effects on Historical Earnings per Unit of Master Limited Partnership
Dropdown Transactions&#34;
 which specifies that
 for purposes of calculating historical earnings per unit under the two-class
method
 the earnings (losses) of a transferred business before the date of a drop down transaction should be allocated entirely
to the general partner. In that circumstance
 the previously reported earnings per unit of the limited partners (which is typically
the earnings per unit measure presented in the financial statements) would not change as a result of the dropdown transaction.
Qualitative disclosures about how the rights to the earnings (losses) differ before and after the dropdown transaction occurs for
purposes of computing earnings per unit under the two-class method also are required. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15
 2015
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted. We are currently reviewing
the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations
 cash flows or financial condition.


 FASB
issued ASU No. 2014-10
 &#34;Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810
 Consolidation&#34;. The update removes all incremental
financial reporting requirements from GAAP for development stage entities
 including the removal of Topic 915 from the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification. In addition
 the update adds an example disclosure in Risks and Uncertainties (Topic 275) to illustrate
one way that an entity that has not begun planned principal operations could provide information about the risks and uncertainties
related to the company's current activities. Furthermore
 the update removes an exception provided to development stage entities
in Consolidations (Topic 810) for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity-which may change the consolidation
analysis
 consolidation decision
 and disclosure requirements for a company that has an interest in a company in the development
stage. The update is effective for the annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014
 including interim periods therein.
Early application is permitted&#160; with the first annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity's financial
statements have not yet been issued (Public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). Our company adopted
this pronouncement for year ended December 31
 2014.


 FASB
issued ASU No. 2014-12
 &#34;Compensation &#150; Stock Compensation (Topic 718); Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the
Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period&#34;. The amendments
in this ASU apply to all reporting entities that grant their employees share-based payments in which the terms of the award provide
that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period. The amendments require that
a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance
condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that
affect vesting to account for such awards. For all entities
 the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods and interim
periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15
 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments
in this ASU either (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or (b) retrospectively to all awards
with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements
and to all new or modified awards thereafter. If retrospective transition is adopted
 the cumulative effect of applying this Update
as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements should be recognized as an adjustment to
the opening retained earnings balance at that date. Additionally
 if retrospective transition is adopted
 an entity may use hindsight
in measuring and recognizing the compensation cost. This updated guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our results
of operations
 cash flows or financial condition.&#160; We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there
will be any impact on our results of operations
 cash flows or financial condition.


 the
FASB issued ASU 2014-15 on &#34;Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) &#150; Disclosure of Uncertainties
about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&#34;. Currently
 there is no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management's
responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern or to provide
related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so
 the amendments are intended to
reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity's ability
to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards.
Specifically
 the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every reporting
period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans
 (4) require
certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management's plans
 (5) require an express
statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated
 and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year
after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). We are currently reviewing the provisions
of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations
 cash flows or financial condition.

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]










financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements
 the Company has incurred a net loss of $487
089 for the year ended December 31
 2016
 and has an accumulated
deficit of $5
357
734 as at December 31
 2016.


as a going concern
 the Company will need
 among other things
 additional capital resources. The Company is significantly dependent
upon its ability
 and will continue to attempt
 to secure equity and/or additional debt financing. There are no assurances that
the Company will be successful and without sufficient financing it would be unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern.


financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets
 or the
amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These unaudited consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty.




































The entire disclosure when substantial doubt is raised about the ability to continue as a going concern. Includes
 but is not limited to
 principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern
 management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the ability to meet its obligations
 and management's plans that alleviated or are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern.

Dec. 31
 2016







 - The consolidated
financial statements include Pacific Ventures
 Inc.
 a Delaware corporation
 Sn&#246;bar Holdings
 Inc. a Delaware corporation
(&#34;Sn&#246;bar Holdings&#34;)
 MAS Global Distributors
 Inc.
 a California corporation (&#34;MGD&#34;)
 International Production
Impex Corporation
 a California corporation (&#34;IPIC&#34;)
 and Snobar Trust
 a California trust (&#34;Trust&#34;)
 which
was established to hold IPIC
 which in turn holds liquor licenses. All inter-company accounts have been eliminated during consolidation.&#160;
See the discussion in Note 1 above for variable interest entity treatment of the Trust and IPIC.




 - The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
 at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.




 - Sales revenues
are generally recognized when an agreement exists and price is determinable
 the products are shipped to the customers or services
are rendered
 net of discounts
 returns and allowance and collectability is reasonably assured.





-
Certain amounts are received pursuant to agreements or contracts and may only be used in the conduct of specified transactions
or the related services are yet to be performed. These amounts are recorded as unearned or deferred revenue and are recognized
as revenue in the year/period the related expenses are incurred or services are performed. As at 12/31/2016
 the Company has $15
042
in deferred revenue as a result of prepayment by two of its customers.&#160; This is comparable to the Company year-end deferred
revenue balance of $90
042 as at 12/31/2015.




&#150;
The Company's shipping costs are all recorded as operating expenses for all periods presented.






&#160;-
The Company considers highly liquid instruments with original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.&#160;As
at 12/31/2016
 the Company has $ 25
284 in Cash and Cash equivalent
 compared to $210 as at 12/31/2015.







&#160;-
Accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible
accounts. The allowance is calculated based upon the level of past due accounts and the relationship with and financial status
of our customers. The Company did not write off any bad debt during the years ended&#160; 12/31/2016 and 2015
 and thus has not
set an allowance for doubtful accounts.







&#160;-
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost has been determined using the first-in
 first-out method. Inventory
quantities on-hand are regularly reviewed
 and where necessary
 reserves for excess and unusable inventories are recorded. Inventory
consists of finished goods and includes ice cream
 popsicles and the related packaging materials.&#160; As at 12/31/2016
 the Company
has $0 in Inventories
 compared to $2020 as at 12/31/2015.





 - Deferred taxes are provided
on an asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating
loss carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the
difference between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance when
 in the opinion of management
 it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date
of enactment.





- Income/ (loss) per share of common stock is calculated by dividing the net income/ (loss) by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the period. The Company has no potentially dilutive securities. Accordingly
 basic and dilutive
income (loss) per common share are the same.




 - Property and
equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and includes expenditures that substantially increase the useful lives
of existing property and equipment. Maintenance
 repairs
 and minor renovations are expensed as incurred. Upon sale or retirement
of property and equipment
 the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the respective accounts and the resulting
gain or loss is included in the results of operations. The Company provides for depreciation of property and equipment using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives or the term of the lease
 as appropriate. The estimated useful lives are as
follows: vehicles
 five years; office furniture and equipment
 three to fifteen years; equipment
 three years.





- The carrying amounts of Pacific Ventures' financial instruments
 which include cash
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable
 and
accrued expenses are representative of their fair values due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.




 - Financial
instruments that potentially subject Pacific Ventures to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and accounts receivable.
The Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions within the United States which are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (&#34;FDIC&#34;) up to limits of approximately $250
000. The Company has not experienced any losses with
regard to its bank accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risk of loss on its cash bank accounts.


2015 and 2014
 approximately 51% and 20% of total sales were to two distributors
 respectively.


 2014
 99%
 of accounts receivable
were from one distributor.&#160; There was no accounts receivable as of September 30
 2015.






&#160;-
 During the year ended 12/31/2016
the Company incurred $62
505.44 in Marketing and Advertising
 compared to $22
060 for the year ended 12/31/2015.





 - The Company
considers revenue recognition and the valuation of accounts receivable
 allowance for doubtful accounts
 and inventory and reserves
as its significant accounting policies. Some of these policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect
the reported amounts in Pacific Ventures' financial statements.




In
June 2009
 the FASB established the Accounting Standards Codification (&#34;Codification&#34; or &#34;ASC&#34;) as the source
of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (&#34;GAAP&#34;).&#160; Rules and
interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#34;SEC&#34;) issued under authority of federal securities
laws are also sources of GAAP for SEC registrants.&#160; Existing GAAP was not intended to be changed as a result of the Codification
and accordingly the change did not impact our financial statements.&#160; The ASC does change the way the guidance is organized
and presented.


 FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update (&#34;ASU&#34;) No. 2015-03
 &#34;Interest &#150; Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation
of Debt Issuance Costs&#34;
&#160; to simplify presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related
to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability
consistent with debt discounts. The ASU does not affect the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs. For public
companies
 the ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2015
 and interim
periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine
if there will be any impact on our results of operations
 cash flows or financial condition.


 FASB issued ASU No. 2015-04
&#34;Compensation &#150; Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an Employer's Defined
Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets&#34;
&#160; which permits the entity to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations
using the month-end that is closest to the entity's fiscal year-end and apply that practical expedient consistently from year to
year. The ASU is effective for public business entities for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December
15
 2015
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. We are currently reviewing the provisions
of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations
 cash flows or financial condition.


 FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05
&#34;Intangibles &#150; Goodwill and Other &#150; Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid
in a Cloud Computing Arrangement&#34;
 which provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes
a software license. If such includes a software license
 then the customer should account for the software license element of the
arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not include a software license
the customer should account for it as a service contract. For public business entities
 the ASU is effective for annual periods
including interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December 15
 2015. Early application is permitted. We are
currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations
 cash flows
or financial condition.


 FASB issued ASU No. 2015-06
&#34;Earnings Per Share (Topic 260): Effects on Historical Earnings per Unit of Master Limited Partnership Dropdown Transactions&#34;
which specifies that
 for purposes of calculating historical earnings per unit under the two-class method
 the earnings (losses)
of a transferred business before the date of a drop down transaction should be allocated entirely to the general partner. In that
circumstance
 the previously reported earnings per unit of the limited partners (which is typically the earnings per unit measure
presented in the financial statements) would not change as a result of the dropdown transaction. Qualitative disclosures about
how the rights to the earnings (losses) differ before and after the dropdown transaction occurs for purposes of computing earnings
per unit under the two-class method also are required. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2015
and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this
ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations
 cash flows or financial condition.


 FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10
&#34;Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
 Including an Amendment to
Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810
 Consolidation&#34;. The update removes all incremental financial reporting requirements
from GAAP for development stage entities
 including the removal of Topic 915 from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. In
addition
 the update adds an example disclosure in Risks and Uncertainties (Topic 275) to illustrate one way that an entity that
has not begun planned principal operations could provide information about the risks and uncertainties related to the company's
current activities. Furthermore
 the update removes an exception provided to development stage entities in Consolidations (Topic
810) for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity-which may change the consolidation analysis
 consolidation
decision
 and disclosure requirements for a company that has an interest in a company in the development stage. The update is effective
for the annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014
 including interim periods therein. Early application is permitted&#160;
with the first annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity's financial statements have not yet been issued (Public
business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). Our company adopted this pronouncement for year ended December
31
 2014.


 FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12
&#34;Compensation &#150; Stock Compensation (Topic 718); Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide
That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period&#34;. The amendments in this ASU apply to all reporting
entities that grant their employees share-based payments in which the terms of the award provide that a performance target that
affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period. The amendments require that a performance target that affects
vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity
should apply existing guidance in Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account
for such awards. For all entities
 the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those
annual periods beginning after December 15
 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments in this ASU
either (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance
targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all
new or modified awards thereafter. If retrospective transition is adopted
 the cumulative effect of applying this Update as of
the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements should be recognized as an adjustment to the
opening retained earnings balance at that date. Additionally
 if retrospective transition is adopted
 an entity may use hindsight
in measuring and recognizing the compensation cost. This updated guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our results
of operations
 cash flows or financial condition.&#160; We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there
will be any impact on our results of operations
 cash flows or financial condition.

 the
FASB issued ASU 2014-15 on &#34;Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) &#150; Disclosure of Uncertainties
about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&#34;. Currently
 there is no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management's
responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern or to provide
related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so
 the amendments are intended to
reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity's ability
to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards.
Specifically
 the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt
 (2) require an evaluation every reporting
period including interim periods
 (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans
 (4) require
certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management's plans
 (5) require an express
statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated
 and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year
after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). We are currently reviewing the provisions
of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations
