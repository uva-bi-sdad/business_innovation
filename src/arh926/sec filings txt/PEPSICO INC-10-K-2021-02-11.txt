The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020 resulted in challenging operating environments and affected almost all of the more than 200 countries and territories in which our products are made
 manufactured
 distributed or sold
 including as a result of travel bans and restrictions
 quarantines
 curfews
 restrictions on public gatherings
 shelter in place and safer-at-home orders
and closures. We expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business operations
 including our employees
 customers
 consumers
 bottlers
 contract manufacturers
 distributors
 joint venture partners
See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; for discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Also
Our products are primarily brought to market through direct-store-delivery (DSD)
 customer warehouse and distributor networks and are also sold directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms and retailers. The distribution system used depends on customer needs
We
 our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver beverages
Some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and distribution centers
 both company and third-party operated
 to customer warehouses. These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable
We distribute many of our products through third-party distributors.&#160;Third-party distributors are particularly effective when greater distribution reach can be achieved by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles. For example
 our foodservice and vending business distributes beverages
 foods and snacks to restaurants
 businesses
The principal ingredients we use in our beverage
 food and snack products are apple
 orange and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates
 aspartame
 corn
 corn sweeteners
 flavorings
 flour
 grapefruit
 oranges and other fruits
 oats
 potatoes
 raw milk
 rice
 seasonings
 sucralose
 sugar
 vegetable and essential oils
 and wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our key packaging materials include plastic resins

 aluminum
 glass
 closures
 cardboard and paperboard cartons. In addition
 we continue to integrate recyclability into our product development process and support the increased use of recycled content
 including recycled PET
 in our packaging. Fuel
adequate supplies of many of these items and have not experienced any significant continuous shortages that would prevent us from meeting our requirements. Many of these ingredients
 raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation
 and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders
 pricing agreements and derivative instruments
 including swaps and futures. In addition
 risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. When prices increase
 we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers. In addition
 we continue to make investments to improve the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply chain
We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions
 pursuant to which our suppliers

 Ya and Yachak. We also hold long-term licenses to use valuable trademarks in connection with our products in certain markets
 including Dole and Ocean Spray. We also distribute Bang Energy drinks and various Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. brands
 including Dr Pepper in certain markets
 Crush and Schweppes. Joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest either own or have the right to use certain trademarks
 such as Lipton
 Sabra and Starbucks. Trademarks remain valid so long as they are used properly for identification purposes
 and we emphasize correct use of our trademarks. We have authorized
 through licensing arrangements
 the use of many of our trademarks in such contexts as snack food joint ventures and beverage bottling appointments. In addition
 we license the use of our trademarks on merchandise that is sold at retail
We either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to certain of our products
 their packaging
Our businesses are affected by seasonal variations. Our beverage
 food and snack sales are generally highest in&#160;the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter. However
 taken as a whole
Our customers include wholesale and other distributors
 foodservice customers
 grocery stores
 drug stores
 convenience stores
 discount/dollar stores
 mass merchandisers
 membership stores
 hard discounters
 e-commerce retailers and authorized independent bottlers
 among others. We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for concentrate
We rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to the consumer. For our independent distributors and retailers
 these incentives include volume-based rebates
 product placement fees
 promotions and displays. For our independent bottlers
 these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs
 such as consumer incentives
 advertising support
 new product support
 and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include pricing discounts and promotions
 and other promotional offers. Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support
 such as point-of-purchase materials
 product placement fees
Changes to the retail landscape
 including increased consolidation of retail ownership
 the rapid growth of sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications
 including through subscription services and other direct-to-consumer businesses
 the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers
 as well as the international expansion of hard discounters
 and the current economic environment
 including in light of the COVID-19 pandemic
 continue to increase the importance of major customers. In 2020
 sales to Walmart Inc. (Walmart) and its affiliates
 including Sam&#8217;s Club (Sam&#8217;s)
 represented approximately 14% of our consolidated net revenue
 with sales reported across all of our divisions
 including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers
 which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. The loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our FLNA
Our beverage
 food and snack products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage
 food and snack companies that
 like us
 operate in multiple geographies
 as well as regional
 local and private label manufacturers and economy brands and other competitors
 including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally-sourced products. In many countries in which our products are sold
 including the United States
 The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Other beverage
 food and snack competitors include
 but are not limited to

 Conagra Brands
 Inc.
 Kellogg Company
 Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.
 The Kraft Heinz Company
 Link Snacks
 Inc.

 we and The Coca-Cola Company represented approximately 22% and 20%
 respectively

We are also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. We are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations
 including state consumer protection laws such as Proposition 65 in California
 which requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a substance listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects
We are subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside the United States
 including but not limited to laws and regulations governing food safety
 international trade and tariffs
 supply chain
 including the U.K. Modern Slavery Act
 occupational health and safety
 competition
 anti-corruption and data privacy
 including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In many jurisdictions
 compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions
 as is compliance with anti-corruption laws
 including the U.K. Bribery Act. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs
 as well as in-house and outside counsel and other experts
In addition
 certain jurisdictions have either imposed
 or are considering imposing
 new or increased taxes on the manufacture
 distribution or sale of our products
 ingredients or substances contained in
 or attributes of
 our products or commodities used in the production of our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages
 including non-caloric beverages
 while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g.
 sugar). Similarly
 some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain level of added sugar (or other sweetener) while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and some apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient
In addition
 certain jurisdictions have either imposed
 or are considering imposing
 product labeling or warning requirements or other limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products or the audience to whom products are marketed. These types of provisions have required that we highlight perceived concerns about a product
 warn consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products
In addition
 certain jurisdictions have either imposed or are considering imposing regulations designed to increase recycling rates or encourage waste reduction. These regulations vary in scope and form from deposit return systems designed to incentivize the return of beverage containers

 continuing concern over climate change may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements (in or outside of the United States) to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of greenhouse gases
 or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns. Our policy is to abide by all applicable environmental laws and regulations
 and we have internal programs in place with respect to our global environmental compliance. We have made
 and plan to continue making
 necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. While these expenditures have not had a material impact on our business
 financial condition or results of operations to date
 changes in environmental compliance requirements
 and any expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements
 could adversely affect our financial performance. In addition
 we and our subsidiaries are subject to environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business
 as well as remediation and related indemnification obligations in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations
 including those of businesses acquired by us or our subsidiaries. While these environmental remediation and indemnification obligations cannot be predicted with certainty
 such obligations have not had
 and are not expected to have
 a material impact on our capital expenditures

The following risks
 some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future
 can have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance
impacted and continue to impact us
 our business partners and consumers. While some of these measures have been lifted or eased in certain jurisdictions
We have seen and could continue to see changes in consumer demand as a result of COVID-19
 including the inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness
 quarantine or other restrictions
 store closures
rences
 particularly an increase in demand in the e-commerce channel
 Reduced demand for our products or changes in consumer purchasing patterns
 as well as continued economic uncertainty
 can adversely affect our customers&#8217; financial condition
 which can result in bankruptcy filings and/or an inability to pay for our products. In addition
 we may also continue to experience business disruptions as a result of COVID-19
 resulting from temporary closures of our facilities or facilities of our business partners or the inability of a significant portion of our or our business partners&#8217; workforce to work because of illness
 quarantine
 or travel or other governmental restrictions. Any sustained interruption in our or our business partners&#8217; operations
 distribution network or supply chain or any significant continuous shortage of raw materials or other supplies
 including personal protective equipment or sanitization products
 can negatively impact our business. We have also incurred
 and expect to continue to incur
 increased employee and operating costs as a result of COVID-19
 such as costs related to expanded benefits and frontline incentives
 the provision of personal protective equipment and increased sanitation
 allowances for credit losses
 upfront payment reserves and inventory write-offs
 which have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our profitability. In addition
 the increase in certain of our employees working remotely has resulted in increased demand on our information technology infrastructure
 which can be subject to failure
 disruption or unavailability
 and increased vulnerability to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents. Also
 continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us
The impact of COVID-19 has heightened
 or in some cases manifested
 certain of the other risks discussed herein. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain and will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market
 including the duration and scope of the pandemic
 the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines
 global economic conditions during and after the pandemic
 governmental actions that have been taken
 or may be taken in the future
 in response to the pandemic
 and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic
Demand for our products depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences
 including the types of products our consumers want and how they browse for
 purchase and consume them. Consumer preferences continuously evolve due to a variety of factors
 including: changes in consumer demographics
 consumption patterns and channel preferences (including continued rapid increases in the e-commerce and online-to-offline channels); pricing; product quality; concerns or perceptions regarding packaging and its environmental impact (such as single-use and other plastic packaging); and concerns or perceptions regarding the nutrition profile and health effects of
 or location of origin of
 ingredients or substances in our products. Concerns with any of the foregoing could lead consumers to reduce or publicly boycott the purchase or consumption of our products. Consumer preferences are also influenced by perception of our brand image or the brand images of our products
 the success of our advertising and marketing campaigns
 our ability to engage with our consumers in the manner they prefer
 including through the use of digital media
 and the perception of our use
or react to changes in consumer preferences and trends
 or make the right strategic investments to do so
 including investments in data analytics to understand consumer trends
 can lead to reduced demand for our products
 lead to inventory write-offs or erode our competitive and financial position
 thereby adversely affecting our business. In addition
Maintaining a positive reputation globally is critical to selling our products. Our reputation or brand image has in the past been
 and could in the future be
 adversely impacted by a variety of factors
 including: any failure by us or our business partners to maintain high ethical
 social
 business and environmental practices
 including with respect to human rights
 child labor laws and workplace conditions and employee health and safety; any failure to achieve our sustainability goals
 including with respect to the nutrition profile of our products
 packaging
 water use and our impact on the environment; any failure to address health concerns about our products or particular ingredients in our products
 including concerns regarding whether certain of our products contribute to obesity; our research and development efforts; any product quality or safety issues
 including the recall of any of our products; any failure to comply with laws and regulations; consumer perception of our advertising campaigns
 sponsorship arrangements
 marketing programs and use of social media; or any failure to effectively respond to negative or inaccurate comments about us on social media or otherwise regarding any of the foregoing. Damage to our reputation or brand image has in the past and could in the future decrease demand for our products
Product quality or safety issues
 including alleged mislabeling
 misbranding
 spoilage
 undeclared allergens
 adulteration or contamination
 whether as a result of failure to comply with food safety laws or otherwise
 have in the past and could in the future reduce consumer confidence and demand for our products
 cause production and delivery disruptions
 require product recalls and result in increased costs (including payment of fines and/or judgments) and damage our reputation
 all of which can adversely affect our business. Failure to maintain adequate oversight over product quality or safety can result in product recalls
 litigation
 government investigations or inquiries or civil or criminal proceedings
 all of which may result in fines
 penalties
 damages or criminal liability. Our business can also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality
 safety and integrity generally
Our products compete against products of international beverage
 food and snack companies that
 like us
 operate in multiple geographies
 as well as regional
 local and private label and economy brand manufacturers and other competitors
 including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally sourced products. In many countries in which our products are sold
 including the United States
 The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Our products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty
 taste
 price
 value
 quality
 product variety
 innovation
 distribution
 advertising
 marketing and promotional activity
 packaging
 convenience
 service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends. Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively promote or develop our existing products or introduce new products
 if our competitors spend more aggressively than we do or if we are otherwise unable to effectively respond to pricing pressure or compete effectively
 and we may be unable to grow or maintain sales or category share or we may need to increase capital
Failure to attract
Our business requires that we attract
 develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce. Our employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies and our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract
 retain
 develop and motivate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Any unplanned turnover or unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans to backfill current leadership positions
 including the Chief Executive Officer
 or failure to attract
 develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce
 including with key capabilities such as e-commerce and digital marketing and data analytic skills
 can deplete our institutional knowledge base
 erode our competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees
 higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. In addition
 failure to attract
We and our business partners use water in the manufacturing and sourcing of our products. Lack of available water of acceptable quality
 increasing focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations
 investors
 customers and consumers on water scarcity and increasing pressure to conserve and replenish water in areas of scarcity and stress may lead to: supply chain disruption; adverse effects on our operations or the operations of our business partners; higher compliance costs; capital expenditures (including investments in the development of technologies to enhance water efficiency and reduce consumption); higher production costs
 including less favorable pricing for water; the interruption or cessation of operations at
 or relocation of
 our facilities or the facilities of our business partners; failure to achieve our sustainability goals relating to water use; perception of our failure to act responsibly with respect to water use or to effectively respond to legal or regulatory requirements concerning water scarcity; or damage to our reputation
The retail landscape continues to evolve
 including rapid growth in e-commerce channels and hard discounters. Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain and develop successful relationships with e-commerce retailers and hard discounters
 while also maintaining relationships with our key customers operating in traditional retail channels (many of whom are also focused on increasing their e-commerce sales). Our business can be adversely affected if e-commerce channels and hard discounters take significant additional market share away from traditional retailers or we fail to find ways to create more powerful digital tools and capabilities for our retail customers to enable them to grow their businesses. In addition
 our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to profitably expand our own direct-to-consumer e-commerce capabilities. The retail industry is also impacted by increased consolidation of ownership and purchasing power
 particularly in North America
 Europe and Latin America
 resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power
 impacting our ability to compete in these areas. Consolidation also adversely impacts our smaller customers&#8217; ability to compete effectively
 resulting in an inability on their part to pay for our products or reduced or canceled orders of our products. Further
 we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers
 including Walmart
 to compete effectively. Any inability to resolve a significant dispute with any of our key customers
 a change in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers
 even if unrelated to us
 a significant reduction in sales to any key customer
Many of the raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products are sourced from countries experiencing civil unrest
 political instability or unfavorable economic conditions. Some raw materials and supplies
 including packaging materials such as recycled PET
 are available only from a limited number of suppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with suppliers or that our contingency plans will be effective to prevent disruptions that may arise from shortages or discontinuation of any raw materials and other supplies that we use in the manufacture
 production and distribution of our products. The raw materials and other supplies
 including agricultural commodities and fuel
 that we use for the manufacturing
 production and distribution of our products are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors
 including changes in supply and demand
 weather conditions (including potential effects of climate change)
 fire
 natural disasters
 disease or pests (including the impact of greening disease on the citrus industry)
 agricultural uncertainty
 health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks
 governmental incentives and controls (including import/export restrictions
 such as new or increased tariffs
 sanctions
 quotas or trade barriers)
 political uncertainties
 acts of terrorism
 governmental instability or currency exchange rates. Many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation. If price changes result in unexpected or significant increases in the costs of any raw materials or other supplies
 we may be unwilling or unable to increase our product prices or unable to effectively hedge against price increases to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume
 revenue
Political and social conditions in the markets in which our products are sold have been and could continue to be difficult to predict
 resulting in adverse effects on our business. The results of elections
 referendums or other political conditions (including government shutdowns) in these markets
 including the United Kingdom&#8217;s withdrawal from the European Union
 have in the past and could continue to impact how existing laws
 regulations and government programs or policies are implemented or result in uncertainty as to how such laws
 regulations
 programs or policies may change
 including with respect to tariffs
 sanctions
 environmental and climate change regulations
 taxes
 benefit programs
 the movement of goods
 services and people between countries
 relationships between countries
 customer or consumer perception of a particular country or its government and other matters
 and has resulted in and could continue to result in exchange rate fluctuation
 volatility in global stock markets and global economic uncertainty or adversely affect demand for our products
 any of which can adversely affect our business. In addition
 political and social conditions in certain cities throughout the U.S. as well as globally have resulted in demonstrations and protests
 including in connection with political elections and civil rights and liberties. Our operations
 including the distribution of our products and the ingredients or other raw materials used in the production of our products
 may be disrupted if such events persist for a prolonged period of time
 including due to actions taken by governmental authorities in affected cities and regions
Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emerging markets
 including Mexico
 Russia
 the Middle East
 Brazil
 China
 South Africa and India. There can be no assurance that our products will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market
 due to competition
 price
 cultural differences
 consumer preferences
 method of distribution or otherwise. Our business in these markets has been and could continue in the future to be impacted by economic
 political and social conditions; acts of war
 terrorist acts
 and civil unrest
 including demonstrations and protests; competition; tariffs
certain countries in these markets; foreign ownership restrictions; nationalization of our assets or the assets of our business partners; government-mandated closure
 or threatened closure
 of our operations or the operations of our business partners; restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or substances used in our products; highly inflationary economies; devaluation or fluctuation or demonetization of currency; regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries
 currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions
 which result in significant cash balances in foreign countries
 from time to time
 or can significantly affect our ability to effectively manage our operations in certain of these markets and can result in the deconsolidation of such businesses; the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems; increased costs of doing business due to compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations
 including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 the U.K. Bribery Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act; and adverse consequences
 such as the assessment of fines or penalties
 for any failure to comply with laws and regulations. Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to expand our business in developing and emerging markets
 effectively operate
 or manage the risks associated with operating
 in these markets
Many of the jurisdictions in which our products are sold have experienced and could continue to experience uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions
 such as recessions or economic slowdowns
 which have and could continue to result in adverse changes in interest rates
 tax laws or tax rates; volatile commodity markets; highly inflationary economies
 devaluation
 fluctuation or demonetization; contraction in the availability of credit; demonetization
 austerity or stimulus measures; the effects of any default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of the countries in which our products are sold; or a decrease in the fair value of pension or post-retirement assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/or funding requirements of our pension or post-retirement plans. In addition
 we cannot predict how current or future economic conditions will affect our business partners
 including financial institutions with whom we do business
We depend on information systems and technology
 including public websites and cloud-based services
 for many activities important to our business
 including communications within our company
 interfacing with customers and consumers; ordering and managing inventory; managing and operating our facilities; protecting confidential information; maintaining accurate financial records and complying with regulatory
 financial reporting
 legal and tax requirements. Our business has in the past and could in the future be negatively affected by system shutdowns
 degraded systems performance
 systems disruptions or security incidents. These disruptions or incidents may be caused by cyberattacks and other cyber incidents
 network or power outages
 software
 equipment or telecommunications failures
 the unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors
 natural disasters
 fires or other catastrophic events. Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently
 are constantly evolving in nature
 are becoming more sophisticated and are being carried out by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives. Cyberattacks and cyber incidents take many forms including cyber extortion
 denial of service
 social engineering
 introduction of viruses or malware
 exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware
 software or other infrastructure
 hacking
 website defacement or theft of passwords and other credentials
 unauthorized use of computing resources for digital currency mining and business email compromise. As with other global companies
 we are regularly subject to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents
 including many of the types of attacks and incidents described above. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to continue to build and maintain our information technology infrastructure
we fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents
 our business can be adversely affected
 resulting in transaction errors
 processing inefficiencies
 data loss
 legal claims or proceedings
 regulatory penalties
Similar risks exist with respect to third-party providers
 including cloud-based service providers
 that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions
 including payroll processing
 health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions
 and the systems managed
 hosted
 provided and/or used by such third parties and their vendors. The need to coordinate with various third-party service providers
 including with respect to timely notification and access to personnel and information concerning an incident
 may complicate our efforts to resolve issues that arise. As a result
Although the cyber incidents and other systems disruptions that we have experienced to date have not had a material effect on our business
 such incidents or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on us in the future. While we devote significant resources to network security
 disaster recovery
 employee training and other security measures to protect our systems and data
 there are no assurances that such measures will protect us against all cyber incidents or systems disruptions. In addition
 while we currently maintain insurance coverage that
 subject to its terms and conditions
 is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cyber incidents and information systems failures
 this insurance coverage may not
 depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident
 cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident
We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions
 joint ventures
 distribution agreements
 divestitures
 refranchisings and other strategic transactions. The success of these transactions is dependent upon
 among other things
 our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns
 benefits
 cost savings or synergies as a result of a transaction
 within the anticipated time frame
 or at all; receipt of necessary consents
 clearances and approvals; and diversion of management&#8217;s attention from day-to-day operations. Risks associated with strategic transactions include integrating manufacturing
 distribution
 sales
 accounting
 financial reporting and administrative support activities and information technology systems with our company; operating through new business models or in new categories or territories; motivating
 recruiting and retaining executives and key employees; conforming controls (including internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures) and policies (including with respect to environmental compliance
 health and safety compliance and compliance with anti-bribery laws); retaining existing customers and consumers and attracting new customers and consumers; managing tax costs or inefficiencies; maintaining good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain; managing the impact of business decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners that may have different interests than we do; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities
 such as contingent liabilities and litigation. Strategic transactions that are not successfully completed or managed effectively
 or our failure to effectively manage the risks associated with such transactions
We rely on third-party service providers
 including cloud data service providers
 for certain areas of our business
 including payroll processing
 health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions. Failure by these third parties to meet their contractual
 regulatory and other obligations to us
 or our failure to adequately monitor their performance
continue to result in our inability to achieve the expected cost savings or efficiencies and result in additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers. Depending on the function involved
 such errors can also lead to business disruption
 systems performance degradation
 processing inefficiencies or other systems disruptions
 the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise
 incorrect or adverse effects on financial reporting
 litigation or remediation costs
 damage to our reputation or have a negative impact on employee morale
In addition
 we continue on our multi-year business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systems
 including our financial processing systems
 to enterprise-wide systems solutions. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure
 or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative
Climate change may have a negative effect on agricultural productivity which may result in decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products
 such as potatoes
 sugar cane
 corn
 wheat
 rice
 oats
 oranges and other fruits (and fruit-derived oils). In addition
 climate change may also increase the frequency or severity of natural disasters and other extreme weather conditions
 which could impair our production capabilities
 disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. Also
 concern over climate change may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change
 which could result in significant increased costs and require additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result
 the effects of climate change can negatively affect our business and operations. In addition
 any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to regulatory requirements concerning climate change can lead to adverse publicity
Many of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements
 and other employees may seek to be covered by collective bargaining agreements. Strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions can occur if we are unable to renew
 or enter into new
 collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms and can impair manufacturing and distribution of our products
 lead to a loss of sales
 increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy
Our future growth depends
 in part
 on our ability to continue to reduce costs and improve efficiencies
 including implementing shared business service organizational models. We continue to identify and implement productivity initiatives that we believe will position our business for long-term sustainable growth by allowing us to achieve a lower cost structure
 improve decision-making and operate more efficiently. Some of these measures result in unintended consequences
 such as business disruptions
 distraction of management and employees
 reduced morale and productivity
 unexpected employee attrition
result of these initiatives
 we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits
We conduct impairment tests on our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. In addition
 amortizable intangible assets
 property
 plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. A deterioration in our underlying assumptions regarding the impact of competitive operating conditions
 macroeconomic conditions or other factors used to estimate the future performance of any of our reporting units or assets
 including any deterioration in the weighted-average cost of capital based on market data available at the time
 can result in an impairment
Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars
 the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United States
 where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar
 are translated into U.S. dollars. Given our global operations
 we also pay for the ingredients
 raw materials and commodities used in our business in numerous currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates
 including as a result of currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions have had
 and could continue to have
Rating agencies routinely evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors
 including our cash generating capability
 levels of indebtedness
 policies with respect to shareholder distributions and our financial strength generally
 as well as factors beyond our control
 such as the state of the economy and our industry. We expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access
 which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global credit markets at favorable interest rates. Any downgrade or announcement that we are under review for a potential downgrade of our credit ratings
 especially any downgrade to below investment grade
 can increase our future borrowing costs
 impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all
 result in a reduction in our liquidity
 or impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically (and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing)
Legal
Certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed
 or are considering imposing
 new or increased taxes on the manufacture
 distribution or sale of certain of our products
 particularly our beverages
 as a result of the ingredients or substances contained in our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages
 including non-caloric beverages
 while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g.
 sugar). Similarly
 some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain amount of added sugar (or other sweetener)
 some apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and others apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing any amount of added sugar (or other sweetener). For example
 Poland enacted a graduated tax on all sweetened beverages
 effective January 1
 2021
These tax measures
 whatever their scope or form
of our products
 reduce overall consumption of our products or lead to negative publicity
Certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed
 or are considering imposing
 limitations on the marketing or sale of our products as a result of ingredients or substances in our products. These limitations require that we highlight perceived concerns about a product
 warn consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products
 restrict the age of consumers to whom products are marketed or sold or limit the location in which our products may be available. For example
 Mexico has imposed a stop-sign labeling scheme to signal the presence of non-caloric sweeteners and caffeine in pre-packaged foods and non-alcoholic beverages. Certain jurisdictions have imposed or are considering imposing color-coded labeling requirements where colors such as red
 yellow and green are used to indicate various levels of a particular ingredient
 such as sugar
 sodium or saturated fat
 in products. The imposition or proposed imposition of additional limitations on the marketing or sale of our products has in the past and could continue to reduce overall consumption of our products
 lead to negative publicity or leave consumers with the perception that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs
Certain of our products are sold in plastic or other packaging designed to be recyclable. However
 not all packaging is recycled
 whether due to lack of infrastructure or otherwise
 and certain of our packaging is not currently recyclable. Packaging waste that displays one or more of our brands has in the past resulted in and could continue to result in negative publicity or reduced consumer demand for our products
 adversely affecting our financial performance. Many jurisdictions in which our products are sold have imposed or are considering imposing regulations or policies intended to encourage the use of sustainable packaging
 waste reduction or increased recycling rates or to restrict the sale of products utilizing certain packaging. These regulations vary in form and scope and include taxes to incentivize behavior
 restrictions on certain products and materials
 requirements for bottle caps to be tethered to bottles
 bans on the use of single-use plastics
 extended producer responsibility policies and requirements to charge deposit fees. For example
 the European Union has imposed a minimum recycled content requirement for beverage bottles packaging and similar legislation is under consideration in several states in the United States. These laws and regulations have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of our products
 impact demand for our products
 result in negative publicity and require us and our business partners
 including our independent bottlers
 to increase our capital expenditures to invest in minimizing the amount of plastic or other materials used in our packaging or to develop alternative packaging
We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding personal data protection and privacy laws. These laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country or
 within the United States
 from state to state
 and can create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations
 including with respect to data from residents of the European Union who are covered by the General Data Protection Regulation or residents of the state of California who are covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act
 impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to continue to increase over time. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in litigation
 claims
 legal or regulatory proceedings
 inquiries or investigations or damage to our reputation
Increases in income tax rates
Increases in income tax rates or other changes in tax laws
 including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced
 can adversely affect our financial performance. For example
 economic and political conditions in countries where we are subject to taxes
 including the United States
 have in the past and could continue to result in significant changes in tax legislation or regulation
has in the past and could continue to increase tax uncertainty
 resulting in higher compliance costs and adverse effects on our financial performance. We are also subject to regular reviews
 examinations and audits by numerous taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate
 or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation
 may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals
If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights
 or if we are found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others
We possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business
 including ingredient formulas
 trademarks
 copyrights
 patents
 business processes and other trade secrets. The laws of various jurisdictions in which we operate have differing levels of protection of intellectual property. Our competitive position and the value of our products and brands can be reduced and our business adversely affected if we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property
 including our ingredient formulas
 or if there is a change in law that limits or removes the current legal protections afforded our intellectual property. Also
 if
 in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products
 we are found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others
 directly or indirectly
 such finding can damage our reputation and limit our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products
The conduct of our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the production
 storage
 distribution
 sale
 display
 advertising
 marketing
 labeling
 content (including whether a product contains genetically engineered ingredients)
 quality
 safety
 transportation
 traceability
 packaging
 disposal
 recycling and use of our products
 employment and occupational health and safety
 environmental matters (including pesticide use) and data privacy and protection. In addition
 in many jurisdictions
 compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position
 as is compliance with anti-corruption laws. The imposition of new laws
 changes in laws or regulatory requirements or changing interpretations thereof
 and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products are made
 manufactured
 distributed or sold
 have in the past and could continue to result in higher compliance costs
 capital expenditures and higher production costs
 resulting in adverse effects on our business. In addition
 if one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new laws or regulations that impact the manufacture
 distribution or sale of our products
 other jurisdictions can often follow. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations can subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions
 including fines
 injunctions
 product recalls
 penalties
 disgorgement of profits or activity restrictions
Potential liabilities and costs from litigation
 claims
 legal or regulatory proceedings
We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation
 claims
 legal or regulatory proceedings
 inquiries and investigations
 including but not limited to matters related to our advertising
 marketing or commercial practices
 product labels
 claims and ingredients
 intellectual property rights
 environmental
 privacy
 employment
 tax and insurance matters and matters relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. These matters are inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters and the likely outcome or potential losses and established reserves will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. Responding to these matters
 even those that are ultimately non-meritorious
 requires us to incur significant expense and devote significant resources

 claims
 legal or regulatory proceedings
 inquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty
 management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition

 Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 28
PepsiCo is a leading global food and beverage company with a complementary portfolio of brands
 including Frito-Lay
 Gatorade
 Pepsi-Cola
 Quaker and Tropicana. Through our operations
 authorized bottlers
 contract manufacturers and other third parties
 we make
 market
 distribute and sell a wide variety of convenient beverages
 foods and snacks
Everything we do is driven by an approach we call Winning with Purpose. Winning with Purpose is our guide for achieving accelerated
 sustainable growth that includes our mission
 to Create More Smiles with Every Sip and Every Bite; our vision
 to Be the Global Leader in Convenient Foods and Beverages by Winning with Purpose; and The PepsiCo Way
This approach proved prescient and powerful in 2020 as we faced a worsening climate crisis
 renewed calls for racial equality
 and the first global pandemic in a century. Life in communities around the world was transformed
 and our business was tested like never before. First and foremost
 we had to protect the health of our associates
 so that we could continue to serve our consumers
 customers and communities. At the same time
 we had to secure our supply chain; ensure continuity in manufacturing
 distribution and sales; further strengthen our e-commerce and digital capabilities; reimagine our marketing; deliver positive outcomes for people
These challenges were in addition to the structural issues facing our Company
 including: shifting consumer preferences and behaviors; a highly competitive operating environment; a rapidly changing retail landscape
To meet this once in a generation moment and ensure our Company&#8217;s long-term success
 we will continue to focus on becoming Faster
 Stronger
We will become Faster by sustaining or improving growth and market share in our high return foods and snacks businesses in North America; improving the profitability of our PBNA business and capturing our fair share of category growth; accelerating our growth and presence in international snacks and food while investing wisely in beverages to balance between growth and returns; and making the necessary investments in our manufacturing capacity
 go-to-market systems and digital initiatives
We will become Stronger by renewing our focus on driving holistic cost management throughout our organization to support our investments in advantaged capabilities
 such as a highly agile and flexible end-to-end value chain; more precision around revenue management; and investing in data analytics that can provide more granularity around consumer insights. We also plan to continue investing to further expand global business services into new capabilities
 which will enable better insight and support for our businesses at a lower cost. And we will remain focused on diversifying our workforce and reinforcing The PepsiCo Way
We will become Better by further integrating purpose into our business strategy and brands by becoming planet positive
 strengthening our roots in our communities

 competition and human capital. In addition
Certain members of our Board of Directors also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers. These Board members do not participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations. Our transactions with these vendors and customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers. In addition
Our global operations continue to expose us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic
 countries and territories in which our products are made
 manufactured
 distributed or sold. Travel bans and restrictions
 quarantines
 curfews
 restrictions on public gatherings
 shelter in place and safer-at-home orders
 business shutdowns and closures continue in many of these markets. These measures have impacted and will continue to impact us
 our customers (including foodservice customers)
 consumers
 employees
 bottlers
 contract manufacturers
 distributors
 joint venture partners
 suppliers and other third parties&#160;with whom we do business
 which may result in changes in demand for our products
 increases in operating costs (whether as a result of changes to our supply chain or increases in employee costs
 including expanded benefits and frontline incentives
 costs associated with the provision of personal protective equipment and increased sanitation
 or otherwise)
 or adverse impacts to our supply chain through reduced availability of air or other commercial transport
 port closures or border restrictions
of which can impact our ability to make
 manufacture
 distribute and sell our products. In addition
 measures that impact our ability to access our offices (several of which remain closed)
 plants
 warehouses
 distribution centers or other facilities
 or that impact the ability of our customers (including our foodservice customers)
 consumers
 bottlers
 contract manufacturers
 distributors
 joint venture partners
 suppliers and other third parties to do the same
 may continue to impact the availability or productivity of our and their employees
Public concern regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 has impacted and may continue to impact demand from consumers
 including due to consumers not leaving their homes or leaving their homes less often than they did prior to the start of the pandemic or otherwise shopping for and consuming food and beverage products in a different manner than they historically have or because some of our consumers have lower discretionary income due to unemployment or reduced or limited work as a result of measures taken in response to the pandemic. Even as governmental restrictions are relaxed and economies gradually
 partially
 or fully reopen in certain of these jurisdictions and markets
 the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with the pandemic may continue to affect consumer behavior
 spending levels and shopping and consumption preferences. In addition
 as a result of COVID-19
 certain jurisdictions
 such as certain states in Mexico
 have enacted or are considering enacting new or expanded product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products. Changes in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase demand for our products in one quarter
 resulting in decreased demand for our products in subsequent quarters
 or in a lower-margin sales channel resulting in potentially reduced profit from sales of our products. We continue to see shifts in product and channel preferences as markets move through varying stages of restrictions and re-opening at different times
 including changes in at-home consumption
 in immediate consumption and away-from-home channels
 such as convenience and gas and foodservice. In addition
Any reduced demand for our products or change in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns
 as well as continued economic uncertainty
 can adversely affect our customers&#8217; and business partners&#8217; financial condition
 which can result in bankruptcy filings and/or an inability to pay for our products
 reduced or canceled orders of our products
 continued or additional closing of restaurants
 stores
 entertainment or sports complexes
 schools or other venues in which our products are sold
 or reduced capacity at any of the foregoing
 or our business partners&#8217; inability to supply us with ingredients or other items necessary for us to make
 manufacture
 distribute or sell our products. Such adverse changes in our customers&#8217; or business partners&#8217; financial condition have also resulted and may continue to result in our recording additional charges for our inability to recover or collect any accounts receivable
 owned or leased assets
 including certain foodservice and vending and other equipment
 or prepaid expenses. In addition
 continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us
While we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols
 business continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 to our employees and our business
 the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market
 including the duration and scope of the pandemic
 the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines
 global economic conditions during and after the pandemic
 governmental actions that have been taken
the future
 in response to the pandemic and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic

The CARES&#160;Act was enacted on March 27
 2020 in the United States. The CARES Act and related notices include several significant provisions
 such as delaying certain payroll tax payments
 mandatory transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) and estimated income tax payments. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on our financial results in 2020
We are subject to risks in the normal course of business. During the periods presented in this report
 certain jurisdictions in which our products are made
 manufactured
 distributed or sold operated in a challenging environment
 experiencing unstable economic
 political and social conditions
 civil unrest
 natural disasters
 debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations. We continue to monitor the economic
Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made
 manufactured
 distributed or sold have either imposed
 or are considering imposing
 new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture
 distribution or sale of our products or their packaging
 ingredients or substances contained in
 or attributes of
 our products or their packaging
 commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example
 some taxes apply to all beverages
 including non-caloric beverages
 while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g.
 sugar). In addition
 some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g.
 plastic)
 while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging
We sell a wide variety of beverages
 foods and snacks in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell
 the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used vary by jurisdiction. Because of this
 we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes
 regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take
 and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes
 regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition
 taxes
 regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made
 manufactured
 distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact
 if any
 of such taxes
 regulations or limitations
 including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition
 form and scope of any such taxes
During the fourth quarter of 2017
 the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States.&#160;The related provisional measurement period allowed by the SEC ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be complete
 additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted our recorded amounts after December 29

On May 19
 2019
 a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF)
 effective January 1
 2020.&#160;The enactment of certain provisions of the TRAF resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During 2020
 we recorded a net tax benefit of $72 million related to the adoption of the TRAF in the Swiss Canton of Bern. During 2019
Our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape
 including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications
 including through subscription services
 the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We have seen and expect to continue to see a further shift to e-commerce
 online-to-offline
 and other online purchasing by consumers
 including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities
 such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business

commodity prices
In the normal course of business
 we manage commodity price
 foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies
 including productivity initiatives
 global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies
 including the use of derivatives. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. See &#8220;Item&#160;1A. Risk Factors&#8221; for further discussion of our market risks
Inflationary
Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.1 billion as of December&#160;26
 2020 and December&#160;28
 2019. At the end of 2020
 the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments
 assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price
 would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2020 by $121 million
Our operations outside of the United States generated 42% of our consolidated net revenue in 2020
 with Mexico
 Russia
 Canada
 the United Kingdom
 China and South Africa
 collectively
 comprising approximately 21% of our consolidated net revenue in 2020. As a result
 we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made
 manufactured
 distributed or sold. Additionally
 we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries
 foreign currency purchases
 foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During 2020
 unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 2 percentage points
 primarily due to declines in the Mexican peso
In addition
 volatile economic
 political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made
 manufactured
 distributed or sold
 including in Argentina
 Brazil
 China
 Mexico
 the Middle East
 Russia and Turkey
 and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets
 continue to
 and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may
 result in challenging operating environments. We also continue to monitor the economic and political developments related to the United Kingdom&#8217;s withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit)
 including the effects of the post-Brexit trade deal entered into between the United Kingdom and the European Union in December 2020
 as well as the economic
Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $1.9 billion as of December&#160;26
 2020 and December&#160;28
 2019. At the end of 2020
 we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2020 by $175 million
The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.7 billion as of December&#160;26
 2020 and $2.5 billion as of December&#160;28
Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $3.0 billion as of December&#160;26
 2020 and $5.0 billion as of December&#160;28
Assuming year-end 2020 investment levels and variable rate debt
 a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have decreased our net interest expense in 2020 by $80 million due to higher cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments levels
Physical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions
our historical operating performance and underlying trends
Beverage volume includes volume of concentrate sold to independent bottlers and volume of finished products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks and allied brand products and joint venture trademarks sold by company-owned bottling operations
 including by our noncontrolled affiliates. Concentrate volume sold to independent bottlers is reported in concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE)
 whereas finished beverage product volume is reported in bottler case sales (BCS). Both CSE and BCS convert all beverage volume to an 8-ounce-case metric. Typically
 CSE and BCS are not equal in any given period due to seasonality
 timing of product launches
 product mix
 bottler inventory practices and other factors. While our net revenue is not entirely based on BCS volume due to the independent bottlers in our supply chain
 we believe that BCS is a better measure of the consumption of our beverage products. PBNA

Operating profit increased 2%
 primarily reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings
 partially offset by certain operating cost increases. Additionally
Net revenue and unit volume each increased 10%. The net revenue growth reflects organic volume growth and favorable pricing
 partially offset by unfavorable mix. The unit volume growth was driven by double-digit growth in oatmeal and pancake syrup and mix and high-single-digit growth in ready-to-eat cereals. The COVID-19 pandemic drove an increase in consumer demand
Operating profit grew 23%
 reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings

 a 4-percentage-point impact of lower restructuring and impairment charges
 a 3-percentage-point impact of the prior-year inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges primarily associated with our acquisition of SodaStream International Ltd. (SodaStream) and a 2-percentage-point impact of a gain on an asset sale. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases and a 2-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs due to transaction-related foreign exchange. Additionally
 the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and unfavorable foreign exchange reduced operating profit growth by 6 percentage points and 4 percentage points
Net revenue increased 25%

Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-K adjust for the impact of specified&#160;items and are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions
 including the preparation of our annual operating plan
We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends.&#160;Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; amounts associated with mergers
 acquisitions
 divestitures and other structural changes; pension and retiree medical related items; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws
 rules or regulations
 such as significant tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions
Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition

 we multiply or divide

 our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide

We define organic revenue growth as net revenue growth adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange translation
 as well as the impact from acquisitions
We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending
 plus sales of property
 plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities
 we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such
 we believe investors&#160;should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities
 including debt repayments
Return on invested capital (ROIC) and net ROIC
We define ROIC as net income attributable to PepsiCo plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average debt obligations and quarterly average common shareholders&#8217; equity. Although ROIC is a common financial metric
 numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly
We believe this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. In addition
 we use net ROIC
 excluding items affecting comparability
 to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that we believe are not indicative of our&#160;ongoing performance and reflects how management evaluates our operating results and trends. We define net ROIC
 excluding items affecting comparability
 as ROIC
 adjusted for quarterly average cash
 cash equivalents and short-term investments
 after-tax interest income and items affecting comparability. We believe the calculation of&#160;ROIC and net ROIC

We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions.&#160;These commodity derivatives include agricultural products
 energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling
 general and administrative expenses
 depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.&#160;Therefore
 the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility
The 2019 Productivity Plan
 publicly announced on February 15
 2019
 will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify
 harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems
 including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. In connection with this plan
 we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion
 including cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion. Plan to date through December&#160;26
 2020
 we have incurred pre-tax charges of $797 million
 including cash expenditures of $518 million. In our 2021 financial results
 we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $500 million
 including cash expenditures of approximately $400 million
The 2014 Productivity Plan was completed in 2019. The total plan pre-tax charges and cash expenditures approximated the previously disclosed plan estimates of $1.3 billion and $960 million
In 2020
 we recorded inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges related to our acquisitions of BFY Brands
 Inc. (BFY Brands)
 Rockstar
inventory included in the acquisition-date balance sheets and closing costs
 employee-related costs
 contract termination costs
 changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and other integration costs. Merger and integration charges also include liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa
In 2019
 we recorded inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges primarily related to SodaStream&#8217;s acquired inventory included in acquisition-date balance sheet
 as well as merger and integration charges
In 2020
In 2019
During the fourth quarter of 2017
We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition
 together with our revolving credit facilities
 working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing
 such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing
 will&#160;be adequate to meet our operating
 investing and financing needs
 including with respect to our net capital spending plans. Our primary sources of cash available to fund cash outflows
 such as our anticipated dividend payments
 debt repayments
 payments for acquisitions
 including the contingent consideration related to Rockstar
 and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act
 include cash from operations
 proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt and cash and cash equivalents. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by COVID-19 in 2020 and
 to date
 we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the information currently available to us
 we do not expect the impact of COVID-19 to have a material impact on our liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact COVID-19 may have on our business and financial results. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. The CARES Act and related notices include several significant provisions
 such as delaying certain payroll tax payments
 mandatory transition tax payments under the TCJ Act and estimated income tax payments. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on our financial results in 2020
As of&#160;December&#160;26
 2020

The TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings
 including $18.9 billion held in our consolidated subsidiaries outside the United States as of December 30
 2017. As of December&#160;26
 2020
 our mandatory transition tax liability was $3.2 billion
As part of our evolving market practices
 we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions
 which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days
 which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. Under these agreements
 our suppliers
 at their sole discretion
 may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. Supplier participation in these financing arrangements is voluntary. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage PepsiCo&#8217;s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs
 which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers&#8217; decision to participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers
 including amounts due and scheduled payment terms
accounts payable and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We have been informed by the participating financial institutions that as of December 26
 2020 and December 28
 2019
 $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion
 respectively
Furthermore
 our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales
 which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter. On a continuing basis
 we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results
 including acquisitions
 divestitures
 joint ventures
 dividends
 share repurchases

In 2020
 net cash provided by financing activities was $3.8 billion
 primarily reflecting proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $13.8 billion

In 2019
 net cash used for financing activities was $8.5 billion
 primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $8.3 billion
 payments of long-term debt borrowings of $4.0 billion and debt redemptions of $1.0 billion
We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors
 including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 13
 2018
 we announced the 2018 share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $15.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on July 1
 2018 and will expire on June 30
 2021. In addition
 on February&#160;11
 2021
 we announced a 5% increase in our annualized dividend to $4.30 per share from $4.09 per share
 effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2021. We expect to return a total of approximately $5.9 billion to shareholders in 2021

 which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. However
Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency
 especially any downgrade to below investment grade
 whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control
 could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us
 or at all. In addition
 any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically
 and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing.&#160;See &#8220;Item&#160;1A. Risk Factors

An appreciation of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. These policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties
 including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic
 and as a result
We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage products and food and snack products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers
 which is also when control is transferred. The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However
 our policy for DSD
 including certain chilled products
 is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly
 our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result
 we record reserves
 based on estimates
Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms
 which are established in accordance with local and industry practices
 typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States
 and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally
We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility
 write-off history
 the aging of accounts receivable
 our analysis of customer data
 and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of the global economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic)
Our policy is to provide customers with product when needed. In fact
 our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered. In addition
 DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. For product delivered through other distribution networks
As discussed in &#8220;Our Customers&#8221; in &#8220;Item 1. Business
&#8221; we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives
 discounts
 advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf
 such as payments for in-store displays
 payments to gain distribution of new products
A number of our sales incentives
 such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates
 are based on annual targets
 and accruals are established during the year
 as products are delivered
 for the expected payout
 which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition
See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition and related policies
We sell products under a number of brand names
 many of which were developed by us. Brand development costs are expensed as incurred. We also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions. In a business combination
 the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities
 including brands and other intangible assets
 based on estimated fair values
 with any excess recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions
 including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic
 based on an evaluation of a number of factors
 such as marketplace participants
 product life cycles
 market share
 consumer awareness
 brand history and future expansion expectations
We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If these indefinite-lived brand criteria are not met
 brands are amortized over their expected useful lives
 which generally range from 20 to 40 years. Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors
 including market share
 consumer awareness
 brand history
 future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions
In connection with previous acquisitions
 we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories. In determining the useful life of these franchise rights
 many factors were considered
 including the pre-existing perpetual bottling arrangements
 the indefinite period expected for these franchise rights to contribute to our future cash flows
 as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these franchise rights to us
 including legal
 regulatory
 contractual
 competitive
 economic or other factors. Therefore
Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and
 as a result
 are assessed for impairment at least annually
 using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter
 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment
 first we determine if
 based on qualitative factors
 it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic)
 industry and competitive conditions
 legal and regulatory environment
 historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists
In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill
 estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management&#8217;s strategic business plans
 annual sales growth rates
 perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating
 macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic) to estimate future levels of sales
 operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill
 such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital
Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment
 the asset is written down to its estimated fair value
Our annual tax rate is based on our income
 statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions
 including transfer pricing arrangements
 available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when
 despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable
 we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves
 as well as the related interest
 in light of changing facts and circumstances
 such as the progress of a tax audit
 new tax laws
An estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results
Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As a result
 our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent
 such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return
 and some differences reverse over time
 such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit on our consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if
 based on the available evidence
 it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred
During the fourth quarter of 2017
 the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States.&#160;Among its many provisions
 the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%
 effective January 1
 2018.&#160;We recorded a net tax benefit of $28 million ($0.02 per share) in 2018 related to the TCJ Act. The related provisional measurement period allowed by the SEC ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be complete
 additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted our recorded amounts after December 29
 2018. In 2019
On May 19
 2019
 a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the TRAF
 effective January 1
 2020.&#160;The enactment of certain provisions of the TRAF resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During 2020

In 2020
Our pension plans cover certain employees in the United States and certain international employees. Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings. Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. Generally
 our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts
 which vary based upon years of service
 with retirees contributing the remainder of the cost. In addition
In 2020
In 2020
 we adopted an amendment to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans to freeze benefit accruals for salaried participants
 effective December 31
 2025. Since 2011
 salaried new hires are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan. After the effective date
 all salaried participants will receive an employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution and will have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. As a result of this amendment
 pension benefits pre-tax expense is expected to decrease by approximately $70&#160;million in 2021
In 2020
 we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the transfer of certain participants from Plan A to the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I (Plan I) and to a newly created plan
 the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Hourly Plan (Plan H)
 effective January 1
In 2020
 we adopted an amendment
 effective January 1
 2021
 to enhance the pay credit benefits of certain participants in Plan H. As a result of this amendment
 pension benefits pre-tax expense is expected to increase approximately $45&#160;million in 2021
In 2019
Also in 2019
 certain former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were offered the option of receiving a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant&#8217;s pension benefit. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $53 million ($41 million after-tax or $0.03 per share). Collectively
The determination of pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees earn while working
 as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension and retiree medical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1)&#160;the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost)
 (2)&#160;the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time (interest cost)
 and (3)&#160;other gains and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements
certain employee-related demographic factors
 such as turnover
for pension expense
for retiree medical expense
for pension and retiree medical expense
Certain assumptions reflect our historical experience and management&#8217;s best judgment regarding future expectations. All actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually
 except in the case of an interim remeasurement due to a significant event such as a curtailment or settlement. Due to the significant management judgment involved
At each measurement date
 the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality
See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans&#8217; investment strategy. Although we review our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis
The health care trend rate used to determine our retiree medical plans&#8217; obligation and expense is reviewed annually. Our review is based on our claims experience
 information provided by our health plans and actuaries
 and our knowledge of the health care industry. Our review of the trend rate considers factors such as demographics
 plan design
In 2020
 lump sum distributions exceeded the total of annual service and interest cost and triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in Plan A. In addition

 we expect our total pension and retiree medical expense to decrease in 2021 primarily reflecting the recognition of fixed income gains on plan assets
 the impact of discretionary plan contributions and plan changes
We make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally
 we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently tax deductible. As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements
 we generally fund these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis
In November 2020
Our pension and retiree medical contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors
 such as changes in interest rates

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo
 Inc. and the affiliates that we control. In addition
 we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest
 our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. We do not control these other affiliates
% or less. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions

Raw materials
 direct labor and plant overhead
 as well as purchasing and receiving costs
 costs directly related to production planning
 inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities
 are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving
 storing and delivering finished product
 including merchandising activities

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets
 liabilities
 revenues
 expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in determining
 among other items
 sales incentives accruals
 tax reserves
 share-based compensation
 pension and retiree medical accruals
 amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite-lived brands
 goodwill and other long-lived assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience
 as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances
 such as current economic conditions
 and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. The business and economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision

Our divisions are held accountable for share-based compensation expense and
 therefore
The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no control. Therefore
We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products
 energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling
 general and administrative expenses
 depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore
 the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility

We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage products and food and snack products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers
 which is also when control is transferred. Merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product

 are based on annual targets
 and accruals are established during the year
 as products are delivered
 for the expected payout
 which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition
The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed a year

 do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates. Certain arrangements

Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and
 as a result
 are assessed for impairment at least annually
 using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter
 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment
 first we determine if
 based on qualitative factors
 it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic)
 industry and competitive conditions
 legal and regulatory environment
 historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists
In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill
 an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit
 respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management&#8217;s strategic business plans
 annual sales growth rates
 perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating
 macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic) to estimate future levels of sales
 operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill
 such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital
Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment
 the asset is written down to its estimated fair value

In 2016
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that changes the impairment model used to measure credit losses for most financial assets. Under the new model we are required to estimate expected credit losses over the life of our trade receivables
 certain other receivables and certain other financial instruments. The new model replaced the existing incurred credit loss model and generally results in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2020 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures. On initial recognition
In 2019
 the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance primarily addresses how to (1) recognize a deferred tax liability after we transition to or from the equity method of accounting
 (2) evaluate if a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill is related to a business combination or is a separate transaction
 (3) recognize all of the effects of a change in tax law in the period of enactment

 the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at PBNA exceeded their carrying values. However
 there could be an impairment of the carrying value of PBNA&#8217;s reacquired and acquired franchise rights if future revenues and their contribution to the operating results of PBNA&#8217;s CSD business do not achieve our expected future cash flows or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. We have also analyzed the impact of the macroeconomic conditions in Russia on the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia and have concluded that there are no impairments for the year ended December&#160;26
 2020. However
 there could be an impairment of the carrying value of certain brands in Russia
 including juice and dairy brands
 if there is a deterioration in these conditions
 if future revenues and their contributions to the operating results do not achieve our expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions)
 if there are significant changes in the decisions regarding assets that do not perform consistent with our expectations
 or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. For further information on our policies for indefinite-lived intangible assets

The expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options. It is based on our historical experience with similar grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life. Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life.

Settlement/curtailment loss/(gain) represents the result of actions that effectively eliminate all or a portion of related projected benefit obligations. Settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan due to lump sums or other events exceed the annual service and interest cost. Settlements are recognized when actions are irrevocable and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for projected benefit obligations. Lump sum payouts are generally higher when interest rates are lower. Curtailments are due to events such as plant closures or the sale of a business resulting in a reduction of future service or benefits.

Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction with plan obligations
 an evaluation of market conditions
 tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. This strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are available to meet the plans&#8217; benefit obligations when they become due. Assets contributed to our pension plans are no longer controlled by us
 but become the property of our individual pension plans. However
 we are indirectly impacted by changes in these plan assets as compared to changes in our projected obligations. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return expectations. Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments
 such as futures and forward contracts
For 2021 and 2020

The expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset class
reasonableness of the long-term rates. We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure that they are reasonable. To calculate the expected return on plan assets
 our market-related value of assets for fixed income is the actual fair value. For all other asset categories
 such as equity securities
Plan assets measured at fair value as of year-end 2020 and 2019 are categorized consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets)

In the normal course of business
 we manage commodity price
 foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies
 including productivity initiatives
 global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies
Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and
 in the case of our net investment hedges
 debt instruments. Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment
 while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings. The accounting for qualifying hedges allows changes in a hedging instrument&#8217;s fair value to offset corresponding changes in the hedged item in the same reporting period that the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to our income statement when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur
 we immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; such gains or losses reclassified during the year ended December 26
Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price

Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody&#8217;s Investors Service

We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders
 pricing agreements and derivative instruments
 which primarily include swaps and futures. In addition
 risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives
 with terms of no more than

In our opinion
 the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the Company as of December&#160;26

 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December&#160;26

 the Company maintained
 in all material respects
 effective internal control over financial reporting as of December&#160;26

As permitted by SEC guidance
 the scope of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 26
 2020 excluded Pioneer Food Group Ltd. and its subsidiaries (Pioneer Foods) and Hangzhou Haomusi Food Co.
 Ltd. and its subsidiaries (Be &amp; Cheery)
 both of which the Company acquired in 2020. Pioneer Foods&#8217; total assets and net revenue represented approximately 2.2% and 1.4%
 respectively
 of the consolidated total assets and net revenue of the Company as of and for the year ended December 26
 2020. Be &amp; Cheery&#8217;s total assets and net revenue represented approximately 1.1% and 0.4%
 respectively
 of the consolidated total assets and net revenue of the Company as of and for the year ended December 26
The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements
 for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
 and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error or fraud
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements
 whether due to error or fraud
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
 assessing the risk that a material weakness exists
A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging
 subjective
 or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements
 taken as a whole
 and we are not
 by communicating the critical audit matters below
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements
 the Company offers sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. A number of the sales incentives are based on annual targets
 resulting in the need to accrue for the expected liability. These incentives are accrued for in the &#8220;Accounts payable and other current liabilities&#8221; line on the balance sheet. These accruals are based on sales incentive agreements
 expectations regarding customer and consumer participation and performance levels
and performance level assumptions underlying the accrual
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the Company&#8217;s sales incentive process
 including (1) the accrual methodology
 (2) assumptions around forecasted customer and consumer participation
 (3) performance levels
 and (4) monitoring of actual sales incentives incurred compared to estimated sales incentives in respect of historical periods. To evaluate the timing and amount of certain accrued sales incentives we (1) analyzed the accrual by sales incentive type as compared to historical trends to identify specific sales incentives that may require additional testing
 (2) recalculated expenses and closing accruals on a sample basis
 based on volumes sold and terms of the sales incentives
 (3) assessed the Company&#8217;s ability to accurately estimate its sales incentive accrual by comparing previously established accruals to actual settlements
 and (4) tested a sample of settlements or claims that occurred after period end
As discussed in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements
 the Company performs impairment testing of its indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis during the third quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that there is a greater than 50% likelihood that the asset is impaired. The carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December&#160;26
 2020 was $36.4 billion which represents 39% of total assets
 and includes PepsiCo Beverages North America&#8217;s (PBNA) reacquired and acquired franchise rights which had a carrying value of $8.6 billion as of December&#160;26
We identified the assessment of the carrying value of PBNA&#8217;s reacquired and acquired franchise rights and certain of Europe&#8217;s juice and dairy brands in Russia as a critical audit matter. Significant auditor judgment is necessary to assess the impact of competitive operating and macroeconomic factors on future levels of sales
 operating profit and cash flows. The impairment analysis of these indefinite-lived intangible assets requires significant auditor judgment to evaluate the Company&#8217;s forecasted revenue and profitability levels
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the Company&#8217;s indefinite-lived assets impairment process to develop the forecasted revenue
 profitability levels
 and expected long-term growth rates and select the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows. We also evaluated the sensitivity of the Company&#8217;s conclusion to changes in assumptions
 including the assessment of changes in assumptions from prior periods. To assess the Company&#8217;s ability to accurately forecast
 we compared the Company&#8217;s historical forecasted results to actual results. We compared the cash flow projections used in the impairment tests with available external industry data and other internal information. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating (1) the long-term growth rates used in the impairment tests by comparing against economic data and information specific to the respective assets
 including projected long-term nominal Gross Domestic Product growth in the respective local countries
 and (2) the discount rates used in the impairment tests by comparing them against discount rates that were independently developed using publicly available market data
As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements
 the Company&#8217;s global operating model gives rise to income tax obligations in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. As of December&#160;26
 2020
 the Company recorded reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.6 billion. The Company establishes reserves if it believes that certain positions taken in its tax returns are subject to challenge and the Company likely will not succeed
 even though the Company believes the tax return position is supportable under the tax law. The Company adjusts these reserves
 as well as the related interest
 in light of new information
 such as the progress of a tax examination
 new tax law
We identified the evaluation of the Company&#8217;s unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because the application of tax law and interpretation of a tax authority&#8217;s settlement history is complex and involves subjective judgment. Such judgments impact both the timing and amount of the reserves that are recognized
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the Company&#8217;s unrecognized tax benefits process
 including controls to (1) identify uncertain income tax positions
 (2) evaluate the tax law and tax authority&#8217;s settlement history used to estimate the unrecognized tax benefits
 and (3) monitor for new information that may give rise to changes to the existing unrecognized tax benefits
 such as progress of a tax examination
 new tax law or tax authority settlements. We involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge
 who assisted in assessing the unrecognized tax benefits by (1) evaluating the Company&#8217;s tax structure and transactions
 including transfer pricing arrangements
 and (2) assessing the Company&#8217;s interpretation of existing tax law as well as new and amended tax laws
 tax positions taken
 associated external counsel opinions
 information from tax examinations

 we carried out an evaluation
 under the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

 as appropriate
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
 as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management

 (2013) by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation
 our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December&#160;26

 respectively
 of the consolidated total assets and net revenue of PepsiCo
 Inc. as of and for the year ended December 26
 2020. Be &amp; Cheery&#8217;s total assets and net revenue represented approximately 1.1% and 0.4%

 Except as discussed
 there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth quarter of 2020 that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
During our fourth quarter of 2020
 we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide systems solution. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative
 and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses. In addition
 in connection with our 2019 multi-year productivity plan
to migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify
 harmonize and automate processes. In connection with these implementations and resulting business process changes
 we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These transitions have not materially affected
 and we do not expect them to materially affect

. We may
 without the consent of the existing holders of the notes of a series
 issue additional notes of such series having the same terms (except issue date
 date from which interest accrues and
 in some cases
 the first interest payment date) so that the existing notes of such series and the new notes of such series form a single series under the indenture. As of February 4
 2021
. The sterling notes were issued in minimum denominations of &#163;100
000 and integral multiples of &#163;1
000 in excess thereof. The euro notes were issued in minimum denominations of &#8364;100
000 and integral multiples of &#8364;1

 or its successor
 as operator of the Euroclear System (&#8220;Euroclear&#8221;) and Clearstream Banking
. We have initially appointed The Bank of New York Mellon
 London Branch to act as paying agent and transfer agent in connection with the notes as well as to serve as the common depositary for the notes. The Bank of New York Mellon
 London Branch is an affiliate of the trustee. The term &#8220;paying agent&#8221; shall include The Bank of New York Mellon
. The principal and interest payments in respect of the sterling notes are payable in sterling. If the United Kingdom adopts euro
 in lieu of sterling
 as its lawful currency
 the sterling notes will be redenominated in euro on a date determined by us
 in our sole discretion
 with a principal amount for each sterling note equal to the principal amount of that note in sterling
 converted into euro at the rate established by the applicable law&#894; provided that
 if we determine after consultation with the paying agent that the then current market practice in respect of redenomination into euro of internationally offered securities is different from the provisions specified above
agent of such deemed amendment. We will give 30 days&#8217; notice of the redenomination date to the paying agent
 the trustee
If sterling or
 in the event the sterling notes are redenominated in euro
 euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control (other than
 with respect to sterling
 due to the circumstances described in the preceding paragraph but including the dissolution of the euro
 if applicable)
 then all payments in respect of the sterling notes will be made in U.S. dollars until sterling or euro
 as the case may be
 is again available to us. The amount payable on any date in sterling or
 in the event the sterling notes are redenominated in euro
 euro will be converted to U.S. dollars on the basis of the then most recently available market exchange rate for sterling or euro
 as the case may be
 as determined by us in our sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the sterling notes so made in euro or U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under the sterling notes or the indenture governing the sterling notes. Neither the trustee nor the paying agent shall be responsible for obtaining exchange rates
The principal and interest payments in respect of the euro notes
 including payments made upon any redemption of any series of the euro notes
 are payable in euro.

After a declaration of acceleration
 the holders of not less than 51% in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes of any series may rescind this accelerated payment requirement if all existing Events of Default
 except for nonpayment of the principal and interest on the notes of that series that has become due solely as a result of the accelerated payment requirement
 have been cured or waived and if the rescission of acceleration would not conflict with any judgment or decree. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of any series also have the right to waive past defaults
 except a default in paying principal
 premium or interest on any outstanding note
Holders of at least 51% in principal amount of the outstanding notes of a series may seek to institute a proceeding only after they have notified the trustee of a continuing Event of Default in writing and made a written request
 and offered reasonable indemnity
 to the trustee to institute a proceeding and the trustee has failed to do so within 60 days after it received this notice. In addition
 within this 60 day period the trustee must not have received directions inconsistent with this written request by holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of that series. These limitations do not apply
 however
enforcement of the payment of principal
During the existence of an Event of Default
 the trustee is required to exercise the rights and powers vested in it under the indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise as a prudent man would under the circumstances in the conduct of that person&#8217;s own affairs. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
 the trustee is not under any obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers at the request or direction of any of the holders unless the holders have offered to the trustee reasonable security or indemnity. Subject to certain provisions
 the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of any series have the right to direct the time
 method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee
 or exercising any trust
The trustee will
 within 90 days after any default occurs
 give notice of the default to the holders of the notes of that series
 unless the default was already cured or waived. Unless there is a default in paying principal
 interest or any premium when due

Other amendments and modifications of the indenture or the notes issued may be made with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes of each series affected by the amendment or modification. However
 no modification or amendment may

In addition
 we may elect to have our obligations released with respect to certain covenants in the indenture (&#8220;covenant defeasance&#8221;). Any omission to comply with these obligations will not constitute a default or an event of default with respect to the notes of any series. In the event covenant defeasance occurs
 certain events
 not including non-payment
 bankruptcy and insolvency events
&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;we must irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the trustee as trust funds for the purpose of making the following payments

 all of the principal (including mandatory sinking fund payments)
&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;in the case of legal defeasance
 we must have delivered to the trustee an opinion of counsel stating that
 under then applicable federal income tax law
 the holders of the notes of that series will not recognize income

 we must have delivered to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the holders of the notes of that series will not recognize income
&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;no event of default or default with respect to the outstanding notes of that series has occurred and is continuing at the time of such deposit after giving effect to the deposit or
 in the case of legal defeasance
 no default relating to bankruptcy or insolvency has occurred and is continuing at any time on or before the 91st&#160;day after the date of such deposit
&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance will not cause the trustee to have a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act

 or constitute a default under
&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance will not result in the trust arising from such deposit constituting an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940

Book-Entry
We have obtained the information in this section concerning Clearstream and Euroclear and their book-entry systems and procedures from sources that we believe to be reliable. We take no responsibility for an accurate portrayal of this information. In addition
The notes of each series were initially represented by one or more fully registered global notes. Each such global note was deposited with
 or on behalf of
 a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Clearstream and Euroclear. Except as set forth below
 the global notes may be transferred
 in whole and not in part
 only to Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective nominees. You may hold your interests in the global notes in Europe through Clearstream or Euroclear
 either as a participant in such systems or indirectly through organizations which are participants in such systems. Clearstream and Euroclear will hold interests in the global notes on behalf of their respective participating organizations or customers through customers&#8217; securities accounts in Clearstream&#8217;s or Euroclear&#8217;s names on the books of their respective depositaries. Book-entry interests in the notes and all transfers relating to the notes will be reflected in the book-entry records of Clearstream and Euroclear. The address of Clearstream is 42 Avenue JF Kennedy
 L-1855 Luxembourg
 Luxembourg and the address of Euroclear is 1 Boulevard Roi Albert II
 B-1210 Brussels
the notes will receive payments relating to their notes in sterling with respect to the sterling notes and euro with respect to the euro notes
Clearstream and Euroclear have established electronic securities and payment transfer
 processing
 depositary and custodial links among themselves and others
 either directly or through custodians and depositaries. These links allow the notes to be issued
The policies of Clearstream and Euroclear govern payments
 transfers
Except as provided otherwise
 owners of beneficial interests in the notes will not be entitled to have the notes registered in their names
 will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of the notes in definitive form and will not be considered the owners or holders of the notes under the indenture
 including for purposes of receiving any reports delivered by us or the trustee pursuant to the indenture. Accordingly
 each person owning a beneficial interest in a note must rely on the procedures of the depositary and
 if such person is not a participant
 on the procedures of the participant through which such person owns its interest
. Subject to certain conditions
 the notes represented by the global notes are exchangeable for certificated notes in definitive form of like tenor in minimum denominations of &#163;100
000 principal amount and integral multiples of &#163;1
000 in excess thereof with respect to the sterling notes and &#8364;100
000 principal amount and integral multiples of &#8364;1
(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the common depositary provides notification that it is unwilling
Any note of any series that is exchangeable as above is exchangeable for certificated notes of such series issuable in authorized denominations and registered in such names as the common depositary shall direct. Subject to the foregoing
 a global note is not exchangeable
. Payments (including principal
 interest and any additional amounts) and transfers with respect to notes of any series in certificated form may be executed at the office or agency maintained for such purpose within the City of London (initially the office of the paying agent maintained for such purpose) or
 at our option
 by check mailed to the holders thereof at the respective addresses set forth in the register of holders of the applicable notes of such series
 provided that all payments (including principal
 interest and any additional amounts) on notes in certificated form
 for which the holders thereof have given wire transfer instructions
 will be required to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders thereof. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer
 but payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge payable in connection with that registration may be required.

Taxes
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Plan came into operation on and took effect from September 1
 1980
 and was comprised of the &#8220;PepsiCo International Retirement Plan Trust Indenture&#8221; and the &#8220;Plan Rules&#8221;
 and was later amended and restated in its entirety
 effective September 2
The Plan was further amended and restated in its entirety
 effective October 1
 2003
The Plan was further amended effective January 1
 2005
 so that no person subject to taxation in the United States of America may in any way have their right to a benefit from the Plan come into existence
 increase or in any way be enhanced
Effective January 1
 2010
 the Plan A Rules and Plan B Rules were amended and restated in their entirety to form a single governing legal document
 as set forth herein.  The terms of the Plan set forth in this amended and restated governing legal document are known as the &#8220;DB Program&#8221; (also known as &#8220;PIRP-DB&#8221;).  This amended and restated governing legal document shall apply to Members who are in Membership from and after January 1
 2010
 as well as any others who claim rights from and after January 1
 2010 that are derived from current or former Membership
 including former Members and the Dependants and Eligible Spouses of Members and former Members.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan
 the amendment and restatement of this Plan
 the supersession of the prior documents by this Plan
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Effective January 1
 2011
 the Corporation established a new defined contribution structure (the &#8220;DC Program&#8221;) to benefit selected international employees for whom it has been determined to be appropriate (i.e.
 employees on assignments outside of their home countries for whom it is judged to be impracticable to have them participate in their home country retirement plans and employees who are among a selected group of senior globalists on United States tax equalized packages).  The terms of the DC Program are set forth in a separate governing legal document.  Together
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The DB Program was previously amended and restated
 effective  January 1
 2016. The DB Program was again amended and restated
 effective January 1
 2019.  The DB Program is hereby amended and restated effective January 1
 2021 (the &#8220;Restatement Date&#8221;) to freeze the DB Program effective as of the end of the day on December 31
 2025.  As a result
 effective on and after January 1
 2026
 all accruals under the DB Program
 as well as all Pensionable Service
Salary and other compensation that are recognized under the Plan
 are treated as ending no later than at the end of the day on December 31
 2025
 and where the DB Program requires that Salary or other compensation be averaged over a period of service
 service after December 31
 2025 is not taken into account.  Notwithstanding the foregoing
 in accordance with the DB Program&#8217;s usual rules that would apply in the absence of the DB Program freeze
 a Member shall continue to earn Service (for purposes of determining whether the Member has a vested right to a Pension) and entitlement Service (for purposes of applying more favorable early retirement factors under the DB Program) and shall be permitted to meet any related age threshold relevant to qualify for such early retirement factors while still an Employee
 even after December 31
 2025.  In addition
 the portion of the formula that requires projecting and prorating a Member&#8217;s benefit
 the denominator of the applicable fraction is projected to include service after December 31
 2025 as if the DB Program were not going to freeze while the numerator of the fraction is calculated taking into account the December 31
 2025 freeze
 and then the resulting fraction is frozen as of December 31
 2025&#59; a Member shall continue to earn Service and shall be permitted to meet any related age threshold while still an Employee that would result in the inapplicability of the projecting and prorating formula even after December 31
At all times
 the Plan is unfunded and unsecured for purposes of the United States Internal Revenue Code and Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
 as amended (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;).  The benefits of an executive are an obligation of that executive&#8217;s individual employer.  With respect to his employer

 the Active Member shall automatically have special vesting apply as of the last business day before the earlier of &#8211; (a) the Active Member&#8217;s Approved Transfer
.  Also notwithstanding Section 4.06 above
 in the case of an Active Member who will have a Status Change
 the Active Member may request that the Vice President apply special vesting to him as of the last business day before the Active Member&#8217;s Status Change.  In order for special vesting related to a Status Change to be valid and effective under the DB Program
Subject to the next sentence
 the effect of special vesting applying to a Member in accordance with either subsection (a) or (b) above is that the Member will become vested
 to the same extent as could apply under Section 4.06 if the Member vested under that Section
 as of the date that the special vesting applies.  Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 4.07
 rights under this Section 4.07 are subject to the overriding requirement that benefits and other rights under the Plan must remain entirely exempt from Section 409A of the United States Internal Revenue Code

 1990
&#58;  Subject to Section 5.04
 a Member may elect to receive a reduced Pension payable monthly for his lifetime but for not less than 120 months.  If the Member dies before 120 payments have been made
 the monthly Pension amount shall be paid for the remainder of the 120-month period to the Member's primary Dependant (if the primary Dependant has predeceased the Member
 to the Member's contingent Dependant&#59; and if there is no contingent Dependant
 to the Member&#8217;s estate).  If post-death payments commence to a Member&#8217;s primary or contingent Dependant and such Dependant dies before all remaining payments due have been made
 then the remaining payments shall be paid to such Dependant&#8217;s estate.  Effective as of January 1
 2010
 the Member&#8217;s Dependant or estate (as applicable) may elect by following the procedures set forth by the Vice President for this purpose
 instead to receive a single lump sum payment that is the actuarial equivalent of the remaining payments due to such Dependant or estate (but computed without reduction for mortality)

 if such election meets all requirements to be effective (other than the Member&#8217;s survival
 but including the time for making the election and any necessary Eligible Spouse&#8217;s consent)
 and thereafter the Member dies after leaving employment but before such Pension becomes payable
 then on the first day of the month next following his death such optional form of payment shall be deemed to be in effect.  Such deemed effectiveness may only apply once and only to the initial election made by a Member (except as permitted by a decision of the Vice President that is made prior to the Member&#8217;s submission of a subsequent purported election).

. Where the total Pension payable to any person under the DB Program is
 in the opinion of the Vice President
 of an amount that is relatively trivial (when considered by itself or in relation to the potential administrative burden of continuing to keep track of such Pension under the DB Program)
 he may commute the whole of such Pension to a lump sum payable following (i) the relevant Member&#8217;s termination of employment from both his Employer and the PepsiCo Organization
  or (ii) a Member&#8217;s transfer within the PepsiCo Organization that results in the Member ceasing to actively accrue all benefits under the DB Program
 on a date determined in the discretion of the Vice President
.  Effective January 1
 2019
 the Vice President shall have the discretion to make a lump-sum payment to any Member whose benefit payments have commenced (in a form other than a lump-sum)

000 on the payment date. The amount of the lump sum payment shall be the actuarial equivalent of the Member&#8217;s remaining stream of payments
A Member who has elected to receive all or part of his pension in a form of payment that includes a survivor option shall designate a Dependant who will be entitled to any amounts payable on his death.  A Member shall have the right to change or revoke his Dependant designation at any time prior to the effective date of his election.  If the Member is married at the time he designates a Dependant
 any designation under this section of a Dependant who is not the Member&#8217;s Eligible Spouse shall require the written consent of the Member&#8217;s Eligible Spouse.  A revocation of a Dependant does not require consent by the Member&#8217;s Eligible Spouse.  The designation of any Dependant
 and any change or revocation thereof
 and any written consent of a Member&#8217;s Eligible Spouse required by this Section shall be made in accordance with rules adopted by the Vice President

 who is vested under Section 4.06 or Section 4.07 and who has not yet commenced or received the Member&#8217;s Pension
 if such Member is survived by an Eligible Spouse or an Eligible Domestic Partner and is not entitled at the time of death to the protections provided by Section 5.03(e)
 there shall be payable a Pre-Retirement Spouse&#8217;s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner&#8217;s Pension (as applicable)
 which shall be calculated based on the Member&#8217;s Salary and Pensionable Service as of the earlier of the Member&#8217;s death or termination of employment.  The benefit shall be calculated as if the Member lived until the earliest date the Member&#8217;s vested benefit could have started
 after having elected to start his benefit at that time in the form of a 50 Percent Survivor Annuity
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Coverage for this Pre-Retirement Spouse&#8217;s Pension or Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner&#8217;s Pension shall be paid for with a reduction to the monthly benefit otherwise payable to the Member. The reduction charged to the Member&#8217;s benefit shall be calculated in accordance with the methodology

 the Vice President is to be accorded the maximum discretion possible.  Any exercise of this discretionary authority shall be reviewed by a court
 arbitrator or other tribunal under the arbitrary and capricious standard (
 the abuse of discretion standard).  If

intent of the Plan that no Member who is a U.S. Person may in any way have their benefit from the Plan vest
 increase or in any way be enhanced (collectively
 a &#8220;Benefit Enhancement&#8221;) as a result of their compensation or service while a U.S. Person.  Accordingly
 no Member shall become entitled to a Benefit Enhancement with respect to a calendar year until it is determined
 following the close of such year
 that the Member was not a U.S. Person with respect to such year.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence
 in the calendar year a Member&#8217;s benefit under this Plan is scheduled to commence
 the Vice President may authorize a Benefit Enhancement for the calendar year of benefit commencement to the extent the Vice President determines satisfactorily that the Member will not be a U.S. Person for such year.  In other cases
 the Member&#8217;s benefit will commence under this Plan without any Benefit Enhancement related to the calendar year of commencement
 and appropriate adjustments will be made to the Member&#8217;s benefit in the following year if it is determined that the Member was not a U.S. Person in such calendar year of commencement.    This Section 9.14 shall at all times be interpreted and applied in accordance with the overriding requirement that benefits and any other rights under the Plan must remain entirely exempt from Section 409A

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This section sets forth the formulas for calculating the Pension payable to a Member under Article IV or the Death Benefit payable to a Member&#8217;s Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner
 as applicable
 under Article VI
 but subject in all cases to the freeze of the Plan described in Article I.  Any benefits accrued under the DB Program by a Member while a part-time employee
 following such Member&#8217;s designation by the Vice President as an Eligible Employee pursuant to the last sentence of the definition of Eligible Employee in Section 2.01
(a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Pension payable (as a Single Life Annuity benefit) on retirement at Normal Retirement Date for Members who became members of the Plan before January 1
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;3 percent of the Member&#8217;s Highest Average Monthly Salary
(b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Pension payable (as a Single Life Annuity benefit) on retirement at Normal Retirement Date (i) for Members who became members of the Plan on or after January 1
 1976
 and (ii) for persons (other than those in (i)) who became Members on or after September 1
 1980
 and (iii) for persons (other than in (i) or (ii)) who became Members after November 12
 1998
(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For up to the first 10 years of Pensionable Service
 the product of (i) 3 percent of the Member&#8217;s Highest Average Monthly Salary
 multiplied by (ii) the number of years of Pensionable Service
(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For any years of Pensionable Service in excess of 10
 the product of (i) 1 percent of the Member&#8217;s Highest Average Monthly Salary
(c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the discretion of the Vice President
(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The annuity equivalent of a like portion of all capital sum benefits receivable by the Member on or by reason of his retirement either from a state source or from the Employer in consequence of a requirement of local legislation

(4)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Any other payment made by the Employer at the time of termination of the Member that arises from any severance agreement made between the Employer and Member
(6)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Any deductions
 reductions or forfeiture of a Member's benefits resulting from a Member's misdemeanor
(d)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the Pension payable to or on behalf of a Member is reduced under paragraph (c) above
 an alternative calculation of the Pension for such Member shall apply unless the Vice President determines that the alternative calculation would be unnecessary or impractical or would not serve the purposes of the DB Program.  Under this alternative calculation
 only the Member&#8217;s Pensionable Service under this DB Program
 which does not include any employment that is taken into account in determining benefits under paragraph (c)(1) - (5)
 shall be considered
 and the reductions under paragraph (c)(1) - (5) shall be disregarded (however
 the reduction under paragraph (c)(6) shall be taken into account).  If this alternative calculation applies
 the Pension payable under this alternative calculation shall be compared to the Pension payable under paragraphs (a)
 (b) and (c) above
 and whichever provides the greater Pension amount will be payable to or on behalf of the Member
paragraph (d).  The alternative calculation set forth in this paragraph (d) is intended to provide a calculation methodology that replicates the effect of the &#8220;extended wearaway&#8221; calculation methodology
 as it is in effect from time to time under the PepsiCo Salaried Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of this paragraph (d)
(e)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For purposes of this Table A
 &#34;Highest Average Monthly Salary&#34; means one twelfth of the yearly average of the Member&#8217;s Salary over any 5 consecutive calendar years of Service in which such Salary was highest (or over such lesser period as the Member has been in Service).  For purposes of determining a Member's Highest Average Monthly Salary
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A calendar year with no Salary shall be disregarded
(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If in a calendar year there is an unpaid authorised leave of absence
 or other absence from paid service
 that results in less than a complete year of Salary
(f)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In determining the amount of a Deferred Vested Pension for the purposes of Section 4.04
 the Pension shall be equal to the greatest of the amounts determined under subsection (1)

 the Employer shall allocate Pay Credits and Interest Credits to a Member&#8217;s PIRP-DC Account
.  To receive a Pay Credit for a Plan Year

 any Interest Credit as otherwise available and determined under subsection (b) above shall be prorated for such period based upon the Member&#8217;s fractional year of Membership (
 as may apply in the Member&#8217;s last year of Membership).  A fractional year shall be computed by dividing the Member&#8217;s days of Membership or Active Membership (as applicable) during the Plan Year by the total number of days in such Plan Year.  A period of paid leave of absence during a Plan Year shall be considered a period of Active Membership for purposes of determining a Member&#8217;s Pay Credit for the Plan Year in accordance with the prior sentence.

 the Pay Credit for the Plan Year containing the unpaid leave shall be prorated

(b)  Any termination indemnity or other payment to the Member by the Employer or PepsiCo Organization related to the Member&#8217;s termination of employment
Consistent with the foregoing
 appropriate reductions may be made in the Pay Credits and Interest Credits that otherwise would be provided to the Member under Sections 4.01 and 4.02
 the balance in the Member&#8217;s PIRP-DC Account under Article V
Pay Credits and Interest Credits shall be credited to a Member&#8217;s PIRP-DC Account as of the Valuation Date to which such credits relate (or
 in the case of Pay Credits and Interest Credits that relate to the Member&#8217;s final year of Membership
 as of the Member&#8217;s Distribution Valuation Date) or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter.  A Member&#8217;s PIRP-DC Account is a bookkeeping device to track the notional value of the Member&#8217;s Pay Credits and Interest Credits (and his Employer&#8217;s liability for such credits).  No assets shall be reserved or segregated in connection with any PIRP-DC Account
 and no PIRP-DC Account shall be funded
Subject to Sections 4.02 and 9.14
 a Member shall be fully vested in
 and have a nonforfeitable right to
 his PIRP-DC Account upon completing 3 years of Service
 or if earlier
  Notwithstanding Section 5.02 above
 in the case of an Active Member who will have an Approved Transfer during a Plan Year
 the Active Member shall automatically have special vesting apply as of the last business day before the earlier of &#8211; (a) the Active Member&#8217;s Approved Transfer
.  Also notwithstanding Section 5.02 above
 in the case of an Active Member who will have a Status Change
 the Active Member may request that the Vice President apply special vesting to him as of the last business day before the Active Member&#8217;s Status Change.  In order for special vesting related to a Status Change to be valid and effective under the DC Program
Subject to the next sentence
 the effect of special vesting applying to a Member in accordance with either subsection (a) or (b) above is that the Member will become vested
 to the same extent as could apply under Section 5.02 if the Member vested under that Section
 as of the date that the special vesting applies.  Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 5.03
 rights under this Section 5.03 are subject to the overriding requirement that allocations
other rights under the Plan must remain entirely exempt from Section 409A of the United States Internal Revenue Code
A Member&#8217;s PIRP-DC Account shall be distributed based upon first to occur of the Member&#8217;s termination of employment with the PepsiCo Organization or death
 as provided in Sections 6.02 and 6.03 respectively
If a Member&#8217;s PIRP-DC Account becomes distributable based upon his termination of employment with the PepsiCo Organization
 such distribution shall be made in a single lump sum payment on the first of the month that immediately follows the Member&#8217;s Distribution Valuation Date.  In the case of a Member whose termination of employment with the PepsiCo Organization occurs as a result of the Member becoming disabled
 for purposes of this Section
If a Member&#8217;s PIRP-DC Account becomes distributable based upon his death
 such distribution shall be made in a single lump sum payment on the first day of the month that immediately follows the Member&#8217;s Distribution Valuation Date.  Amounts paid following a Member&#8217;s death shall be paid to the Member&#8217;s Dependant&#59; provided
 however
 that if no Dependant designation is in effect at the time of the Member&#8217;s death (as determined by the Vice President)
 or if all persons designated as Dependants have predeceased the Member
 then the payments to be made pursuant to this Section shall be distributed to the Member&#8217;s Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner
 as applicable
 or
 if the Member does not have an Eligible Spouse or an Eligible Domestic Partner at the time of his death
In determining the amount of any individual distribution pursuant to this Article
A Member shall designate one or more Dependants who will be entitled to any amounts payable on his death.  A Member shall have the right to change or revoke his Dependant designation at any time prior to the effective date of such election.  If the Member is married at the time he or she designates a Dependant(s)
Member&#8217;s Eligible Spouse.  The designation of any Dependant(s)
 and any change or revocation thereof
 and any written consent of a Member&#8217;s Eligible Spouse required by this Section shall be made in accordance with rules adopted by the Vice President
 shall be made in writing on forms provided by the Vice President
  The Plan shall be administered by the Vice President
 who shall have the authority to interpret the Plan and issue such regulations as he deems appropriate. All actions by the Vice President hereunder may be taken in his sole discretion
 and all interpretations
 The Vice President may delegate any of his responsibilities under the Plan to other persons or entities
 or designate or employ other persons to carry out any of his duties
 responsibilities or other functions under the Plan.  Any reference in the Plan to an action by the Vice President shall
 to the extent applicable
Whenever
 in the opinion of the Vice President
 a person entitled to receive any payment of a benefit hereunder is under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his financial affairs
 the Vice President may direct that payments from the Plan be made to such person&#8217;s legal representative for his benefit
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Vice President shall have the exclusive discretionary authority to construe and to interpret the Plan
 to decide all questions of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amount of such benefits
 and his decisions on such matters are final and conclusive.  As a result
 benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Vice President decides in his discretion that the person claiming such benefits is entitled to them.  This discretionary authority is intended to be absolute
 and in any case where the extent of this discretion is in question
 the Vice President is to be accorded the maximum discretion possible.  Any exercise of this discretionary authority shall be reviewed by a court
 arbitrator or other tribunal under the arbitrary and capricious standard (
 the abuse of discretion standard).  If
 pursuant to this discretionary authority
 an assertion of any right to a benefit by or on behalf of a Member or Dependant (a &#8220;claimant&#8221;) is wholly or partially denied
 the Vice President
 or a party designated by the Vice President
 will provide such claimant within the 90-day period following the receipt of the claim by the Vice President
If the Vice President determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim he may extend the response period from 90 to 180 days.  If this occurs
 the Vice President will notify the claimant before the end of the initial 90-day period
 indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Vice President expects to make the final decision.  Upon review
 the Vice President shall provide the claimant a full and fair review of the claim
 including the opportunity to submit to the Vice President comments
 document
 records and other information relevant to the claim and the Vice President&#8217;s review shall take into account such comments
 documents
 records and information regardless of whether it was submitted or considered at the initial determination.  The decision on review will be made within 60 days after receipt of the request for review
 unless circumstances warrant an extension of time not to exceed an additional 60 days.  If this occurs
 notice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant before the end of the initial 60-day period
 indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Vice President expects to make the final decision.  The final decision shall be in writing and drafted in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant&#59; include specific reasons for the decision with references to the specific Plan provisions on which the decision is based&#59; and provide that the claimant is entitled to receive
 upon request and free of charge
 copies of
 all documents
 records
Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court
 arbitrator or any other tribunal shall be reviewed solely on the basis of the record before the Vice President at the time it made its determination.  In addition
Any claim filed under Article VII and any action filed in any court or other tribunal by or on behalf of a former or current Employee
 Member
 Dependant or any other individual
 person or entity (collectively
 a &#8220;Petitioner&#8221;) for the alleged wrongful denial of Plan benefits must be brought within two years of the date the Petitioner&#8217;s cause of action first accrues.  For purposes of this subsection
constructive knowledge of the facts that are the basis of his claim.  Failure to bring any such claim or cause of action within this two-year time frame shall preclude a Petitioner
 or any representative of the Petitioner
Any claim or action filed in court or any other tribunal in connection with the Plan by or on behalf of a Petitioner shall only be brought or filed in the state or federal courts of New York
 specifically the state or federal court
 whichever applies
Specific references in the Plan to the Vice President&#8217;s discretion shall create no inference that the Vice President&#8217;s discretion in any other respect
 or in connection with any other provision
While the Corporation intends to continue the Plan indefinitely
 it assumes no contractual obligation as to its continuance.  The Corporation hereby reserves the right
 in its sole discretion
 to amend
 terminate
 or partially terminate the Plan at any time provided
 however
 that no such amendment or termination shall reduce the balance (determined as of the date of such amendment or termination) in the Plan account maintained for the benefit of a Member or his Dependant
The Corporation may
 in its sole discretion
 make any amendment or amendments to this Plan from time to time
 with or without retroactive effect
The Corporation may terminate the Plan
 either as to its participation or as to the participation of one or more Employers.  If the Plan is terminated with respect to fewer than all of the Employers
The Employers&#8217; obligations under the Plan shall not be funded
 but shall constitute liabilities by the Employer payable when due out of the Employer&#8217;s general funds.  To the extent a Member or any other person acquires a right to receive benefits under this Plan
Unless otherwise agreed by the Corporation
 all costs
 charges and expenses of or incidental to the administration and management of the Plan shall be the costs
If a Member is absent from duty by reason other than death
 discharge
 retirement or quitting (
 sickness
 accident
 layoff
 vacation)
 he shall be deemed to have terminated employment on the date that is 12 months after the date on which he is absent
 unless the Vice President determines otherwise.  If the Member&#8217;s absence from duty is by reason of his service as a full-time member of the armed forces of any country or of any organization engaged in national service of any such country
 he shall not be deemed to have terminated employment so long as he is regarded by the Employer as remaining in employment or until he shall resign permanently from employment
9.04&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Taxes
In the event any tax or assessment or other duty is determined by the Vice President to be owing in respect of any benefit payable from the Plan
Nothing in the Plan shall be construed as a contract of employment between an Employer and any of its employees
 or as a right of any such employee to continue in the employment of the Employer
 or as a limitation of the right of an Employer to discharge any of its employees
No person
 whether or not being a Member
 shall have any claim
 right or interest under the Plan except as provided by the terms of the Plan.  In the event of a Member&#8217;s termination of employment by an Employer
Payments to
 for or in connection with a Member that are made (as of a point in time and to any person or entity) may not exceed the exact amount of payments that are due as of such time and to such person
 as provided by the terms of the Plan that specify the amounts that are payable
 the time as of which they are payable
 and the person to whom they are payable.  Accordingly
 any such excess payment or any other overpayment
 premature payment or misdirected payment (one or more of which are hereafter referred to as an &#8220;Excess Payment&#8221;) may not be retained by the party receiving it
 but must be restored promptly to the Plan.  In exchange for Member or beneficiary status hereunder (or for having any other direct or indirect right or claim of right from the Plan
 or solely as a result of having received an Excess Payment)
(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A constructive trust and first priority equitable lien on any payment that is received directly or indirectly from the Plan and that is
 in whole or part
 an Excess Payment (such trust and lien shall be equal to the amount of the Excess Payment increased by appropriate interest) or upon the proceeds or substitutes for such payment
 and any transfer shall be subject to such constructive trust and equitable lien (including a transfer to a person
(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The right to offset (as necessary to recover the Excess Payment with appropriate interest) other payments that are properly payable by the Plan to the recipient of the Excess Payment&#59; however
 reliance on this right is in the discretion of the Vice President
(3)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The right to bring any equitable or legal action or proceeding with respect to the enforcement of any rights in this Section in any court of competent jurisdiction as the Plan may elect
Excess Payment the Member hereby submits to each such jurisdiction
Any party receiving an Excess Payment shall promptly take all actions requested by the Vice President that are in furtherance of the Plan&#8217;s recovery of the Excess Payment with appropriate interest.  In all cases
 this subsection shall maximize the rights of the Plan to recover improper payments and shall not restrict the rights of the Plan in any way
(a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary
 if the Vice President determines that a Member has engaged in Prohibited Misconduct at any time prior to the second anniversary of his termination of employment with the PepsiCo Organization
 the Member shall forfeit all Pay Credits and Interest Credits (whether paid previously
 being paid currently or payable in the future)
 and his PIRP-DC Account shall be adjusted to reflect such forfeiture and previously paid Pay Credits and Interest Credits shall be recovered.  As a condition to Membership in this Plan
(b)  Any of the following activities engaged in
 directly or indirectly
(1)  The Member accepting any employment
 assignment
 position or responsibility
 or acquiring any ownership interest
 which involves the Member&#8217;s &#8220;Participation&#8221; (as defined below) in a business entity that markets
 sells
 distributes or produces &#8220;Covered Products&#8221; (as defined below)
(2)  The Member
 directly or indirectly (including through someone else acting on the Member&#8217;s recommendation
 suggestion
 identification or advice)
(3)  The Member using or disclosing to anyone any confidential information regarding the PepsiCo Organization other than as necessary in his position with the PepsiCo Organization.  Such confidential information shall include all non-public information the Member acquired as a result of his positions with the PepsiCo Organization.  Examples of such confidential information include non-public information about the PepsiCo Organization&#8217;s customers
 suppliers
 distributors and potential acquisition targets&#59; its business operations and structure&#59; its product lines
 formulas and pricing&#59; its processes
(4)  The Member engaging in any acts that are considered to be contrary to the PepsiCo Organization&#8217;s best interests
 including violating the Corporation&#8217;s Code of Conduct
 engaging in unlawful trading in the securities of the Corporation or of any other company based on information gained as a result of his employment with the PepsiCo Organization
Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt
 nothing in this Plan shall prohibit the Member from communicating with government authorities concerning any possible legal violations without notice to the Corporation
 participating in government investigations
 and&#47;or receiving any applicable award for providing information to government authorities.  The Corporation nonetheless asserts and does not waive its attorney-client privilege over any information appropriately protected by the privilege.  Further
 pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act
 an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal
 state
 or local government official
 either directly or indirectly
 or to an attorney&#59; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law&#59; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding
 if such filing is made under seal.  An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding
 if the individual (A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal&#59; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret

 so long as the PepsiCo Organization is producing
 marketing
 selling or licensing such product anywhere in the world &#8211; beverages
 including without limitation carbonated soft drinks

 and value-added dairy drinks&#59; juices and juice products&#59; dairy products&#59; snacks

Any notice which under the Plan is required to be given to or served upon the Plan shall be deemed to be sufficiently given to or served upon the Plan if it is in writing and delivered to the Vice President.  In any case where under the Plan any notice shall be required to be given to Members
 it shall be sufficient if such notice is delivered to the Member&#8217;s last known address on file in the records of the Employer or delivered to the Member pursuant to any other method (
Payment of benefits under the Plan shall be made in United States dollars
 or other &#34;eligible currency
&#34; as approved by the Vice President.  The amount otherwise payable in United States dollars would be converted to the selected currency using the exchange rate
The Plan is intended to be exempt from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
 as amended (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;)
 as a plan maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens of the United States.  In order to preserve this exemption from ERISA
 Active Membership in the Plan shall be limited to individuals who are nonresident aliens of the United States and whose assigned work locations are outside the United States
In order to permit this Plan to be completely exempt from United States Internal Revenue Code section 409A (&#8220;Section 409A&#8221;)
 this Plan shall be subject to the special operating rules and limitations in this Section 9.14
 effective for any period to which Section 409A applies.  It is the intent of the Plan that no Member who is a U.S. Person may in any way have their benefit from the Plan vest
 increase or in any way be enhanced (collectively
 a &#8220;Benefit Enhancement&#8221;) as a result of their compensation or service while a U.S. Person.  However
provided on the PIRP-DC Account of a Member who is a U.S. Person
 but only to the extent the balance in the PIRP-DC Account is derived from Pay Credits that relate to Service completed while the Member was not a U.S. Person (and Interest Credits on such Pay Credits).  Accordingly
 no Member shall become entitled to a Benefit Enhancement with respect to a calendar year until it is determined
 following the close of such year
 that the Member was not a U.S. Person with respect to such year.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence
 in the calendar year a Member&#8217;s benefit under this Plan is scheduled to commence
 the Vice President may authorize a Benefit Enhancement for the calendar year of benefit commencement to the extent the Vice President determines satisfactorily that the Member will not be a U.S. Person for such year.  In other cases
 the Member&#8217;s benefit will commence under this Plan without any Benefit Enhancement related to the calendar year of commencement
 and appropriate adjustments will be made to the Member&#8217;s benefit in the following year if it is determined that the Member was not a U.S. Person in such calendar year of commencement.  This Section 9.14 shall at all times be interpreted and applied in accordance with the overriding requirement that allocations
 benefits and rights under the Plan must remain entirely exempt from Section 409A

January 1
The PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan (&#8220;PEP&#8221; or &#8220;Plan&#8221;) has been established by PepsiCo for the benefit of salaried employees of the PepsiCo Organization who participate in the PepsiCo Salaried Employees Retirement Plan (&#8220;Salaried Plan&#8221;).  PEP provides benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended.  In addition
.  The Plan was amended and restated in its entirety effective as of January 1
 1989.  The provisions of the Plan in effect prior to January 1
 1989 govern the rights and benefits of employees whose Credited Service ended before that date (and as necessary
.  This document (the &#8220;Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document&#8221;) was first effective as of January 1
 2005 (the &#8220;Effective Date&#8221;) and was restated to reflect amendments through December 31
 2008.  It generally retained without modification the provisions of the 1989 restatement.  However
 it was clarified to reflect that it set forth the terms of the Plan applicable to benefits that were grandfathered under Section 409A
 
 generally
 benefits that were both earned and vested on or before December 31
.  The previous restatement of the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document was effective as of April&#160;1
The 2016 restatement reflected amendments through April 1
 2016
 including amendments to reflect the merger into this Plan of the PBG Pension Equalization Plan (&#8220;PBG PEP&#8221;)
 effective at the end of the day on December&#160;31
 2011.  The PBG PEP document that was in effect on October 3
 2004 as amended through January 1
 2011 (&#8220;Pre-409A PBG PEP Document&#8221;) and as subsequently amended from time to time is attached hereto as Appendix Article PBG Pre-409A&#59; it continues to govern PBG PEP benefits that were grandfathered under Section 409A and that were subject to the Pre-409A PBG PEP Document prior to the Plan merger
.  This restatement reflects amendments through January 1
 2021
 including provisions that (i) reflect updates to the Salaried Plan&#8217;s actuarial factors that became effective January 1
 2019
.  All benefits under the Plan that are earned or vested after January&#160;1
 1989 shall be governed by the Plan Document for the Section 409A Program (the &#8220;409A Program&#8221;).  Together
.  This document (the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document) has been modified to clarify (without any material modification) the integration of the Pre-409A Program with the 409A Program.  However
 amounts subject to the terms of this Pre-409A Program and amounts subject to the terms of the 409A Program shall be tracked separately at all times.  The preservation of the terms of the Pre-409A Program
 without material modification
&#58;  This section provides definitions for certain words and phrases. Where the following words and phrases
 in boldface and underlined
 appear in this Plan with initial capitals they shall have the meaning set forth below
&#58;  The Pension payable at Normal Retirement Date determined in accordance with Article&#160;V
&#58;  Except as otherwise specifically set forth in the Plan or any Appendix to the Plan with respect to a specific benefit determination
 a benefit of equivalent value computed on the basis of the factors set forth below.  The application of the following assumptions to the computation of benefits payable under the Plan shall be done in a uniform and consistent manner.  In the event the Plan is amended to provide new rights
 features or benefits
Annuity Starting Dates After December 31
&#58;  To determine the amount of a Pension payable as of an Annuity Starting Date after December 31
 2018 (A) in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or other form of survivor annuity
 (B) as an annuity with inflation protection
 or (C) as a period certain and life annuity or other death benefit annuity
 the Plan Administrator shall specify the factors that are to be used.  Effective January 1
2019
 the factors specified by the Plan Administrator are set forth in Schedule 1 below.  Subsequently
 the Plan Administrator may specify new factors for these and other forms of payment
 in its sole and absolute discretion
 by a resolution adopted by the Plan Administrator.  A Participant&#8217;s benefit under the Pre-409A Program shall be determined under the actuarial factors specified and in effect as of the Annuity Starting Date of the Participant&#8217;s benefit.  For the avoidance of doubt
 it is expressly intended and binding upon Participants that any actuarial factors for forms of payment specified by the Plan Administrator may be applied retroactively to previously accrued benefits
 and without regard to the factors that previously applied for such purpose.  In particular
 in adjusting benefits under the Plan using the factors in Schedule 1 (below)
 the right to a benefit that is not less than would have applied under the prior basis for this adjustment shall not apply (even when
 for example
 it would apply under the Salaried Plan with respect to the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors).  For this purpose
 the phrase &#8220;2019 Salaried Plan Factors&#8221; refers to the new factors that appear in the Salaried Plan&#8217;s definition of &#8220;Actuarial Equivalent&#8221; effective for annuity starting dates (as defined under the Salaried Plan) on or after January 1
 2019.  If a Participant elects a survivor
 period certain annuity or other death benefit annuity with inflation protection
 Schedule 1(a) shall apply to adjust the Single Life Annuity for the survivor benefit
  period certain or other death benefit
 and Schedule 1(b) or (c) shall apply solely to adjust for the elected inflation protection (for this purpose and as applies generally when determining an Actuarial Equivalent
Annuity Starting Dates Before January 1
&#58;  To determine the amount of a Pension payable as of an Annuity Starting Date before January 1
 2019
 and in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or other form of survivor annuity
 or as an annuity with inflation protection
 the factors applicable as of such time for such purposes under the Salaried Plan shall apply.  However
 in determining a Pre-409A Pension payable as of an Annuity Starting Date before January 1
 2019
 no change in such factors occurring on or after the Effective Date in the basis for determining the amount of an annuity form of payment from that in effect as of December 31
 2004 shall be taken into account to the extent it would result in a larger annuity (but this sentence shall not apply for purposes of Section 5.1(b)(3)
&#58;  To determine the lump sum value of a Pension
 or a Pre-Retirement Spouse&#8217;s Pension under Section&#160;4.6
 the factors applicable for such purposes under the Salaried Plan shall apply
 except that when the term &#8220;PBGC Rate&#8221; is used in the Salaried Plan in this context it shall mean &#8220;PBGC Rate&#8221; as defined in this Plan.  However
Pension
 no amendment
 which is effective on or after the Effective Date
 to the Salaried Plan&#8217;s provisions for determining lump sums from those in effect as of December 31
 2004 shall be taken into account to the extent that doing so is expected to result in a larger lump sum (or in the case of a Salaried Plan amendment that becomes effective on or after January&#160;1
 2015
 a different lump sum
 unless this Pre-409A Program document is amended to expressly apply the Salaried Plan amendment in determining a Pre-409A Pension)
 but this sentence shall not apply for purposes of Section 5.1(b)(3)
 relating to the &#8220;Limit on the Pre-409A Pension Benefit.&#8221;  For example
 therefore
 the Salaried Plan amendment that adopted Pension Protection Act factors for lump sums effective January 1
 2008 is generally taken into account under the Pre-409A Program
 but the Salaried Plan amendment that changed the &#8220;lookback period&#8221; and &#8220;stability period&#8221; for lump sums effective January 1
 2015 is not taken account under the Pre-409A Program
&#58;  To determine the adjustment to be made in the Pension payable to or on behalf of a Participant in other cases (including to reduce a Vested Pension for early commencement)
 the factors are those applicable for such purpose under the Salaried Plan.  However
 in determining a Pre-409A Pension
 no change occurring on or after the Effective Date in such factors from those in effect as of December 31
 2004 shall be taken into account to the extent that it would result in a larger pension (but this sentence shall not apply for purposes of Section 5.1(b)(3)
&#58;  A Participant&#8217;s election to receive his Pre-409A Retirement Pension as a Single Lump Sum or an Annuity

Annuity payments to a surviving Eligible Spouse shall begin on the first day of the month coincident with or following the Participant&#8217;s death and shall end with the last monthly payment due prior to the Eligible Spouse&#8217;s death.  If the Eligible Spouse is more than 10 years younger than the Participant

&#58;  This subsection shall apply to a current or former Participant who is reemployed after his Annuity Starting Date and whose benefit under the Salaried Plan is recalculated based on an additional period of Credited Service.  In the event of any such recalculation
 the Participant&#8217;s Pre-409A Pension shall also be recalculated hereunder.  For this purpose
 the PEP Guarantee under Section&#160;5.2 is adjusted for in-service distributions and prior distributions in the same manner as benefits are adjusted under the Salaried Plan
&#58;  If the benefit paid under a specified plan on behalf of a Participant is increased after PEP benefits on his behalf have been determined (whether the increase is by order of a court

 or (ii) who terminates employment prior to Retirement.  Subject to the next sentence
 a Participant described in this subsection shall be paid his Pre-409A Pension in the same form and at the same time as he is paid his Pension under the Salaried Plan.  If a Participant&#8217;s Salaried Plan Annuity Starting Date occurs while he is still an employee of the PepsiCo Organization (because of the time of payment provisions in Code section 401(a)(9))
 payment under the Plan shall not begin until the first of the month next following the Participant&#8217;s Severance from Service Date.  In this instance

 a &#8220;qualifying Salaried Plan election&#8221; is a written election of a form of payment by the Participant that&#58; (A) is currently in effect under the Salaried Plan as of the close of business on the day before the Participant&#8217;s Retirement Date
 and (B)&#160;specifies an Annuity as the form of payment for all or part of the Participant&#8217;s Retirement Pension under the Salaried Plan.  For purposes of the preceding sentence

 and the remaining portion in the form of one of the monthly benefits described in paragraphs (1) and (2) above.  The Pre-409A Pension is divided between the two forms of payment based on the whole number percentages designated by the Participant on a form provided for this purpose by the Plan Administrator.  For the election to be effective
(i)  The amount of the Pre-409A Pension paid in the form of a lump sum is determined by multiplying&#58; (A) the amount that would be payable to the Participant as a Single Lump Sum payment if the Participant&#8217;s entire benefit were payable in that form
(ii)  The amount of the Pre-409A Pension paid in the form of a monthly benefit is determined by multiplying&#58; (A) the amount of the monthly benefit elected by the Participant

Benefits shall be subject to increase in accordance with this subsection each January 1
 beginning with the second January 1 following the Participant&#8217;s Annuity Starting Date.  The amount of inflation in the prior year shall be determined based on inflation in the 12-month period ending on September 30 of such year
 with inflation measured in the same manner as applies on the Effective Date for adjusting Social Security benefits for changes in the cost of living.  Inflation protection that is in effect shall carry over to any survivor benefit payable on behalf of a Participant
&#58;  The forms of payment available for a Participant with a Pre-409A Vested Pension are a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or a 75 Percent Survivor Annuity for married Participants

&#58;  The Advance Election must be received by the Plan Administrator before the start of the calendar year containing the Participant&#8217;s Retirement Date
&#58;  A Plan Participant may change an Advance Election by filing a new Election that meets the foregoing requirements.  A&#160;Plan Participant may revoke an Advance Election only by filing a revocation that is received by the Plan Administrator before the start of the calendar year containing the Plan Participant&#8217;s Retirement Date
&#58;  A PEP Election may only be made by a Participant who has an Advance Election to receive an Annuity in effect at the time his PEP Election is received by the Plan Administrator.  In determining whether an Advance Election is in effect for this purpose
&#58;  The Participant shall designate on the PEP Election form the Annuity form of benefit the Participant selects from those described in Section&#160;6.2
 including the Participant&#8217;s choice of inflation protection

 with the following exception.  In the case of a Participant who is rehired after his initial Annuity Starting Date and who (i)&#160;is currently receiving an Annuity that remained in pay status upon rehire
 or (ii)&#160;was previously paid a lump sum distribution (other than a cashout distribution described in Section&#160;4.9(a))
 the Participant&#8217;s subsequent Annuity Starting Date (as a result of his termination of reemployment)
 and the election procedures at such subsequent Annuity Starting Date
For purposes of this section
 an election shall be treated as received on a particular day if it is&#58; (A)&#160;postmarked that day
 or (B) actually received by the Plan Administrator on that day.  Delivery under clause (B) must be made by the close of business
&#58;  If a Participant makes a PEP Election for a form of payment described in Section&#160;6.2(a)(2) and the Participant or his beneficiary (beneficiaries in the case of Section&#160;6.2(a)(2)(iv)) dies before the PEP Election becomes effective
 the election shall be disregarded.  If the Participant dies after such PEP Election becomes effective but before his Pre-409A Retirement Pension actually commences
 the election shall be given effect and the amount payable to his surviving Eligible Spouse or other beneficiary shall commence on the first day of the month following his death (any back payments due the Participant shall be payable to his estate).  In the case of a Participant who has elected the form of payment described in Section&#160;6.2(a)(2)(iv)
 if such Participant dies&#58;  (i) after the PEP Election has become effective
 (ii) without a surviving primary or contingent beneficiary
 and (iii) before receiving 120 payments under the form of payment
 then the remaining payments due under such form of payment shall be paid to the Participant&#8217;s estate.  If payments have commenced under such form of payment to a Participant&#8217;s primary or contingent beneficiary and such beneficiary dies before payments are completed
&#58;  If a Participant&#8217;s beneficiary is not his Eligible Spouse
(i)  The 100 percent survivor option described in Section&#160;6.2(a)(2)(i) if his nonspouse beneficiary is more than 10 years younger than he is
&#58;  A Participant who has elected to receive all or part of his pension in a form of payment that includes a survivor option shall designate a beneficiary who will be entitled to any amounts payable on his death.  Such designation shall be made on a PEP Election Form or an approved election form filed under the Salaried Plan
 whichever is applicable.  In the case of the survivor option described in Section&#160;6.2(a)(2)(iv)
 the Participant shall be entitled to name both a primary beneficiary and a contingent  beneficiary.  A Participant (whether active or former) shall have the right to change or revoke his beneficiary designation at any time prior to when his election is finally effective.  The designation of any beneficiary
 and any change or revocation thereof
 shall be made in accordance with rules adopted by the Plan Administrator.  A beneficiary designation shall not be effective unless and until filed with the Plan Administrator.  If no beneficiary is properly designated
 then a Participant&#8217;s election of a survivor&#8217;s option described in Section&#160;6.2(a)(2) shall not be given effect.  A Participant entitled to a Pre-409A Vested Pension does not have the right or ability to name a beneficiary&#59; if the Participant is permitted under Section 6.2 to elect an optional form of payment
&#58;  As provided in section 6.7 of the Plan Document for the Section 409A Program
 a portion of a Participant&#8217;s 409A Pension
 if any
 shall be paid as a single lump sum and remitted directly to the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) or other applicable tax authority in satisfaction of the Participant&#8217;s FICA Amount and the related withholding of income tax at source on wages (imposed under Code Section 3401 or the corresponding withholding provisions of the applicable state
 local or foreign tax laws as a result of the payment of the FICA Amount) and the additional withholding of income tax at source on wages that is attributable to the pyramiding of wages and taxes (all such amounts due are referred to collectively as &#8220;Employment Taxes&#8221;).  To the extent that a Participant&#8217;s 409A Pension
 if any
 is insufficient to pay the Employment Taxes when due (including if the Participant&#8217;s 409A Pension has not commenced at the time the Employment Taxes are due)
 a portion of the Participant&#8217;s Pre-409A Pension
 if any
&#58;  The Plan shall be administered by the Plan Administrator
 which shall have the authority to interpret the Plan and issue such regulations as it deems appropriate.  The Plan Administrator shall maintain Plan records and make benefit calculations
 and may rely upon information furnished it by the Participant in writing
 including the Participant&#8217;s current mailing address
 age and marital status.  The Plan Administrator&#8217;s interpretations
 determinations
 regulations and calculations shall be final and binding on all persons and parties concerned.  Neither the Company nor the Plan Administrator shall be a fiduciary of the Plan
 and any restrictions that might apply to a party in interest under section 406 of ERISA shall not apply under the Plan
&#58;  Whenever
 in the Plan Administrator&#8217;s opinion
 a person entitled to receive any payment of a benefit or installment thereof hereunder is under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his financial affairs
 the Plan Administrator may make payments to such person or to the legal representative of such person for his benefit

 benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Plan Administrator decides in its discretion that the person claiming such benefits is entitled to them.  This discretionary authority is intended to be absolute
 and in any case where the extent of this discretion is in question
 the Plan Administrator is to be accorded the maximum discretion possible.  Any exercise of this discretionary authority shall be reviewed by a court
 arbitrator or other tribunal under the arbitrary and capricious standard (
 the abuse of discretion standard).  If
 pursuant to this discretionary authority
 an assertion of any right to a benefit by or on behalf of a Participant or beneficiary (a &#8220;claimant&#8221;) is wholly or partially denied
 the Plan Administrator
 or a party designated by the Plan Administrator
 will provide such claimant the claims review process described in this Section.  The Plan Administrator has the discretionary right to modify the claims process described in this Section in any manner so long as the claims review process
 as modified
 includes the steps described below.  Within a 90-day response period following the receipt of the claim by the Plan Administrator
If the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances required an extension of time for processing the claim it may extend the response period from 90 to 180 days.  If this occurs
 the Plan Administrator will notify the claimant before the end of the initial 90-day period
 indicating the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to make the final decision.  Further review of a claim is available upon written request by the claimant to the Plan Administrator within 60 days after the claimant receives written notice of the denial of the claim.  Upon review
 the Plan Administrator shall provide the claimant a full and fair review of the claim
 including the opportunity to submit to the Plan Administrator comments
 documents
 records and other information relevant to the claim and the Plan Administrator&#8217;s review shall take into account such comments
 documents
 records and information regardless of whether it was submitted or considered at the initial determination.  The decision on review will be made within 60 days after receipt of the request for review
 unless circumstances warrant an extension of time not to exceed an additional 60 days.  If this occurs
 notice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant before the end of the initial 60-day period
Any claim under the Plan that is reviewed by a court
 arbitrator
 or any other tribunal shall be reviewed solely on the basis of the record before the Plan Administrator at the time it made its determination.  In addition

 (ii) whose Salaried Plan Pension is vested during 1993 (or would become vested in 1994 if his Service included the assumed period of continued service specified in (a)(1) below)
 and (iii) whose minimum 1993 Pension in subsection (a) below is not derived solely from that portion of the Plan described in (c) of Article&#160;X.  In determining the amount of the 1993 and 1994 Pension amounts for any such individual
&#58;  Any individual who is covered by this section shall accrue a minimum 1993 Pension as of December 31
 1993.  In determining the amount of such individual&#8217;s minimum 1993 Pension
(1)  An individual&#8217;s Service and Credited Service as of the end of 1993 shall be assumed to equal the respective Service and Credited Service he would have if his Service continued through December 31
 1994.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence
 the assumed period of continued Service shall be less to the extent the Corporation&#8217;s human resource records on December 31
 1993 reflect a scheduled termination date in 1994 for such individual.  In this case
(2)  An individual&#8217;s Highest Average Monthly Earnings as of the end of 1993 shall be adjusted by the actuary&#8217;s salary scale assumption which is used under the Salaried Plan
 so that they equal the amount such scale projects for the individual as of the end of 1994. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence
(i)  A higher salary scale assumption shall be used for anyone whose projected 1994 earnings as reflected on the &#8220;Special PEP Salary Scale&#8221; of the PepsiCo Benefits Department on December 31
 1993 are higher than would be assumed under the first sentence of this paragraph.  In this case
(ii)  In the case of an individual whose assumed period of service under paragraph (1) above is less than all of 1994
Any individual who is covered by this section
 and who is not otherwise vested as of December 31
 1993
 shall be vested as of such date in both his Pension (determined without regard to this subsection) and his minimum 1993 Pension.  For purposes of this subsection
&#58;  If a participant in the Salaried Plan accrues a minimum 1993 Pension under subsection (a) above
&#58;  Except as set forth in subsection B.4 below
&#58;  If a Pension becomes payable to or on behalf of a Pre-2005 Participant
 the following Sections 5.1

 5.2 and 5.3 of the main Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document
 and the amount of the Pre-2005 Participant&#8217;s Pension shall be determined under Section&#160;5.1
 5.2 or 5.3 below (whichever is applicable)
 subject to any adjustments required under Sections&#160;4.6(b)
  If a Pre-2005 Participant&#8217;s Pension will be paid in the same form and will commence as of the same time as his pension under the Salaried Plan
(1)  His Total Pension expressed in such form and payable as of such time
&#58;  If a Pre-2005 Participant&#8217;s Pension will be paid in a different form (whether in whole or in part) or will commence as of a different time than his pension under the Salaried Plan
(1)  The amount of the Pre-2005 Participant&#8217;s Total Pension expressed in the form and payable as of such time as applies to his Pension under this Plan
(2)  A fraction
 the value of his Salaried Plan Pension
 and the denominator of which is the value of his Total Pension (with value determined on a reasonable and consistent basis
 in the discretion of the Plan Administrator
(i)  The amount of the Pre-2005 Participant&#8217;s pension determined under the terms of the Salaried Plan
 but without regard to&#58;  (A) the limitations imposed by sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Code (as such limitations are interpreted and applied under the Salaried Plan)
In making this comparison
 the benefits in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be calculated with reference to the specific form and time of payment that is applicable.  If the applicable form of payment is a lump sum
&#58;  A Pre-2005 Participant who is eligible under subsection (a) below shall be entitled to a PEP Guarantee benefit determined under subsection (b) below.  In the case of other Pre-2005 Participants
&#58;  A Pre-2005 Participant shall be covered by this section if the Pre-2005 Participant has 1988 pensionable earnings from an Employer of at least $75
000.  For purposes of this section
 &#8220;1988 pensionable earnings&#8221; means the Pre-2005 Participant&#8217;s remuneration for the 1988 calendar year
&#58;  The amount of a Pre-2005 Participant&#8217;s PEP Guarantee shall be determined under the applicable formula in paragraph (1)
below.  However
 if the Pre-2005 Participant was actively employed by the PepsiCo Organization in a classification eligible for the Salaried Plan prior to July 1
 1975
 the amount of his Pension under this paragraph shall be the greater of the amounts determined under subparagraphs (i) and (ii)
(A)  3 percent of the Pre-2005 Participant&#8217;s Highest Average Monthly Earnings for the first 10 years of Credited Service
(B)  1 percent of the Pre-2005 Participant&#8217;s Highest Average Monthly Earnings for each year of Credited Service in excess of 10 years
In determining the amount of a Vested Pension under this Formula&#160;A
 the Pension shall first be calculated on the basis of (I) the Credited Service the Pre-2005 Participant would have earned had he remained in the employ of the Employer until his Normal Retirement Age
 and (II) his Highest Average Monthly Earnings and Primary Social Security Amount at his Severance from Service Date
the resulting amount by a fraction
(A)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;1-1&#47;2 percent of Highest Average Monthly Earnings times the number of years of Credited Service
 less 50 percent of the Pre-2005 Participant&#8217;s Primary Social Security Amount
(B)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;3 percent of Highest Average Monthly Earnings times the number of years of Credited Service up to 15 years
In determining the amount of a Disability Pension under Formula A or B above
 the Pension shall be calculated on the basis of the Pre-2005 Participant&#8217;s Credited Service (determined in accordance with Section&#160;3.3(d)(3) of the Salaried Plan)
&#58;  The amount of the PEP Guarantee shall be determined pursuant to paragraph (1) above

 payment under the Plan shall not begin until the first of the month next following the Participant&#8217;s Severance from Service Date.  In this instance
&#58;  This subsection shall apply to a Participant&#58;  (i) who has an Advance Election in effect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date
 and (ii) whose Retirement Date is after 1993.  To be in effect
&#58;  If a Participant covered by this subsection has an Advance Election to receive a Single Lump Sum in effect as of the close of business on the day before his Retirement Date

&#58;  A Participant who has a qualifying Salaried Plan election shall receive his distribution in the same form of Annuity the Participant selected in such qualifying Salaried Plan election.  For this purpose
 a &#8220;qualifying Salaried Plan election&#8221; is a written election of a form of payment by the Participant that&#58; (A) is currently in effect under the Salaried Plan as of the close of business on the day before the Participant&#8217;s Retirement Date
 and (B) specifies an Annuity as the form of payment for all or part of the Participant&#8217;s Retirement Pension under the Salaried Plan.  For purposes of the preceding sentence
&#58;  A Participant who is not covered by subparagraph (i) or (ii) above shall receive his distribution in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity if he is married
 or in the form of a Single Life Annuity if he is not married.  For purposes of this subparagraph (iii)
&#58;  A Participant may receive his Pension in the form of a Single Life Annuity
&#58;  The Participant shall receive a reduced Pension payable for life
 ending with the last monthly payment due prior to his death.  Payments in the same reduced amount shall continue after the Participant&#8217;s death to his beneficiary for life
&#58;  The Participant shall receive a reduced Pension payable for life
 ending with the last monthly payment due prior to his death.  Payments in the amount of 75 percent of such reduced Pension shall be continued after the Participant&#8217;s death to his beneficiary for life
&#58;  The Participant shall receive a reduced Pension payable for life
 ending with the last monthly payment due prior to his death.  Payments in the amount of 50 percent of such reduced Pension shall be continued after the Participant&#8217;s death to his beneficiary for life
&#58; The Participant shall receive a reduced Pension which shall be payable monthly for his lifetime but for not less than 120 months.  If the retired Participant dies before 120 payments have been made
 the monthly Pension amount shall be paid for the remainder of the 120 month period to the Participant&#8217;s primary beneficiary (or if the primary beneficiary has predeceased the Participant
the form of a lump sum payment
 and the remaining portion in the form of one of the monthly benefits described in paragraphs (1) and (2) above.  The Pension is divided between the two forms of payment based on the whole number percentages designated by the Participant on a form provided for this purpose by the Plan Administrator.  For the election to be effective
(i)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The amount of the Pension paid in the form of a lump sum is determined by multiplying&#58; (A) the amount that would be payable to the Participant as a Single Lump Sum payment if the Participant&#8217;s entire benefit were payable in that form
(ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The amount of the Pension paid in the form of a monthly benefit is determined by multiplying&#58; (A) the amount of the monthly benefit elected by the Participant
 determined in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) above (whichever applies)
&#58;  A Participant&#8217;s monthly benefit shall be initially reduced
&#58;  A Participant&#8217;s monthly benefit shall be initially reduced
Benefits shall be subject to increase in accordance with this subsection each January 1
 beginning with the second January 1 following the Participant&#8217;s Annuity Starting Date.  The amount of inflation in the prior year shall be determined based on inflation in the 12 month period ending on September 30 of such year
 with inflation measured in the same manner as applies on January 1
 1989 for adjusting Social Security benefits for changes in the cost of living.  Inflation protection that is in effect shall carry over to any survivor benefit payable on behalf of a Participant
&#58;  To qualify as an Advance Election or PEP Election for purposes of Section 6.1
 an election must be made in writing
 on the form designated by the Plan Administrator
&#58;  To qualify as an Advance Election
 an election must be made under this Plan on or after July 15
&#58;  The Advance Election must be received by the Plan Administrator before the start of the calendar year containing the Participant&#8217;s Retirement Date
&#58;  A Plan Participant may change an Advance Election by filing a new Election that meets the foregoing requirements.  A Plan Participant may revoke an Advance Election only by filing a revocation that is received by the Plan Administrator before the start of the calendar year containing the Plan Participant&#8217;s Retirement Date
purpose
&#58;  The Participant shall designate on the PEP Election form the Annuity form of benefit the Participant selects from those described in Section 6.2
 including the Participant&#8217;s choice of inflation protection
&#58;  The PEP Election must be received by the Plan Administrator no earlier than 90 days before the Participant&#8217;s Retirement Date
 and no later than the close of business on the day before the Participant&#8217;s Retirement Date.  The Participant shall furnish proof of the age of his beneficiary (including his Eligible Spouse if applicable)
 to the Plan Administrator by the day before the Participant&#8217;s Retirement Date
&#58;  When amounts become payable to a Participant in accordance with Article IV
 they shall be payable as of the Participant&#8217;s Annuity Starting Date and the election procedures (in this section and Sections 6.1 and 6.5) shall apply to all of the Participant&#8217;s unpaid accruals as of such Annuity Starting Date
with the following exception.  In the case of a Participant who is rehired after his initial Annuity Starting Date and who (i) is currently receiving an Annuity that remained in pay status upon rehire
 or (ii) was previously paid a lump sum distribution (other than a cashout distribution described in Section 4.9(a))
 the Participant&#8217;s subsequent Annuity Starting Date (as a result of his termination of reemployment)
 and the election procedures at such subsequent Annuity Starting Date
For purposes of this section
 an election shall be treated as received on a particular day if it is&#58; (A) postmarked that day
  or (B) actually received by the Plan Administrator on that day.  Delivery under clause (B) must be made by the close of business
&#58;  If a Participant makes a PEP Election for a form of payment described in Section 6.2(a)(2) and the Participant or his beneficiary (beneficiaries in the case of Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv)) dies before the PEP Election becomes effective
 the election shall be disregarded.  If the Participant dies after such PEP Election becomes effective but before his Retirement Pension actually commences
 the election shall be given effect and the amount payable to his surviving Eligible Spouse or other beneficiary shall commence on the first day of the month following his death (any back payments due the Participant shall be payable to his estate).  In the case of a Participant who has elected the form of payment described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv)
 if such Participant dies&#58;  (i) after the PEP Election has become effective
without a surviving primary or contingent beneficiary
 and (iii) before receiving 120 payments under the form of payment
 then the remaining payments due under such form of payment shall be paid to the Participant&#8217;s estate.  If payments have commenced under such form of payment to a Participant&#8217;s primary or contingent beneficiary and such beneficiary dies before payments are completed
&#58;  If a Participant&#8217;s beneficiary is not his Eligible Spouse
(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 100 percent survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(i) if his nonspouse beneficiary is more than 10 years younger than he is
&#58;  A Participant who has elected to receive all or part of his pension in a form of payment that includes a survivor option shall designate a beneficiary who will be entitled to any amounts payable on his death.  Such designation shall be made on a PEP Election Form or an approved election form filed under the Salaried Plan
 whichever is applicable.  In the case of the survivor option described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv)
 the Participant shall be entitled to name both a primary beneficiary and a contingent  beneficiary.  A Participant (whether active or former) shall have the right to change or revoke his beneficiary designation at any time prior to when his election is finally effective.  The designation of any beneficiary
 and any change or revocation thereof
 shall be made in accordance with rules adopted by the Plan Administrator.  A beneficiary designation shall not be effective unless and until filed with the Plan Administrator (or for periods before the Effective Date
Administrator under the Prior Plan).  If no beneficiary is properly designated
This Appendix sets forth additional provisions applicable to individuals specified in the Articles of this Appendix.  In any case where there is a conflict between the Appendix and the main text of the Plan
&#58;  This section shall apply to any individual&#58; (i) who was a Salaried Plan Participant and employed by the PBG Organization on December 31
 1993
 (ii) whose Salaried Plan Pension was vested during 1993 (or would have become vested in 1994 if his Service after 1993 included the assumed period of continued service specified in (a)(1) below)

(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An individual&#8217;s Highest Average Monthly Earnings as of the end of 1993 shall be adjusted by the actuary&#8217;s salary scale assumption which is used under the Salaried Plan
 so that they equal the amount such scale projects for the individual as of the end of 1994. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence
(i)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A higher salary scale assumption shall be used for anyone whose projected 1994 earnings as reflected on the &#8220;Special PEP Salary Scale&#8221; of the PBG Benefits Department on December 31
 1993 were higher than would be assumed under the first sentence of this paragraph.  In this case
(ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the case of an individual whose assumed period of service under paragraph (1) above is less than all of 1994
Any individual who is covered by this section
 and who is not otherwise vested as of December 31
 1993

APPENDIX ARTICLE H - Definitions of Eligible Domestic Partner Applicable Prior to January 1
The PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan (&#8220;PEP&#8221; or &#8220;Plan&#8221;) has been established by PepsiCo for the benefit of salaried employees of the PepsiCo Organization who participate in the Salaried Plan.  PEP provides benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the Salaried Plan are limited by the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended.  In addition
 PEP provides benefits for certain eligible employees based on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula (see
 for example
.  The Plan was last amended and restated in its entirety effective as of January&#160;1
 2005.  The 2005 restatement sets forth the terms of the Plan that are applicable to benefits that are subject to Section 409A
 
 generally
 benefits that are earned or vested after December 31
.  The 2005 restatement was amended to reflect the merger into this Plan of the PBG Pension Equalization Plan (&#8220;PBG PEP&#8221;)
 effective at the end of the day on December 31
 2011.  The PBG PEP document that was in effect on April 1
 2009
 as amended through January 1
 2011 (the &#8220;409A PBG PEP Document&#8221;) is attached hereto as Appendix Article PBG 409A and shall continue to govern PBG PEP benefits that were subject to the 409A PBG PEP Document prior to the Plan merger
2017
 2019
.  This restatement of the 409A Program Document is effective as of January 1
 2021.  Before this restatement
 the 409A Program Document was most recently restated effective as of January 1
 2019 and prior to that
 effective as of January 1
.  All benefits under the Plan that are not subject to the 409A Program (i.e.
 generally
 benefits that are earned or vested before January 1
 2005 and not materially modified thereafter within the meaning of Treas. Reg. &#167;&#160;1.409A-6(a)(4)) shall be governed by the Plan Document for the Pre-Section 409 Program (the &#8220;Pre-409A Program&#8221;).  Together
 this document and the document for the Pre-409A Program describe the terms of a single plan.  However
 amounts subject to the terms of this 409A Program and amounts subject to the terms of the Pre-409A Program shall be tracked separately at all times.  The preservation of the terms of the Pre-409A Program
 without material modification
.  In general
 the Plan provides benefits that make up for benefits that would accrue under the Salaried Plan but for certain Code limitations on benefits and compensation that apply to the Salaried Plan.  As a result
Participants
 there are special provisions in Section 5.2 (the &#8220;PEP Guarantee&#8221;) or the Appendix that provide a benefit accrual opportunity that goes beyond providing a make up for the application of Code limitations to the Salaried Plan.  Regardless
 however
 the freeze on accruals under the Salaried Plan that is effective as of the end of the day on December 31
 2025 also freezes all accruals under this Plan effective as of that time.  In addition
 the Salaried Plan&#8217;s operational rules with respect to the ability to grow into benefit enhancements after December 31
 2025 govern the ability to grow into benefit enhancements after December 31
&#58;  This section provides definitions for certain words and phrases listed below.  Where the following words and phrases
 in boldface and underlined
 appear in this Plan document (including the Foreword) with initial capitals they shall have the meaning set forth below
&#58;  The Pension payable at Normal Retirement Date determined in accordance with Article&#160;V
&#58;  Except as otherwise specifically set forth in the Plan or any Appendix to the Plan with respect to a specific benefit determination
 a benefit of equivalent value computed on the basis of the factors set forth below.  The application of the following assumptions to the computation of benefits payable under the Plan shall be done in a uniform and consistent manner.  In the event the Plan is amended to provide new rights
 features or benefits
&#58;  To determine the amount of a Pension payable in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or optional form of survivor annuity
 as an annuity with inflation protection
 or as a period certain and life annuity
 the Plan Administrator shall select the factors that are to be used.  Effective January 1
 2009
 the factors selected by the Plan Administrator are set forth in Schedule 1
factors appear in the Appendix).  Thereafter
 the Plan Administrator shall review such factors for forms of payment (including for annuities and lump sums) from time to time and shall amend such factors in its discretion.  In general
 a Participant shall have no right to have any of the actuarial factors specified for forms of payment under the Plan from time to time applied to his benefit (or any portion thereof)
 except to the extent that a particular factor is currently in effect at the time it is to be applied under the Plan.  For the avoidance of doubt
 it is expressly intended and binding upon Participants that any actuarial factors for forms of payment selected by the Plan Administrator from time-to-time may be applied retroactively to already accrued benefits
 and without regard to the actuarial factors that may have applied previously for such purpose.  However
 in adjusting benefits under the Plan using those factors in Schedule 1 (below) that become effective for Annuity Starting Dates on or after January 1
 2019
 the right to receive a benefit that is not less than would have applied under the prior basis for this adjustment shall apply to the same extent (and in the same manner) as applies under the Salaried Plan with respect to the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors.  For this purpose
 the phrase &#8220;2019 Salaried Plan Factors&#8221; refers to the new factors that appear in the Salaried Plan&#8217;s definition of &#8220;Actuarial Equivalent&#8221; effective for annuity starting dates (as defined under the Salaried Plan) on or after January 1
 2019.  Effective for Annuity Starting Dates on or after January 1
 2019
 if a Participant elects a survivor
 period certain annuity or other death benefit annuity with inflation protection
 Schedule 1(b) shall apply to adjust the Single Life Annuity for the survivor benefit
death benefit
 and Schedule 1(c) or (d) shall apply solely to adjust for the elected inflation protection (for this purpose and as applies generally when determining an Actuarial Equivalent
&#58;  To determine the lump sum value of a Pension
 a Pre-Retirement Spouse&#8217;s Pension under Section&#160;4.6
 or a Pre-Retirement Domestic Partner&#8217;s Pension under Section 4.12
&#58;  To determine the adjustment to be made in the Pension payable to or on behalf of a Participant in other cases
 the factors are those applicable for such purpose under the Salaried Plan.  In this respect
 the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors shall be effective hereunder for Annuity Starting Dates (as defined under this Plan) on or after January 1
&#58;  The Annuity Starting Date shall be the first day of the first period for which an amount is payable under this Plan as an annuity or in any other form.  A Participant who&#58; (1) is reemployed after his initial Annuity Starting Date
 and (2) is entitled to benefits hereunder after his reemployment

 or on behalf of
&#58;  The period of time beginning with a Participant&#8217;s first date of employment with the PepsiCo Organization and ending with the Participant&#8217;s Final Separation from Service
 irrespective of any breaks in service between those two dates.  By way of illustration
 if a Participant began employment with the PepsiCo Organization on January 1
 2000
 left the employment of the PepsiCo Organization from January 1
 2001 until December 31
 2004
 and was then reemployed by the PepsiCo Organization on January 1
 2005 until he had a Final Separation from Service on December 31
 2008
  The definition in this Section 2.1 is effective for applicable dates on and after January 1
 2019
 and applies solely to a Participant who is actively employed by
 or on an Authorized Leave of Absence from
 a member of the PepsiCo Organization on or after January 1
 2019. For other dates or Participants

 and as if he received Credited Service and Earnings under the Salaried Plan for the Year of Transfer equal to &#8211; (i) his actual Credited Service and Earnings under the Salaried Plan for the Year of Transfer
 (ii) any other compensation and service for the Year of Transfer that would have been recognized as PIRP-DB Salary and PIRP DB Pensionable Service
(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If (during a year a PIRP Transfer Participant is otherwise accruing benefits under this Plan) the PIRP Transfer Participant would be credited with PIRP-DB Salary that cannot be recognized under PIRP as a result of Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB
 and if this PIRP-DB Salary would be considered for accrual purposes under PIRP-DB in connection with PIRP-DB Pensionable Service that is not recognized under this Plan
Accrued Benefit under PIRP that is related to this PIRP-DB Pensionable Service and that is blocked by Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB shall be added to the PIRP Transfer Participant&#8217;s Accrued Benefit under this Plan.  In the case of a PIRP Transfer Participant who has a  Separation from Service on or after January 1
 2017
 this increase in the PIRP Transfers Participant&#8217;s Accrued Benefit under this Plan shall result in an appropriate increase
 determined in the Company&#8217;s discretion
 in the Total Pension determined under paragraph (1) above. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 in determining Credited Service and Earnings under this subsection (a)
 no compensation or service shall be taken into account more than once
 and a PIRP Transfer Participant&#8217;s Total Pension shall be determined in a way that avoids any duplication of benefits that will be provided to or on behalf of the PIRP Transfer Participant under PIRP-DB (after applying Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB) or another plan maintained or contributed to by the Company or an affiliate
&#58;  The PIRP Transfer Participant&#8217;s benefit under the Plan shall be calculated by reducing his Total Pension as determined under subsection (a) above by the reductions that are normally applicable under Article V.  In addition
 in the case of a PIRP Transfer Participant who has a  Separation from Service on or after January 1
 2017
under PIRP-DB
 then the projected increase in value of the PIRP-DB benefit at the PIRP Transfer Participant&#8217;s retirement under PIRP-DB
 which will be blocked by Section 9.14 of PIRP
 shall result in an appropriate increase
 determined in the Company&#8217;s discretion
 in the Participant&#8217;s benefit under this Plan that is payable at the time and in the form applicable under this Plan.  The appropriate increase shall be determined net of any expected increase in the value of the benefit under this Plan related to becoming eligible for Early Retirement under this Plan.  In addition
 a PIRP Transfer Participant&#8217;s appropriate increase shall be determined in a way that avoids any duplication of benefits that will be provided to or on behalf of the PIRP Transfer Participant under PIRP-DB (after applying Section 9.14 of PIRP-DB) or another plan maintained or contributed to by the Company or an affiliate
Notwithstanding any provision of this Article or the Plan to the contrary
 the Company and a Participant who would qualify as an International Transfer Participant under Section C.2 above may agree in writing to disregard the provisions of this Article in favor of another mutually agreed upon benefit arrangement under the Plan that complies with Code Section 409A

 but not for purposes of determining such Participant&#8217;s Salaried Plan Pension within the meaning of Section 5.1(c)(2)
 such Participant&#8217;s position on reemployment will be deemed to be classified as below Band 4 (or its equivalent)

 by transferring to a position with the Company in the United States or otherwise (hereinafter referenced as &#8220;Engages in U.S. Service&#8221;)
 (ii) continues to accrue benefits under the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan after he Engages in U.S. Service
 (iii) would have also accrued a benefit under the U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix for such period following when he Engages in U.S. Service (except for the unavailability of accruals under such Appendix for the period a U.K. Participant Engages in U.S. Service)
 (iv) subsequently either &#8211; (A) is localized in the United States as an employee of the PepsiCo Organization
 or (B) terminates employment with the PepsiCo Organization (provided this occurs before the date the U.K. Participant commences an assignment with the PepsiCo Organization that is located outside the United States
in the Code)
 and (v) only after fully satisfying all of the preceding clauses
 is then designated by the Company (in its completely unfettered discretion) as a Covered U.K. Employee and thereby granted a legally binding right to a benefit under this Article F at the time of the designation.  The period that a U.K. Participant Engages in U.S. Service shall begin on the first day that he becomes subject to United States income taxes (his &#8220;U.S. Commencement Date&#8221;)
 and it shall end on the date he is no longer subject to U.S. income taxes or
 if earlier
A Covered U.K. Employee&#8217;s benefit under the Plan shall be determined by calculating
 as of his Modified U.S. Cessation Date
 his &#8220;Total U.K. Supplementary Benefit&#8221; and then subtracting from this amount his &#8220;Frozen U.K. Supplementary Benefit.&#8221;  For this purpose
(a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;Modified U.S. Cessation Date&#8221; is the earliest of the following &#8211; (i) the date he is no longer subject to U.S. income taxes

U.K. law)
 and with such total benefit expressed in the form of a single lump sum that is payable as of the date his benefits under this Article F commence
(c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;Frozen U.K. Supplementary Benefit&#8221; is equal to the total benefit that he had under the terms of the U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix as of immediately before his U.S. Commencement Date
(a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In general
 accruals under the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan for the period after a Covered U.K. Employee&#8217;s U.S. Cessation Date shall not reduce the benefit under this Article F determined under Section F.3.  Notwithstanding the prior sentence and anything in Section F.3 to the contrary
 to the extent a Covered U.K. Employee&#8217;s accruals under the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan for the period after a Covered U.K. Employee&#8217;s U.S. Cessation Date have more than fully offset the Covered U.K. Employee&#8217;s accruals under the U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix (and the excess would have been offset against the benefit under this Article F had such benefit accrued under the U.K. Supplementary Appendix)
(b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In determining the value of a lump sum under this Article F
 the actuarial assumptions that are used shall be actuarial assumptions that comply with Section 417(e) of the Code and
 specifically
(d)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This subsection applies if the terms of the PepsiCo U.K. Pension Plan or the U.K. Supplementary Pension Appendix are amended during a year in a way that would change the results under the Section F.3 calculation
 and such amendment otherwise applies earlier than the immediately following year.  In this case
 to the extent that doing is necessary to comply with Code Section 409A
(e)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the event a Covered U.K. Employee (i) has earned a benefit under this Article F
 (ii) has reached his U.S. Cessation Date
 and (iii) then again Engages in U.S. Service and meets all of the requirements to be a Covered U.K. Employee when he again Engages in U.S. Service
 the foregoing terms shall be applied again to determine if he earns a benefit for the new period that he Engages in U.S. Service
(f)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the event a Covered U.K. Employee (i) has earned a benefit under this Article F
 (ii) has reached his U.S. Cessation Date
 and (iii) then is employed by the PepsiCo Organization in a classification that would be eligible for an accrual under the provisions of the Plan other than this Article F (the &#8220;Other Provisions&#8221;)
 then the Other Provisions shall be applied to determine if he earns a benefit under the Other Provisions for the new period of service
A Covered U.K. Employee shall not be entitled to any other benefits under this Plan or the Salaried Plan while he is a Covered U.K. Employee (or while he would be a Covered U.K. Employee if clauses (iv) and (v) of Section F.2. were not included in the definition of Covered U.K. Employee).  In addition
 prior to the time that an individual has satisfied all of the requirements to be considered a Covered U.K. Employee
 the individual has no legally binding right to a benefit under this Article F.  Accordingly
 for the avoidance of doubt
 at any point before such time
 the Company may take action that prevents the individual from becoming entitled to a benefit under this Article F (
 by deciding that it will not designate the individual as a Covered U.K. Employee
 in an unfettered exercise of the Company&#8217;s discretion)
 regardless of the services performed or other actions taken by the individual through this point in time

 this Article provides a makeup benefit under the 409A Program that applies to certain participants in the Pre-409A Program (&#8220;Pre-409A Participants&#8221;) in lieu of updating the Pre-409A Program&#8217;s actuarial factors for early commencement of Vested Pensions to be consistent with the &#8220;2019 Salaried Program Factors&#8221; (as that term is defined in the definition of Actuarial Equivalent).  In the case of participants in the Pre-409A Program who are also Participants in the 409A Program (without regard to this Article)
 this makeup relating to the early commencement reduction of Vested Pensions payable as annuities is provided under the main text of the Plan.  However
To be eligible under this Article
(a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Who is paid a Pre-409A Pension that is (i) a &#8220;Vested Pension&#8221; under the Pre-409A Program
 and (ii) paid in the form of an annuity commencing as of a date prior to the Pre-409A Participant&#8217;s Normal Retirement Date but as of on or after January 1
(c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Who otherwise would not have a 409A Pension that is payable effective as of January 1
 2019 or later because
 except as provided in this Article
 the only PEP Pension to which the individual is entitled is a Pre-409A Pension
 or because his otherwise applicable 409A Pension commenced payment as of prior to January 1
(a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Single Life Annuity that would be payable to the Eligible Person under the Pre-409A Program as of the Eligible Person&#8217;s Annuity Starting Date under the Pre-409A Program if the 2019 Salaried Program Factors for early commencement applied in calculating such Single Life Annuity (including with respect to any portion of the Participant&#8217;s Pre-409A Pension that is derived from the PEP Guarantee)
(b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Single Life Annuity that is actually applicable to the Eligible Person under the Pre-409A Program as of the Eligible Person&#8217;s Annuity Starting Date under the Pre-409A Program
Such Actuarial Equivalent lump sum shall be calculated as of the applicable commencement date specified in Section I.4 below&#59; however
 December 1
 2019) and the Eligible Person&#8217;s actual Annuity Starting Date under the Pre-409A  Program precedes December 1
 2019
 then the Actuarial Equivalent lump sum shall be determined as of such actual Annuity Starting Date and then brought forward with Actuarial Equivalent interest to December 1
 2019.  For purposes of subsection (a) above
 the 2019 Salaried Program Factors shall be solely the new factors applicable under the Salaried Program as of January 1
 2019 (and no alternative calculation using the factors in effect before January 1

In the event that the Eligible Person&#8217;s applicable commencement date is the date in subsection (a) above
 then the date of actual payment of the benefit shall be delayed to the extent provided by Section 6.6(a) of the main text of the Plan
 and in the case of such a delay
The foregoing Sections of this Article are intended to provide a make-up benefit under the 409A Program for applying an early commencement reduction under the Pre-409A Program using factors that predate the 2019 Salaried Plan Factors
 with respect to a Pre-409A Pension that is paid in the form of an annuity and that has an Annuity Starting Date of January 1
 2019 or later.  However
 no duplication of benefits may occur at any time under the Plan.  Therefore
 to the extent an Eligible Person has received or will receive a 409A Pension that
 without regard to this Article
 effectively provides some or all of such makeup (
 because the Eligible Person&#8217;s 409A Pension was reduced for early commencement using Early Retirement reduction factors)
 or to the extent that the Plan Administrator concludes that providing the makeup under this Article would otherwise result in a duplication of benefits

 the Plan is structured as two plans.  The portion of the Plan that provides benefits based on limitations imposed by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code (the &#8220;Code&#8221;) is intended to be an &#8220;excess benefit plan&#8221; as described in Section 4(b)(5) of ERISA.

 continuing for the life of the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner
 that is greater than that provided under subparagraph (i).  In this instance
(D)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in a form that provides a survivor annuity for a beneficiary who is not his Eligible Spouse or Eligible Domestic Partner.  In this instance
(E)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This clause applies if the Participant will receive his PEP Guarantee in an Annuity form that includes inflation protection described in the Salaried Plan.  In this instance

.  Pensions determined under the foregoing sections of this Article are subject to adjustment as provided in this section.  For purposes of this section
.  This subsection shall apply to a current or former Participant who is reemployed after his Annuity Starting Date and (i) whose benefit under the Salaried Plan is recalculated based on an additional period of Credited Service
 or (ii) whose benefit under the Salaried Plan would have been recalculated
 based on an additional period of Credited Service if the Participant would have been considered a Grandfathered Participant as defined in Section 3.7 of the Salaried Plan if the Participant was not classified by the Employer as salary band E3-E8 or MP.  In such event
 the Participant&#8217;s PEP Pension shall be recalculated hereunder.  For this purpose
 the PEP Guarantee under Section 4.2 is adjusted for in-service distributions and prior distributions in the same manner as benefits are adjusted under the Salaried Plan
.  If the benefit paid under a specified plan on behalf of a Participant is increased after PEP benefits on his behalf have been determined (whether the increase is by order of a court
 by agreement of the plan administrator of the specified plan
 or otherwise)
 the PEP benefit for the Participant shall be recalculated.  If the recalculation identifies an overpayment hereunder
Section 3.6 of Part C of the Salaried Plan
 such Transfers and Non-Duplication rules shall apply when calculating the amount determined under Section&#160;4.1(a)(1) or 4.1(b)(1) above (as applicable) only to the extent the application of such rule will not result in a change in the time or form of payment of such pension that is prohibited by Section 409A.  For purposes of the limit on offsets in the preceding sentence
 it is the Company&#8217;s intent to undertake to make special arrangements with respect to the payment of the benefit under the qualifying plan that are legally permissible under the qualifying plan
 and compliant with Section 409A
 in order to avoid such a change in time or form of payment to the maximum extent possible&#59; to the extent that Section 409A compliant special arrangements are timely put into effect in a particular situation
.  In the case of a current or former Participant who is reemployed and is eligible to reparticipate in the Salaried Plan after his Annuity Starting Date
 payment of his non-Grandfathered PEP Pension will not be suspended.  If such Participant accrues an additional PEP Pension for service after such reemployment
 his PEP Pension on his subsequent Separation from Service shall be reduced by the present value of PEP benefits previously distributed to such Participant
.  Subject to Section 8.7
 a Participant shall be fully vested in his Accrued Benefit at the time he becomes fully vested in his accrued benefit under the Salaried Plan.  Notwithstanding the preceding
 or any other provision of the Plan to the contrary
 a Participant shall forfeit his or her entire PEP Pension if the Plan Administrator determines that such Participant has engaged in &#8220;Misconduct&#8221; as defined below
without regard to whether the Misconduct occurred before or after the Participant&#8217;s Severance from Service.  The Plan Administrator may
 in its sole discretion
 require the Participant to pay to the Employer any PEP Pension paid to the Participant within the twelve month period immediately preceding a date on which the Participant has engaged in such Misconduct
&#8220;Misconduct&#8221; means any of the following
 as determined by the Plan Administrator in good faith&#58;  (i) violation of any agreement between the Company or Employer and the Participant
 including but not limited to a violation relating to the disclosure of confidential information or trade secrets

 including but not limited to violation of the Company&#8217;s Code of Conduct&#59; (iii) making
 or causing or attempting to cause any other person to make
 any statement (whether written
 oral or electronic)
 or conveying any information about the Company or Employer which is disparaging or which in any way reflects negatively upon the Company or Employer unless required by law or pursuant to a Company or Employer policy&#59; (iv) improperly disclosing or otherwise misusing any confidential information regarding the Company or Employer&#59; (v) unlawful trading in the securities of the Company or of another company based on information garnered as a result of that Participant&#8217;s employment or other relationship with the Company&#59; (vi) engaging in any act which is considered to be contrary to the best interests of the Company or Employer
 including but not limited to recruiting or soliciting employees of the Employer&#59; or (vii) commission of a felony or other serious crime or engaging in any activity which constitutes gross misconduct.  Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt
Payment of any death benefit of a Participant who dies before his Annuity Starting Date under the Plan shall be made to the persons and in the proportions to which any death benefit under the Salaried Plan is or would be paid (including to a Participant&#8217;s Eligible Domestic Partner to whom pre-retirement death benefits are payable under the Salaried Plan

 then no amount shall be payable pursuant to this Section 6.1(b) until at least six (6) months after such a Separation from Service.  Any payment otherwise due in such six month period shall be suspended and become payable at the end of such six month period
 day of the third calendar month following such specified date and the Participant (or Beneficiary) is not permitted to designate the taxable year of the payment.  The payment date may be postponed further if calculation of the amount of the payment is not administratively practicable due to events beyond the control of the Participant (or Beneficiary)
.  If a Participant makes an Annuity election described in Section 6.1(b)(2) and the Participant dies before his Separation from Service
 the election shall be disregarded.  Such a Participant may change his coannuitant of a Joint and Survivor Annuity at any time prior to his Separation from Service

 the election shall be given effect and the amount payable to his surviving Eligible Spouse
 surviving Eligible Domestic Partner or other beneficiary shall commence on the first day of the month following his death (any back payments due the Participant shall be payable to his estate).  In the case of a Participant who elected a 10 Year Certain and Life Annuity

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that changes the impairment model used to measure credit losses for most financial assets. Under the new model we are required to estimate expected credit losses over the life of our trade receivables
 certain other receivables and certain other financial instruments. The new model replaced the existing incurred credit loss model and generally results in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2020 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures. On initial recognition

 the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance primarily addresses how to (1) recognize a deferred tax liability after we transition to or from the equity method of accounting
 (2) evaluate if a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill is related to a business combination or is a separate transaction
 (3) recognize all of the effects of a change in tax law in the period of enactment
 including adjusting the estimated annual tax rate

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that changes the impairment model used to measure credit losses for most financial assets. Under the new model we are required to estimate expected credit losses over the life of our trade receivables
 certain other receivables and certain other financial instruments. The new model replaced the existing incurred credit loss model and generally results in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2020 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures. On initial recognition

 the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance primarily addresses how to (1) recognize a deferred tax liability after we transition to or from the equity method of accounting
 (2) evaluate if a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill is related to a business combination or is a separate transaction
 (3) recognize all of the effects of a change in tax law in the period of enactment
 including adjusting the estimated annual tax rate

 will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify
 harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems
 including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. In connection with this plan
 we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion
 including cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 65% of severance and other employee-related costs


 as well as voluntary separation arrangements. Other costs primarily include costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives
 including contract termination costs

 food and snack businesses by: accelerating our investment in manufacturing automation; further optimizing our global manufacturing footprint
 including closing certain manufacturing facilities; re-engineering our go-to-market systems in developed markets; expanding shared services; and implementing simplified organization structures to drive efficiency. To build on the 2014 Productivity Plan
 in the fourth quarter of 2017
 we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2019 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above that further strengthened our beverage
 food and snack businesses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;The 2014 Productivity Plan was completed in 2019. In 2019
 there were no material pre-tax charges related to this plan and all cash payments were paid at year end. The total plan pre-tax charges and cash expenditures approximated the previously disclosed plan estimates of $1.3 billion and $960 million
 respectively. These total plan pre-tax charges consisted of 59% of severance and other employee costs
 15% of asset impairments and 26% of other costs
 including costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives
 including certain consulting and other contract termination costs. These total plan pre-tax charges were incurred by division as follows: FLNA 14%
 QFNA 3%
 PBNA 29%
 LatAm 15%
 Europe 23%
 AMESA 3%

 in accordance with the three-year termination notice issued

 based on existing intangible assets as of December&#160;26
 2020 and using average 2020 foreign exchange rates

 if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment
 the asset is written down to its estimated fair value

 2020
 December&#160;28
 2019 and December&#160;29
 2018. In 2020
 we recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of $41&#160;million related to a coconut water brand in PBNA. We did not recognize any material impairment charges for&#160;indefinite-lived intangible assets in each of the years ended December&#160;28
 2019 and December&#160;29
 2018. As of December&#160;26
 2020
 the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at PBNA exceeded their carrying values. However
 there could be an impairment of the carrying value of PBNA&#x2019;s reacquired and acquired franchise rights if future revenues and their contribution to the operating results of PBNA&#x2019;s CSD business do not achieve our expected future cash flows or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. We have also analyzed the impact of the macroeconomic conditions in Russia on the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia and have concluded that there are no impairments for the year ended December&#160;26
 2020. However
 there could be an impairment of the carrying value of certain brands in Russia
 including juice and dairy brands
 if there is a deterioration in these conditions
 if future revenues and their contributions to the operating results do not achieve our expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions)
 if there are significant changes in the decisions regarding assets that do not perform consistent with our expectations
 or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. For further information on our policies for indefinite-lived intangible assets

 the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States.&#160;Among its many provisions
 the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%
 effective January 1
 2018.&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-bottom:10pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;In 2017
 the SEC issued guidance related to the TCJ Act which allowed recording of provisional tax expense using a measurement period
 not to exceed one year
 when information necessary to complete the accounting for the effects of the TCJ Act is not available. We elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance to certain income tax effects of the TCJ Act when it became effective in the fourth quarter of 2017.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;As a result of the enactment of the TCJ Act
 we recognized a provisional net tax expense of $2.5&#160;billion ($1.70 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2017.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-bottom:10pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;The provisional measurement period allowed by the SEC ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. As a result
 in 2018
 we recognized a net tax benefit of $28 million ($0.02 per share) related to the TCJ Act. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be complete
 additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted our recorded amounts after December 29
 2018. In 2019
 we recognized a net tax benefit totaling $8&#160;million ($0.01 per share) related to the TCJ Act. There were no tax amounts recognized in 2020 related to the TCJ Act.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-bottom:10pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;As of December&#160;26
 2020
 our mandatory transition tax liability was $3.2 billion
 which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. We reduced our liability through cash payments and application of tax overpayments by $78 million in 2020
 $663 million in 2019 and $150 million in 2018. We currently expect to pay approximately $309 million of this liability in 2021.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;The TCJ Act also created a requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries
 known as global intangible low-tax income (GILTI)
 must be included in the gross income of their U.S. shareholder. The FASB allows an accounting policy election of either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or recognizing such taxes as a current-period expense when incurred. During the first quarter of 2018
 we elected to treat the tax effect of GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%&gt;Coronavirus Aid

 2020 in the United States. The CARES Act and related notices include several significant provisions
 such as delaying certain payroll tax payments
 mandatory transition tax payments under the TCJ Act and estimated income tax payments. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on our financial results in 2020

 2019
 a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the TRAF
 effective January 1
 2020.&#160;The enactment of certain provisions of the TRAF resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During 2020
 we recorded a net tax benefit of $72 million related to the adoption of the TRAF in the Swiss Canton of Bern. During 2019
 we recorded net tax expense of $24&#160;million related to the impact of the TRAF. While the accounting for the impacts of the TRAF are deemed to be complete
 further adjustments to our financial statements and related disclosures could be made in future quarters
 including in connection with final tax return filings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-bottom:10pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;In 2018
 we reorganized certain of our international operations
 including the intercompany transfer of certain intangible assets. As a result
 we recognized other net tax benefits of $4.3 billion ($3.05 per share) in 2018. The related deferred tax asset of $4.4 billion is being amortized over a period of 15 years beginning in 2019. Additionally
 the reorganization generated significant net operating loss carryforwards and related deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized

 for which we have established a reserve

 we recognized a non-cash tax benefit of $364 million ($0.26 per share) resulting from the conclusion of certain international tax audits. Additionally
 in 2018
 we recognized non-cash tax benefits of $353 million ($0.24 per share) as a result of our agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013
 including the associated state impact. The conclusion of certain international tax audits and the resolution with the IRS
 collectively
 resulted in non-cash tax benefits totaling $717 million ($0.50 per share) in 2018.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-bottom:9pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;Our annual tax rate is based on our income
 statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies and transactions
 including transfer pricing arrangements
 available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when
 despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable
 we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves
 as well as the related interest
 in light of changing facts and circumstances
 such as the progress of a tax audit
 new tax laws
 relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;As of December&#160;26
 2020
 the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes
 reported in other liabilities
 was $1.6 billion. We accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in selling
 general and administrative expenses. The gross amount of interest accrued
 reported in other liabilities
 was $338 million as of December&#160;26
 2020
 of which $93 million of tax expense was recognized in 2020. The gross amount of interest accrued
 reported in other liabilities
 was $250 million as of December&#160;28
 2019







 2020 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income. These operating losses will expire as follows: $0.2 billion in 2021
 $25.2 billion between 2022 and 2040 and $2.9 billion may be carried forward indefinitely. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if
 based on the available evidence

 we repatriated $20.4 billion of cash
 cash equivalents and short-term investments held in our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further U.S. federal income tax liability
 related to the TCJ Act. As of December&#160;26
 2020
 we had approximately $6 billion of undistributed international earnings. We intend to continue to reinvest $6 billion of earnings outside the United States for the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;foreseeable future and while future distribution of these earnings would not be subject to U.S. federal tax expense
 no deferred tax liabilities with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange gains or losses

 available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when
 despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable
 we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves
 as well as the related interest
 in light of changing facts and circumstances
 such as the progress of a tax audit
 new tax laws

 Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs
 or a combination thereof. Executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one RSU that would have otherwise been granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted 66% PSUs and 34% long-term cash
 each of which are subject to pre-established performance targets. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;The Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs

 lump sum distributions exceeded the total of annual service and interest cost and triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in Plan A of $205 million ($158 million after-tax or $0.11 per share).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;In 2020
 we adopted an amendment to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans to freeze benefit accruals for salaried participants
 effective December 31
 2025. Since 2011
 salaried new hires are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan. After the effective date
 all salaried participants will receive an employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution and will have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. As a result of this amendment
 pension benefits pre-tax expense is expected to decrease by approximately $70&#160;million in 2021
 primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;In 2020
 we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the transfer of certain participants from Plan A to Plan I and to a newly created plan
 Plan H
 effective January 1
 2021. The benefits offered to the plans&#x2019; participants were unchanged. The reorganization will facilitate a more targeted investment strategy and provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. No material impact to pension benefit pre-tax expense is expected from this reorganization. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;In 2020
 we adopted an amendment
 effective January 1
 2021
 to enhance the pay credit benefits of certain participants in Plan H. As a result of this amendment
 pension benefits pre-tax expense is expected to increase approximately $45&#160;million in 2021
 primarily impacting service cost expense. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;In 2019
 Plan A purchased a group annuity contract whereby a third-party insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and administer future annuity payments for certain retirees. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $220 million ($170 million after-tax or $0.12 per share). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;Also in 2019
 certain former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were offered the option of receiving a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant&#x2019;s pension benefit. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $53 million ($41 million after-tax or $0.03 per share). Collectively
 the group annuity contract and one-time lump sum payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits resulted in settlement charges in 2019 of $273 million ($211 million after-tax or $0.15 per share).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions

 tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. This strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are available to meet the plans&#x2019; benefit obligations when they become due. Assets contributed to our pension plans are no longer controlled by us
 but become the property of our individual pension plans. However
 we are indirectly impacted by changes in these plan assets as compared to changes in our projected obligations. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return expectations. Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments
 such as futures and forward contracts
 to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks. Futures contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell securities at a future date and at a specified price. Forward contracts consist of currency forwards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-top:5pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;For 2021 and 2020
 our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 6.4% and 6.8%

We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;reasonableness of the long-term rates. We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure that they are reasonable. To calculate the expected return on plan assets
 our market-related value of assets for fixed income is the actual fair value. For all other asset categories
 such as equity securities
 we use a method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over a five-year period. This has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-top:5pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;Plan assets measured at fair value as of year-end 2020 and 2019 are categorized consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets)

 2020 and December 28
 2019
 our international debt of $29 million and $69&#160;million
 respectively
 was related to borrowings from external parties
 including various lines of credit. These lines of credit are subject to normal banking terms and conditions and are fully committed at least to the extent of our borrowings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;In 2020

 we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement) which expires on May 31
 2021. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to&#160;$3.75 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros
 subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to&#160;$4.5 billion in U.S dollars and/or euros. We may request renewal of&#160;this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year
 which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced our&#160;$3.75 billion&#160;364-day credit agreement
 dated as of June 3
 2019. The 364-Day Credit Agreement is in addition to the five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement) we entered into in 2019
 and which expires on June 3
 2024. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.75&#160;billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros
 including a $0.75&#160;billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on a same-day basis
 subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.5&#160;billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros. Additionally
 we may
 once a year
 request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. Funds borrowed under the 364-Day Credit Agreement and Five-Year Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions
 we may borrow
 prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of December&#160;26
 2020
 there were no outstanding borrowings under the 364-Day Credit Agreement or the Five-Year Credit Agreement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;In 2020
 one of our international consolidated subsidiaries borrowed 21.7&#160;billion South African rand
 or approximately $1.3&#160;billion

 we paid $1.1 billion to redeem all $1.1 billion outstanding principal amount of our 2.15% senior notes due 2020 and terminated associated interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $0.8&#160;billion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;In 2019
 we paid $1.0&#160;billion to redeem all $1.0&#160;billion outstanding principal amount of our 4.50% senior notes due 2020.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;In 2018
 we completed a cash tender offer to redeem $1.3&#160;billion of certain notes issued by PepsiCo and predecessors to a PepsiCo subsidiary for $1.6&#160;billion in cash. Also in 2018
 we completed an exchange offer for certain notes issued by predecessors to a PepsiCo subsidiary for newly issued PepsiCo notes. These notes were issued in an aggregate principal amount of $732&#160;million
 equal to the exchanged notes. As a result of the above transactions
 we recorded a pre-tax charge of $253&#160;million ($191&#160;million after-tax or $0.13 per share) to interest expense in 2018

 we manage commodity price
 foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies
 including productivity initiatives
 global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies
 including the use of derivatives. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and
 in the case of our net investment hedges
 debt instruments. Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment
 while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings. The accounting for qualifying hedges allows changes in a hedging instrument&#x2019;s fair value to offset corresponding changes in the hedged item in the same reporting period that the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to our income statement when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur
 we immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; such gains or losses reclassified during the year ended December 26
 2020 were not material. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price

 we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody&#x2019;s Investors Service

 2020 was $283 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of December 26

 pricing agreements and derivative instruments
 which primarily include swaps and futures. In addition
 risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives
 with terms of no more than three years
 to hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases
 primarily for agricultural products
 energy and metals. Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling
 general and administrative expenses
 depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:3pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.1 billion as of December&#160;26
 2020 and December&#160;28

 manufactured
 distributed or sold. Additionally
 we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries
 foreign currency purchases and foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We manage this risk through sourcing purchases from local suppliers
 negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives
 primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years. Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses on our income statement as incurred. We also use net investment hedges to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $1.9 billion as of December&#160;26

 2020 and $2.5 billion as of December&#160;28
 2019. For foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment

 but not limited to
 interest rate swaps
 cross-currency interest rate swaps
 Treasury locks and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:3pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk. These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances. Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness have been swapped to floating rates. The notional amount
 interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps match the principal
 interest payment and maturity date of the related debt. Our cross-currency interest rate swaps have terms of no more than twelve years.

 we had $130&#160;million of investments in commercial paper recorded in cash and cash equivalents. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost

 2020 and December&#160;28



 we recorded a liability for tax-related contingent consideration payable over up to 15 years
 with an option to accelerate all remaining payments
 with estimated maximum payments of approximately $1.1&#160;billion
 using current tax rates. The fair value of the liability is estimated using probability-weighted
 discounted future cash flows at current tax rates. The significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) used to estimate the fair value include the expected future tax benefits associated with the acquisition
 the probability that the option to accelerate all remaining payments will be exercised and discount rates. The expected annual future tax benefits range from approximately $40&#160;million to $110&#160;million
 with an average of $70&#160;million. The probability
 in any given year
 that the option to accelerate will be exercised ranges from 3 to 25 percent
 with a weighted-average payment period of approximately 4 years. The discount rates range from less than 1 percent to 5 percent
 with a weighted average of 3 percent. The contingent consideration measured at fair value using unobservable inputs as of December 26

Gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to our income statement when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur
 we immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; such gains or losses reclassified during the year ended December 26
 2020 were not material. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify&gt;&lt;span style=color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%&gt;Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price

 2020 and December&#160;28



 we recorded a liability for tax-related contingent consideration payable over up to 15 years
 with an option to accelerate all remaining payments
 with estimated maximum payments of approximately $1.1&#160;billion
 using current tax rates. The fair value of the liability is estimated using probability-weighted
 discounted future cash flows at current tax rates. The significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) used to estimate the fair value include the expected future tax benefits associated with the acquisition
 the probability that the option to accelerate all remaining payments will be exercised and discount rates. The expected annual future tax benefits range from approximately $40&#160;million to $110&#160;million
 with an average of $70&#160;million. The probability
 in any given year
 that the option to accelerate will be exercised ranges from 3 to 25 percent
 with a weighted-average payment period of approximately 4 years. The discount rates range from less than 1 percent to 5 percent
 with a weighted average of 3 percent. The contingent consideration measured at fair value using unobservable inputs as of December 26
 2020 is $861&#160;million
 comprised of an $882&#160;million liability recognized at the acquisition date of Rockstar and a fair value decrease of $21&#160;million in the year ended December 26
 2020
 recorded in selling

 2020 and December 28
 2019
 the carrying amount of hedged fixed-rate debt was $0.2&#160;billion and $2.2&#160;billion
 respectively
 and classified on our balance sheet within short-term and long-term debt obligations. As of December 26
 2020 and December 28
 2019
 the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments to hedged fixed-rate debt was a $2&#160;million gain and $5&#160;million loss
 respectively. As of December 26
 2020
 the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments on discontinued hedges was a $19&#160;million loss

 2020 and December 28
 2019 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was not material. Exchange-traded commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and
 therefore
 not included in the table as of December 26

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]





The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo
 Inc. and the affiliates that we control. In addition
 we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest
 our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. We do not control these other affiliates
 as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50% or less. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions
 we do not have control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As such
Raw materials
 direct labor and plant overhead
 as well as purchasing and receiving costs
 costs directly related to production planning
 inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities
 are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving
 storing and delivering finished product
 including merchandising activities
 are included in selling
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets
 liabilities
 revenues
 expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in determining
 among other items
 sales incentives accruals
 tax reserves
 share-based compensation
 pension and retiree medical accruals
 amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite-lived brands
 goodwill and other long-lived assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience
 as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances
 such as current economic conditions
 and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. The business and economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision
Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December
 resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years. While our North America results are reported on a weekly calendar basis
January
March
June

Unless otherwise noted
 tabular dollars are in millions
 except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts
 assume dilution unless otherwise noted
We are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions)

PBNA
LatAm

 distribute and sell a wide variety of convenient beverages
 foods and snacks
 serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with our largest operations in the United States
 Mexico
 Russia
 Canada
 the United Kingdom
The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2
Our divisions are held accountable for share-based compensation expense and
 therefore
The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no control. Therefore
We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products
 energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling
 general and administrative expenses
 depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore
 the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility

We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage products and food and snack products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers
 which is also when control is transferred. Merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product
 are accounted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded in selling
 general and administrative expenses. Merchandising activities are immaterial in the context of our contracts. In addition
 we exclude from net revenue all sales
 use
The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However
 our policy for DSD
 including certain chilled products
and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly
 our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result
 we record reserves
 based on estimates
As a result of the implementation of the revenue recognition guidance adopted in the first quarter of 2018
 which did not have a material impact on our accounting policies
Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms
 which are established in accordance with local and industry practices
 typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States
 and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally
We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility
 write-off history
 the aging of accounts receivable
 our analysis of customer data
 and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of the global economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic)
See Note 1 for further information. Expected credit loss expense is classified within selling
We are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers
 including Walmart. In 2020
 sales to Walmart and its affiliates (including Sam&#8217;s) represented approximately 14% of our consolidated net revenue
 including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers
We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives
 discounts
 advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf
 such as payments for in-store displays
 payments to gain distribution of new products
A number of our sales incentives
 such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates
 are based on annual targets
 and accruals are established during the year
 as products are delivered
 for the expected payout
 which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition
The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed a year
 and
 therefore
 do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates. Certain arrangements
 such as fountain pouring rights
shorter of the economic or contractual life
 primarily as a reduction of revenue
 and the remaining balances of $299 million as of December&#160;26
 2020 and $272 million as of December&#160;28
For interim reporting
 our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period&#8217;s actual gross revenue or volume
 as applicable
 to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume
 as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period
 any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition
Advertising and other marketing activities
 reported as selling
 general and administrative expenses
 totaled $4.6 billion in 2020
 $4.7 billion in 2019 and $4.2 billion in 2018
 including advertising expenses of $3.0 billion in both 2020 and 2019
Deferred advertising costs of $48 million and $55 million as of December&#160;26
 2020 and December&#160;28
 2019
 respectively
Distribution costs
 including the costs of shipping and handling activities
 which include certain merchandising activities
 are reported as selling
 general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling expenses were $11.9 billion in 2020
We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized software costs include (1)&#160;external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software
 (2)&#160;compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software projects and (3)&#160;interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs are included in property
 plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software
 to 10 years. Software amortization totaled $152 million in 2020
 $166 million in 2019 and $204 million in 2018. Net capitalized software and development costs were $664 million and $572 million as of December&#160;26
December&#160;28
 2019
We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits
 certain taxes and environmental matters
We engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation globally. Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Research and development costs were $719 million
 $711 million and $680 million in 2020
 2019 and 2018
 respectively
 and are reported within selling
Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and
 as a result
 are assessed for impairment at least annually
 using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter
 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment
 first we determine if
 based on qualitative factors
 it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic)
 industry and competitive conditions
 legal and regulatory environment
 historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists
In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill
 an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit
 respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management&#8217;s strategic business plans
 annual sales growth rates
 perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating
 macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic) to estimate future levels of sales
 operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill
 such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital
Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment
 the asset is written down to its estimated fair value
 &#8211; Note 1 includes a description of our policies regarding use of estimates
Pension
&#8211; Note 15. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average; first-in

 in limited instances
 last-in
Property

In 2016
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that changes the impairment model used to measure credit losses for most financial assets. Under the new model we are required to estimate expected credit losses over the life of our trade receivables
 certain other receivables and certain other financial instruments. The new model replaced the existing incurred credit loss model and generally results in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2020 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures. On initial recognition
In 2019
 the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance primarily addresses how to (1) recognize a deferred tax liability after we transition to or from the equity method of accounting
 (2) evaluate if a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill is related to a business combination or is a separate transaction
 (3) recognize all of the effects of a change in tax law in the period of enactment
 including adjusting the estimated annual tax rate
 and (4) include the amount of tax based on income in the income tax provision and any incremental amount as a tax not based on income for hybrid tax regimes. The guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2021 with early adoption permitted. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective in the first quarter of 2021. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.

The 2014 Productivity Plan
 publicly announced on February 13
 2014
 included the next generation of productivity initiatives that we believed would strengthen our beverage
 food and snack businesses by: accelerating our investment in manufacturing automation; further optimizing our global manufacturing footprint
 including closing certain manufacturing facilities; re-engineering our go-to-market systems in developed markets; expanding shared services; and implementing simplified organization structures to drive efficiency. To build on the 2014 Productivity Plan
 in the fourth quarter of 2017
 we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2019 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above that further strengthened our beverage
The 2014 Productivity Plan was completed in 2019. In 2019
 there were no material pre-tax charges related to this plan and all cash payments were paid at year end. The total plan pre-tax charges and cash expenditures approximated the previously disclosed plan estimates of $1.3 billion and $960 million
 respectively. These total plan pre-tax charges consisted of 59% of severance and other employee costs
 15% of asset impairments and 26% of other costs
 including costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives
 including certain consulting and other contract termination costs. These total plan pre-tax charges were incurred by division as follows: FLNA 14%
 QFNA 3%
 PBNA 29%
 LatAm 15%
 Europe 23%
 AMESA 3%

 we recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of $41&#160;million related to a coconut water brand in PBNA. We did not recognize any material impairment charges for&#160;indefinite-lived intangible assets in each of the years ended December&#160;28
 2019 and December&#160;29
 2018. As of December&#160;26
 2020
 the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at PBNA exceeded their carrying values. However
 there could be an impairment of the carrying value of PBNA&#8217;s reacquired and acquired franchise rights if future revenues and their contribution to the operating results of PBNA&#8217;s CSD business do not achieve our expected future cash flows or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. We have also analyzed the impact of the macroeconomic conditions in Russia on the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia and have concluded that there are no impairments for the year ended December&#160;26
 2020. However
 there could be an impairment of the carrying value of certain brands in Russia
 including juice and dairy brands
 if there is a deterioration in these conditions
 if future revenues and their contributions to the operating results do not achieve our expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions)
 if there are significant changes in the decisions regarding assets that do not perform consistent with our expectations
 or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. For further information on our policies for indefinite-lived intangible assets

During the fourth quarter of 2017
 the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States.&#160;Among its many provisions
 the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%
 effective January 1
In 2017
 the SEC issued guidance related to the TCJ Act which allowed recording of provisional tax expense using a measurement period
 not to exceed one year
As a result of the enactment of the TCJ Act
The provisional measurement period allowed by the SEC ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. As a result
 in 2018
 we recognized a net tax benefit of $28 million ($0.02 per share) related to the TCJ Act. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be complete
 additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted our recorded amounts after December 29
 2018. In 2019
As of December&#160;26
 2020
 our mandatory transition tax liability was $3.2 billion
 which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. We reduced our liability through cash payments and application of tax overpayments by $78 million in 2020
The TCJ Act also created a requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries
 known as global intangible low-tax income (GILTI)
 must be included in the gross income of their U.S. shareholder. The FASB allows an accounting policy election of either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or recognizing such taxes as a current-period expense when incurred. During the first quarter of 2018

The CARES&#160;Act was enacted on March 27
 2020 in the United States. The CARES Act and related notices include several significant provisions
 such as delaying certain payroll tax payments
 mandatory transition tax payments under the TCJ Act and estimated income tax payments. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on our financial results in 2020
On May 19
 2019
 a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the TRAF
 effective January 1
 2020.&#160;The enactment of certain provisions of the TRAF resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During 2020
 we recorded a net tax benefit of $72 million related to the adoption of the TRAF in the Swiss Canton of Bern. During 2019
 we recorded net tax expense of $24&#160;million related to the impact of the TRAF. While the accounting for the impacts of the TRAF are deemed to be complete
 further adjustments to our financial statements and related disclosures could be made in future quarters
In 2018
 we reorganized certain of our international operations
 including the intercompany transfer of certain intangible assets. As a result
 we recognized other net tax benefits of $4.3 billion ($3.05 per share) in 2018. The related deferred tax asset of $4.4 billion is being amortized over a period of 15 years beginning in 2019. Additionally
 the reorganization generated significant net operating loss carryforwards and related deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized

 in 2018
 we recognized non-cash tax benefits of $353 million ($0.24 per share) as a result of our agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013

Share-based Payment Arrangement
 Noncash Expense [Abstract]





Our share-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees&#8217; interests with the interests of our shareholders. PepsiCo has granted stock options
 RSUs
 PSUs
 PEPunits and long-term cash awards to employees under the shareholder-approved PepsiCo
 Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs
 or a combination thereof. Executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one RSU that would have otherwise been granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted 66% PSUs and 34% long-term cash
The Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs
As of December&#160;26
 2020
The following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense
 which is primarily recorded in selling
 general and administrative expenses
As of December&#160;26
 2020
The fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period
 primarily three years. Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. In addition
We do not backdate
The expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options. It is based on our historical experience with similar grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life. Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life. Dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income

Pension
 Retiree Medical and Savings Plans

Retirement Benefits
 Description [Abstract]




Pension
 Retiree Medical and Savings Plans

In 2020
In 2020
 we adopted an amendment to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans to freeze benefit accruals for salaried participants
 effective December 31
 2025. Since 2011
 salaried new hires are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan. After the effective date
 all salaried participants will receive an employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution and will have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. As a result of this amendment
 pension benefits pre-tax expense is expected to decrease by approximately $70&#160;million in 2021
In 2020
 we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the transfer of certain participants from Plan A to Plan I and to a newly created plan
 Plan H
 effective January 1
In 2020
 we adopted an amendment
 effective January 1
 2021
 to enhance the pay credit benefits of certain participants in Plan H. As a result of this amendment
 pension benefits pre-tax expense is expected to increase approximately $45&#160;million in 2021
In 2019
Also in 2019
 certain former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were offered the option of receiving a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant&#8217;s pension benefit. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $53 million ($41 million after-tax or $0.03 per share). Collectively
Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions
 including the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets
 as well as changes in our assumptions
 are determined at each measurement date. These differences are recognized as a component of net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss. If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan obligations
 a portion of the net gain or loss is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income for the following year based upon the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A (approximately 10 years) and retiree medical (approximately 8 years)
 or the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I (approximately 23 years). In 2021
 we expect the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A to be approximately 9 years
The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit)) is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service life for participants in both Plan A and Plan H
straight-line basis over the period up to the effective date of the freeze

The net loss/(gain) arising in the current year is primarily attributable to the decrease in discount rate
The amount we report in operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost is service cost
Settlement/curtailment loss/(gain) represents the result of actions that effectively eliminate all or a portion of related projected benefit obligations. Settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan due to lump sums or other events exceed the annual service and interest cost. Settlements are recognized when actions are irrevocable and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for projected benefit obligations. Lump sum payouts are generally higher when interest rates are lower. Curtailments are due to events such as plant closures or the sale of a business resulting in a reduction of future service or benefits. Curtailment losses are recognized when an event is probable and estimable
In 2020
 U.S. includes a settlement charge of $205&#160;million ($158&#160;million after-tax or $0.11 per share) related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest cost. In 2019

Includes $325&#160;million contribution in 2020
In November 2020
 we received approval from our Board of Directors to make discretionary contributions of $500&#160;million to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans. We contributed $300&#160;million of the approved amount in January 2021; we expect to contribute the remaining $200&#160;million in the third quarter of 2021. In addition
 in 2021
Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction with plan obligations
 an evaluation of market conditions
 tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. This strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are available to meet the plans&#8217; benefit obligations when they become due. Assets contributed to our pension plans are no longer controlled by us
 but become the property of our individual pension plans. However
 we are indirectly impacted by changes in these plan assets as compared to changes in our projected obligations. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return expectations. Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments
 such as futures and forward contracts
For 2021 and 2020
 our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 6.4% and 6.8%
The expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset class
reasonableness of the long-term rates. We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure that they are reasonable. To calculate the expected return on plan assets
 our market-related value of assets for fixed income is the actual fair value. For all other asset categories
 such as equity securities
Plan assets measured at fair value as of year-end 2020 and 2019 are categorized consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets)

 and the preferred stock portfolio was invested in domestic and international corporate preferred stock investments. The common stock is based on quoted prices in active markets. The commingled funds are based on the published price of the fund and include one large-cap fund that represents 13% and 16% of total U.S. plan assets for 2020 and 2019
 respectively. The preferred stock investments are based on quoted bid prices for comparable securities in the marketplace and broker/dealer quotes in active markets. The international portfolio includes Level 1 assets of $2
119 million and $1
941 million for 2020 and 2019
 respectively
These investments are based on quoted bid prices for comparable securities in the marketplace and broker/dealer quotes in active markets. Corporate bonds of U.S.-based companies represent 30% and 28% of total U.S. plan assets for 2020 and 2019

In 2020
 we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement) which expires on May 31
 2021. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to&#160;$3.75 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros
 subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to&#160;$4.5 billion in U.S dollars and/or euros. We may request renewal of&#160;this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year
 which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced our&#160;$3.75 billion&#160;364-day credit agreement
 dated as of June 3
 2019. The 364-Day Credit Agreement is in addition to the five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement) we entered into in 2019
 and which expires on June 3
 2024. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.75&#160;billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros
 including a $0.75&#160;billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on a same-day basis
 subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.5&#160;billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros. Additionally
 we may
 once a year
 request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. Funds borrowed under the 364-Day Credit Agreement and Five-Year Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions
 we may borrow
 prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of December&#160;26

 we completed an exchange offer for certain notes issued by predecessors to a PepsiCo subsidiary for newly issued PepsiCo notes. These notes were issued in an aggregate principal amount of $732&#160;million
 equal to the exchanged notes. As a result of the above transactions
 we recorded a pre-tax charge of $253&#160;million ($191&#160;million after-tax or $0.13 per share) to interest expense in 2018
 primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes.

Derivative Instruments and Hedges
 Assets [Abstract]





commodity prices
In the normal course of business
 we manage commodity price
 foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies
 including productivity initiatives
 global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies
Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and
 in the case of our net investment hedges
 debt instruments. Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment
 while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings. The accounting for qualifying hedges allows changes in a hedging instrument&#8217;s fair value to offset corresponding changes in the hedged item in the same reporting period that the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to our income statement when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur
 we immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; such gains or losses reclassified during the year ended December 26
Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price
We perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly
 including reviewing netting agreements
 if any
 and a review of credit ratings
 credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty. Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk
be low. In addition
Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody&#8217;s Investors Service
 Inc.) or A (S&amp;P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of December 26
 2020 was $283 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of December 26
We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders
 pricing agreements and derivative instruments
 which primarily include swaps and futures. In addition
 risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives
 with terms of no more than three years
 to hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases
 primarily for agricultural products
 energy and metals. Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling
 general and administrative expenses
Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.1 billion as of December&#160;26
 2020 and December&#160;28
We are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made
 manufactured
 distributed or sold. Additionally
 we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries
 foreign currency purchases and foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We manage this risk through sourcing purchases from local suppliers
 negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives
Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $1.9 billion as of December&#160;26
 2020 and December&#160;28
 2019. The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.7 billion as of December&#160;26
 2020 and $2.5 billion as of December&#160;28
 2019. For foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment
 gains and losses were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items
We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks
 tax consequences and overall financing strategies. We use various interest rate derivative instruments including
 but not limited to
 interest rate swaps
 cross-currency interest rate swaps
swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk. These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances. Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness have been swapped to floating rates. The notional amount
 interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps match the principal
Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $3.0 billion as of December&#160;26
 2020 and $5.0 billion as of December&#160;28
As of December&#160;26
 2020
 approximately 3% of total debt
 after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments
 was subject to variable rates
 compared to approximately 9% as of December&#160;28
Investments in debt securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. Highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of three months or less are recorded as cash equivalents. Our held-to-maturity debt securities consist of U.S. Treasury securities and commercial paper. As of December 26
 2020
 we had $2.1&#160;billion of investments in U.S. Treasury securities with $2.0&#160;billion recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $0.1&#160;billion in short-term investments. We had no investments in U.S. Treasury securities as of December 28
 2019. As of December 26
 2020
 we had $260&#160;million of investments in commercial paper with $75&#160;million recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $185&#160;million in short-term investments. As of December 28
 2019
 we had $130&#160;million of investments in commercial paper recorded in cash and cash equivalents. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost
 which approximates fair value
 and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Our investments mature in less than one year. As of December 26
 2020 and December 28
 2019
The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of December&#160;26
 2020 and December&#160;28
1
Fair value hierarchy levels are defined in Note 7. Unless otherwise noted
In connection with our acquisition of Rockstar
 we recorded a liability for tax-related contingent consideration payable over up to 15 years
 with an option to accelerate all remaining payments
 with estimated maximum payments of approximately $1.1&#160;billion
 using current tax rates. The fair value of the liability is estimated using probability-weighted
 discounted future cash flows at current tax rates. The significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) used to estimate the fair value include the expected future tax benefits associated with the acquisition
 the probability that the option to accelerate all remaining payments will be exercised and discount rates. The expected annual future tax benefits range from approximately $40&#160;million to $110&#160;million
 with an average of $70&#160;million. The probability
 in any given year
 that the option to accelerate will be exercised ranges from 3 to 25 percent
 with a weighted-average payment period of approximately 4 years. The discount rates range from less than 1 percent to 5 percent
 with a weighted average of 3 percent. The contingent consideration measured at fair value using unobservable inputs as of December 26
 2020 is $861&#160;million
 comprised of an $882&#160;million liability recognized at the acquisition date of Rockstar and a fair value decrease of $21&#160;million in the year ended December 26
 2020
 recorded in selling
Based on London Interbank Offered Rate forward rates. As of December 26
 2020 and December 28
 2019
 the carrying amount of hedged fixed-rate debt was $0.2&#160;billion and $2.2&#160;billion
 respectively
 and classified on our balance sheet within short-term and long-term debt obligations. As of December 26
 2020 and December 28
 2019
 the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments to hedged fixed-rate debt was a $2&#160;million gain and $5&#160;million loss
 respectively. As of December 26
 2020
 the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments on discontinued hedges was a $19&#160;million loss
Derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis on our balance sheet. Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on the balance sheet as of December 26
 2020 and December 28
 2019 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was not material. Exchange-traded commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and
 therefore
 not included in the table as of December 26
The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments approximate fair value due to their short-term maturity. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of our debt obligations as of December&#160;26
 2020 and December&#160;28
 2019 was $50 billion and $34 billion
 respectively
 based upon prices of similar instruments in the marketplace
Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in selling
 general and administrative expenses. Interest rate derivative losses/gains are primarily from fair value hedges and are included in net interest expense and other. These losses/gains are substantially offset by decreases/increases in the value of the underlying debt
 which are also included in net interest expense and other. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling
 general and administrative expenses
Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are included in cost of sales. Interest rate derivative losses/gains are included in net interest expense and other. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling
 general and administrative expenses
Based on current market conditions
 we expect to reclassify net losses of $7&#160;million related to our cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income during the next 12 months.

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]




Consolidation
 Policy

 Inc. and the affiliates that we control. In addition
 we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest
 our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. We do not control these other affiliates
 as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50% or less. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions
 we do not have control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As such
 our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period presented.



Use of Estimates
 Policy

 liabilities
 revenues
 expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in determining
 among other items
 sales incentives accruals
 tax reserves
 share-based compensation
 pension and retiree medical accruals
 amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite-lived brands
 goodwill and other long-lived assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience
 as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances
 such as current economic conditions
 and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. The business and economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision
 actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.



Fiscal Period
 Policy
Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December
 resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years. While our North America results are reported on a weekly calendar basis
January
March
June
September
 October
 November and December







Disclosure of accounting policy regarding (1) the principles it follows in consolidating or combining the separate financial statements
 including the principles followed in determining the inclusion or exclusion of subsidiaries or other entities in the consolidated or combined financial statements and (2) its treatment of interests (for example
 common stock
 a partnership interest or other means of exerting influence) in other entities
 for example consolidation or use of the equity or cost methods of accounting.  The accounting policy may also address the accounting treatment for intercompany accounts and transactions
 noncontrolling interest
 and the income statement treatment in consolidation for issuances of stock by a subsidiary.




























Disclosure of accounting policy for determining an entity's fiscal year or other fiscal period. This disclosure may include identification of the fiscal period end-date
 the length of the fiscal period
 any reporting period lag between the entity and its subsidiaries
 or equity investees. If a reporting lag exists
 the closing date of the entity having a different period end is generally noted
 along with an explanation of the necessity for using different closing dates. Any intervening events that materially affect the entity's financial position or results of operations are generally also disclosed.

We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage products and food and snack products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers
 which is also when control is transferred. Merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product
 are accounted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded in selling
 general and administrative expenses. Merchandising activities are immaterial in the context of our contracts. In addition
 we exclude from net revenue all sales
 use
The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However
 our policy for DSD
 including certain chilled products
and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly
 our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result
 we record reserves
 based on estimates
As a result of the implementation of the revenue recognition guidance adopted in the first quarter of 2018
 which did not have a material impact on our accounting policies
Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms
 which are established in accordance with local and industry practices
 typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States
 and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally
We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility
 write-off history
 the aging of accounts receivable
 our analysis of customer data
 and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of the global economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic)
See Note 1 for further information. Expected credit loss expense is classified within selling
We are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers
 including Walmart. In 2020
 sales to Walmart and its affiliates (including Sam&#8217;s) represented approximately 14% of our consolidated net revenue
 including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers
 which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. We have not experienced credit issues with these customers.



Sales Incentives And Other Marketplace Spending
 Policy [Policy Text Block]
We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives
 discounts
 advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf
 such as payments for in-store displays
 payments to gain distribution of new products
A number of our sales incentives
 such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates
 are based on annual targets
 and accruals are established during the year
 as products are delivered
 for the expected payout
 which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition
The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed a year
 and
 therefore
 do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates. Certain arrangements
 such as fountain pouring rights
shorter of the economic or contractual life
 primarily as a reduction of revenue
 and the remaining balances of $299 million as of December&#160;26
 2020 and $272 million as of December&#160;28
For interim reporting
 our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period&#8217;s actual gross revenue or volume
 as applicable
 to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume
 as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period
 any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition
Advertising and other marketing activities
 reported as selling
 general and administrative expenses
 totaled $4.6 billion in 2020
 $4.7 billion in 2019 and $4.2 billion in 2018
 including advertising expenses of $3.0 billion in both 2020 and 2019
Deferred advertising costs of $48 million and $55 million as of December&#160;26
 2020 and December&#160;28
 2019
 respectively
 are classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet.



Shipping and Handling Cost
 Policy [Policy Text Block]
Distribution costs
 including the costs of shipping and handling activities
 which include certain merchandising activities
 are reported as selling
 general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling expenses were $11.9 billion in 2020
 $10.9 billion in 2019 and $10.5 billion in 2018.



Internal Use Software
 Policy [Policy Text Block]
We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized software costs include (1)&#160;external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software
 (2)&#160;compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software projects and (3)&#160;interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs are included in property
 plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software
 to 10 years. Software amortization totaled $152 million in 2020
 $166 million in 2019 and $204 million in 2018. Net capitalized software and development costs were $664 million and $572 million as of December&#160;26
December&#160;28
 2019
 respectively.



Commitments and Contingencies
 Policy [Policy Text Block]
We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits
 certain taxes and environmental matters
 as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations. We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable.



Research and Development Expense
 Policy [Policy Text Block]

 $711 million and $680 million in 2020
 2019 and 2018
 respectively
 and are reported within selling
 general and administrative expenses.



Goodwill and Intangible Assets
 Policy [Policy Text Block]
Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and
 as a result
 are assessed for impairment at least annually
 using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter
 or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment
 first we determine if
 based on qualitative factors
 it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic)
 industry and competitive conditions
 legal and regulatory environment
 historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists
In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill
 an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit
 respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management&#8217;s strategic business plans
 annual sales growth rates
 perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating
 macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic) to estimate future levels of sales
 operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill
 such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital
Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment
 the asset is written down to its estimated fair value
 which is based on its discounted future cash flows.

 plant and equipment is recorded at historical cost. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over an asset&#8217;s estimated useful life. Land is not depreciated and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service. 



New Accounting Pronouncements
 Policy [Policy Text Block]
In 2016
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that changes the impairment model used to measure credit losses for most financial assets. Under the new model we are required to estimate expected credit losses over the life of our trade receivables
 certain other receivables and certain other financial instruments. The new model replaced the existing incurred credit loss model and generally results in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2020 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures. On initial recognition
In 2019
 the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance primarily addresses how to (1) recognize a deferred tax liability after we transition to or from the equity method of accounting
 (2) evaluate if a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill is related to a business combination or is a separate transaction
 (3) recognize all of the effects of a change in tax law in the period of enactment
 including adjusting the estimated annual tax rate
 and (4) include the amount of tax based on income in the income tax provision and any incremental amount as a tax not based on income for hybrid tax regimes. The guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2021 with early adoption permitted. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective in the first quarter of 2021. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.

 statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies and transactions
 including transfer pricing arrangements
 available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when
 despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable
 we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves
 as well as the related interest
 in light of changing facts and circumstances
 such as the progress of a tax audit
 new tax laws
 relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution.

 primarily three years. Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. In addition
 we use historical data to estimate forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. We do not backdate
 reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively. Repricing of awards would require shareholder approval under the LTIP.

Pension and Other Postretirement Plans
 Policy [Policy Text Block]
Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions
 including the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets
 as well as changes in our assumptions
 are determined at each measurement date. These differences are recognized as a component of net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss. If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan obligations
 a portion of the net gain or loss is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income for the following year based upon the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A (approximately 10 years) and retiree medical (approximately 8 years)
 or the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I (approximately 23 years). In 2021
 we expect the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A to be approximately 9 years
The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit)) is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service life for participants in both Plan A and Plan H
straight-line basis over the period up to the effective date of the freeze
 or the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I.

Derivatives
 Policy
Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and
 in the case of our net investment hedges
 debt instruments. Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment
 while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings. The accounting for qualifying hedges allows changes in a hedging instrument&#8217;s fair value to offset corresponding changes in the hedged item in the same reporting period that the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to our income statement when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur
 we immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; such gains or losses reclassified during the year ended December 26
Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price
We perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly
 including reviewing netting agreements
 if any
 and a review of credit ratings
 credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty. Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk
be low. In addition
 we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.

 resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years. While our North America results are reported on a weekly calendar basis
January
March
June
September
 October
 November and December




Our divisions are held accountable for share-based compensation expense and
 therefore
The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no control. Therefore
 any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.

Derivative Instruments and Hedges
 Assets [Abstract]





The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of December&#160;26
 2020 and December&#160;28
1
Fair value hierarchy levels are defined in Note 7. Unless otherwise noted
In connection with our acquisition of Rockstar
 we recorded a liability for tax-related contingent consideration payable over up to 15 years
 with an option to accelerate all remaining payments
 with estimated maximum payments of approximately $1.1&#160;billion
 using current tax rates. The fair value of the liability is estimated using probability-weighted
 discounted future cash flows at current tax rates. The significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) used to estimate the fair value include the expected future tax benefits associated with the acquisition
 the probability that the option to accelerate all remaining payments will be exercised and discount rates. The expected annual future tax benefits range from approximately $40&#160;million to $110&#160;million
 with an average of $70&#160;million. The probability
 in any given year
 that the option to accelerate will be exercised ranges from 3 to 25 percent
 with a weighted-average payment period of approximately 4 years. The discount rates range from less than 1 percent to 5 percent
 with a weighted average of 3 percent. The contingent consideration measured at fair value using unobservable inputs as of December 26
 2020 is $861&#160;million
 comprised of an $882&#160;million liability recognized at the acquisition date of Rockstar and a fair value decrease of $21&#160;million in the year ended December 26
 2020
 recorded in selling
Based on London Interbank Offered Rate forward rates. As of December 26
 2020 and December 28
 2019
 the carrying amount of hedged fixed-rate debt was $0.2&#160;billion and $2.2&#160;billion
 respectively
 and classified on our balance sheet within short-term and long-term debt obligations. As of December 26
 2020 and December 28
 2019
 the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments to hedged fixed-rate debt was a $2&#160;million gain and $5&#160;million loss
 respectively. As of December 26
 2020
 the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments on discontinued hedges was a $19&#160;million loss
Derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis on our balance sheet. Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on the balance sheet as of December 26
 2020 and December 28
 2019 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was not material. Exchange-traded commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and
 therefore
 not included in the table as of December 26
 2020.




Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in selling
 general and administrative expenses. Interest rate derivative losses/gains are primarily from fair value hedges and are included in net interest expense and other. These losses/gains are substantially offset by decreases/increases in the value of the underlying debt
 which are also included in net interest expense and other. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling
 general and administrative expenses
Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are included in cost of sales. Interest rate derivative losses/gains are included in net interest expense and other. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling
 general and administrative expenses
Based on current market conditions
 we expect to reclassify net losses of $7&#160;million related to our cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income during the next 12 months.



































Tabular disclosure of the location and amount of derivative instruments and nonderivative instruments designated as hedging instruments reported before netting adjustments
 and the amount of gain (loss) on derivative instruments and nonderivative instruments designated and qualified as hedging instruments.




























Tabular disclosure of assets and liabilities
 including [financial] instruments measured at fair value that are classified in stockholders' equity
 if any
 that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The disclosures contemplated herein include the fair value measurements at the reporting date by the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements in their entirety fall
 segregating fair value measurements using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1)
 significant other observable inputs (Level 2)
 and significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).

Share-based Payment Arrangement
 Noncash Expense [Abstract]









































































































The estimated measure of the percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.

























































Expected term of award under share-based payment arrangement

 for example
 'P1Y5M13D' represents reported fact of one year
 five months
