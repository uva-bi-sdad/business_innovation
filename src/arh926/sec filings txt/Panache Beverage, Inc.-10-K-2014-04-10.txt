 our Company
 we
 us
 and similar references refer to Panache Beverage
an alcoholic beverage company specializing in the development and aggressive early growth of spirits brands establishing its assets as viable and attractive acquisition candidates for the major global spirits companies. Panache builds its brands as individual acquisition candidates while continuing to develop its pipeline of new brands into the Panache portfolio. Panache's existing portfolio contains spirit brands and the Panache Distillery
 LLC

For additional information on our business
 including the matters described below in this item
 please see Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II of this report on Form 10-K.





Wodka Vodka is triple distilled and charcoal filtered
 earning it a 90 point rating by the Beverage Testing Institute &#8211; a first for any brand available for under $10. Wodka was developed as an egalitarian brand &#8211; coming from the position that consumers shouldn&#8217;t have to pay $30 for a bottle of quality vodka. This position was authentic &#8211; the brand was discovered by Panache while walking through a distillery in Eastern Poland. Wodka Vodka
 a relic from Poland's communist era
 was government owned/issued vodka. Wodka stands tall in the exploding category of &#8220;quality for value&#8221; spirit brands. It is uniquely positioned in the category as fun
 quirky
 aloof &#8211; all attributes which have been embraced by trade and consumers making Wodka a true &#8220;brand&#8221; very quickly. Since launching in the United States in 2009
 it has been recognized as a category leader by Time Magazine
 the Wall Street Journal
 Bloomberg Magazine
 and CNBC amongst a host of traditional consumer media.

Wodka is produced by Przedsiebiorstwo Handlowo-Produkcyjne Wieslaw Wawrzyniak
 Kalisz
 Poland.



Alibi has been developed to exploit a gap in the exploding brown spirits category &#8211; the need for an edgy
 premium Whiskey that appeals to the younger generation of drinkers &#8211; recently earning it a 91 point rating by the Beverage Testing Institute. Whiskey and Bourbon brands today are largely positioning themselves alongside &#8220;tradition&#8221; and &#8220;heritage&#8221;
 creating brands that look
 feel and are marketing against the classic cocktail era. Instead of appealing to whiskey aficionados
 Alibi&#8217;s flavor profile harkens back to America&#8217;s past when whiskey was served in a shot glass or flask. While it is embodied with a heritage of traditional craftsmanship
 its packaging and positions bucks today&#8217;s category and challenges drinkers to put up or shut up.

Alibi American Whiskey is a smooth 90 proof blended whiskey that contains elements of corn
 rye and malted barley and is aged in first-fill American oak casks and is easy to drink. Since its launch in late Q4
 2012 it has been embraced by trade and consumers as a unique alternative to what already exists in the marketplace.
















Alibi was produced by Caribbean Distillers LLC. In 2014
 Panache Distillery will be producing Alibi.



Alchemia is a premium
 traditional Polish vodka that is naturally infused with select raw ingredients and made in the &#8220;Spiritus Vini&#8221;
 or &#8220;Spirit of Wine&#8221;. The spirit is available in three varieties: Chocolate
 Ginger
 and Wild Cherry. Alchemia&#8217;s infusions are a fresh escape for consumers who have been offered very little from a spirits world rife with the artificially flavored vodkas presently taking up store shelves and back bars. Alchemia has found a strategic niche in the exploding culinary world and is being favored by celebrity chefs and their restaurants. Cherry received a 94 PTS by Wine Enthusiast and was named a Top 50 Spirit for 2011. Chocolate received a 92 by The Tasting Panel.

Alchemia is produced by Przedsiebiorstwo Handlowo-Produkcyjne Wieslaw Wawrzyniak
 Kalisz
 Poland.



The two central facets of the Panache value creation strategy are the growth of existing brand assets and creation of new brand assets to develop inside the portfolio. Panache is committed to delivering on these strategies through innovation &#8211; made possible through the acquisition of the distillery and its capabilities. Using our key industry relationships
 we expect to create true asset value through our investment in Panache Distillery. In Q1 of 2014
 we entered into an agreement with Florida based Premier Beverage Company for our new Old South Shine brand which we believe will result in true brand value from inception for Old South Shine.

Flavor extensions for Alibi will be rolled out in the second half of 2014 while two new brands will be launched in test markets. New brands will include Spirytus
 an over-proof Vodka born from the same grain and process used for Wodka Vodka and OGB (Old Grumpy Bastard)
 a premium well whiskey that will compliment Alibi in the portfolio.

Panache Distillery
 LLC (www.panachedistillery.com)

Panache purchased the Empire Winery and Distillery in New Port Richey
 FL in August 2013 and opened Panache Distillery LLC. Panache entered the distillery business to strengthen its core business offering. The distillery secures brand supply chains
 increases margins and enables easy
 low risk and inexpensive innovation. Additionally
 Panache Distillery offers third party contract distillation and co-packing adding a new revenue stream to the Panache business. Its president
 Jacob Call
 is the former Senior Manager of Distillery and Bulk Sales for the largest distillery and spirits bottler in the Southeast United States
 Caribbean Florida Distillers. The Company has retained the services of a world-class blend master
 Ronald Call.



The Company holds a &#8216;build and exit&#8217; business mentality &#8211; its expertise lies in the strategic development and early growth of its brands establishing the Company&#8217;s assets as viable acquisition candidates for the major global spirits companies including Diageo PLC
 Bacardi Limited
 Future Brands
 Pernod Ricard S.A. and LVMH Mo&#235;t Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A. While the Company&#8217;s goal is to sell brands individually as they mature
 the acquisition of the Panache Distillery and its development will allow Panache to create new brands and current brand extension lines creating a more diversified Company portfolio with more opportunities for both income growth as well as recognition of acquisition by major global spirits companies.
















While our first priority is internal growth
 we may also strive to enhance shareholder value through acquisitions and divestitures
 joint ventures
 alliances
 and other strategic initiatives. On an ongoing basis
 we review our portfolio of brands and evaluate options to increase shareholder value.



Industry and competitive information in this section and elsewhere in this report was compiled from various industry sources. While the Company believes that these sources are reliable
 we cannot guarantee the accuracy of data and estimates obtained from these sources.



The global distilled spirits industry is very competitive. We compete based on taste
 product quality
 brand image
 and price. While the industry is highly fragmented
 major competitors include Bacardi Limited
 Beam
 Inc.
 Brown-Forman Corporation
 Constellation Brands
 Inc.
 Davide Campari Milano-S.p.A.
 Diageo PLC
 LVMH Mo&#235;t Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A
 Pernod Ricard S.A.
 and R&#233;my Cointreau S.A.

The global alcoholic drinks industry is expected to exceed $1 trillion in 2014. Market volume is predicted to reach almost 210 billion liters in 2014
 a 10% increase in five years. Beer
 cider and flavored alcoholic beverages represent the leading market segment with over half of the overall market value. The EU represents almost 57% of the world alcoholic drinks market

The alcoholic beverages industry offers few opportunities for organic growth. The notoriously high costs of distribution and brand building have created huge barriers to entry&#8212;hence the importance of acquisitions. Consolidation continues as aggressive acquirers seek to demonstrate that they can wring value out of the companies they buy
 especially if they have paid a premium.&#160;

The global spirits market grew by 3.2% in 2010 to reach a value of $262.5 billion. In 2015
 the global spirits market is forecast to have a value of $306.4 billion
 which would show a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.7% since 2010. The global spirits market grew by 2% in 2010 to reach a volume of 19.1 billion liters. In 2015
 the global spirits market is forecast to have a volume of 21.2 billion liters
 an increase of 10.9% since 2010. Whiskey is the largest segment of the global spirits market
 accounting for 26.5% of the market's total value.

Spirit sales volumes in the U.S. witnessed healthy growth in 2012. Total distilled spirit sales volume rose to almost 206 million 9-liter cases
 representing 3.6% gain versus 2011 (which saw a 2.6% increase over 2010). And overall spirits retail revenue growth (the combined dollar of off- and on-premise sales) also increased by a hefty 5.4% to $72.12 billion
 an almost $3.7 billion jump over 2011.

The vodka category continues to dominate the spirits landscape in the U.S. The huge segment rose another 6.0% in 2012
 following a 6.0% increase in 2011. Overall
 the vodka segment added almost 4 million 9-liter cases to its 2012 total of approximately 70.43 million 9-liter cases. Vodka now represents approximately one-third of all spirits consumed in the U.S.&#160;


















The Company portfolio of distilled spirits competes with numerous ultra premium
 premium
 low-calorie
 popular priced
 non-alcoholic
 and imported brands. The competing brands are produced by international
 national
 regional and local distillers and blend masters. The Company holds a &#8216;build and exit&#8217; business mentality &#8211; its expertise lies in the strategic development and early growth of its brands establishing the Company&#8217;s assets as viable acquisition candidates for the major global spirits companies. While the Company&#8217;s goal is to sell brands individually as they mature
 the acquisition of the Panache Distillery and its development there in allows for growth into that of a fully developed brand inclusive of a pipeline for production and a creation of more valuable acquisition target.

The Company&#8217;s products also compete with other alcohol beverages
 including beer and wine
 and thus their competitive position is affected by consumer preferences between and among these other categories.



The principal raw materials for the production
 storage
 and aging of our distilled products are corn
 rye
 malted barley
 and sugar for our whiskies and vodkas
 new or used oak barrels
 and plastic and glass for bottles. These materials are generally readily available from a number of sources
 except that new oak barrels are available from only a few sources. From time to time
 these raw materials are affected by weather and other forces that may impact production and quality.

Due to aging requirements
 production of whiskeys and other distilled spirits is scheduled to meet demand in the future. Accordingly
 our inventories may be larger in relation to sales and total assets than would be normal for most other businesses.



The production
 storage
 transportation
 distribution
 and sale of our products are subject to regulation by federal
 state
 local
 and foreign authorities. Various countries and local jurisdictions prohibit or restrict the marketing or sale of distilled spirits and fortified wines in whole or in part.

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the United States Treasury Department regulates the U.S. spirits industry with respect to production
 blending
 bottling
 sales
 advertising
 and transportation of industry products. Also
 each state in the United States regulates the advertising
 promotion
 transportation
 sale
 and distribution of such products. Similar regulatory regimes exist in most of our other major markets.

In many of the key markets for our business
 distilled spirits are subject to federal excise taxes and/or customs duties
 as well as state/provincial
 local
 and other taxes. Beverage alcohol sales could be adversely impacted by increases to excise tax rates
 which are considered from time to time by U.S. states and municipalities and in other key markets for our business. The effect of any future excise tax increases in any jurisdiction cannot be determined
 but any future excise tax increases could have an adverse effect on our business
 financial condition
 and results of operations.



The Company is subject to both U.S. and international laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. In the U.S.
 the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act
 the Clean Water Act
 and Superfund (the environmental program established in the Comprehensive Environmental Response
 Compensation
 and Liability Act to address hazardous waste sites)
 which imposes joint and severable liability on each potentially responsible party. Outside the U.S.
 we are subject to applicable multi-national
 national
 and local environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business.




















The Company&#8217;s key customers are on and off premise partners. With a solid reputation in the on premise space
 the focus in 2014 is on the growth of relationships in large chains and running programs to attract new consumers and cement brands and extend its customers to the in-home consumer. The focus on relationship growth and programming there in is best exemplified by growth of our sales achieved in the Publix Super Market franchise in Florida
 where sales rose from 142 Cases in 75 stores in 2012 to 1
372 Cases in 125 stores in 2013
 and we sold 3
340 Cases to 143 stores (every store in the State of Florida) at the end of Q1
 2014.



The Panache international customer base continues to grow with strong customer relationships in five international markets.&#160;&#160;Investment in the further development of the international business is one of the tent pole initiatives of the 2014 Panache business strategy with a goal of developing an additional three to five markets in 2014. We believe that the growth of one international market similar to that of New York&#8217;s depletion of an expected 35
000 cases in 2014 will allow for positive cash flow
 provide us with a case study value for brand equity purpose and allow for creation for a financing platform.

Advertising
 Marketing
 and Promotion

Panache Beverages continues to differentiate itself in the spirits marketplace through its focus on developing strong brands with true consumer demand. The Company's philosophy has been to find gaps in the spirits landscape and bring products to market that satisfy unmet consumer needs. Most independent spirit companies overspend on trade related marketing. Panache has always believed that long-term brand viability lives with the consumer
 not the trade. While trade marketing and trade support is critical
 Panache has always believed that the greatest support we can offer our customers is through the creation of consumer demand. This approach has been most effective with the critical millennial consumer.

Marketing for our brands has always started with strong
 clear brand positions and personalities
 which differentiate our brands from others in the category and create a true consumer connection. We support the brand positioning with integrated campaigns that include advertising
 digital marketing
 PR and events. The trade is supported off premise (liquor stores
 packaged goods stores) through traditional but creative point of sale programs while the on-premise (bars
 clubs
 restaurants) is supported through a proprietary support model.

Our overall philosophy is to create awareness of our brands that indexes far higher than our spend or our brands' size would indicate. Increasingly
 given the measurable return on investment against the strategy and the impact on the millennial consumer
 we invested significant capital in 2013 into developing interactive applications
 data intrinsic for case studies that will attribute to expansion
 depletion
 and revenue. The allocation of significant resources to high engagement tactics in the digital and social media space is intended to be an investment that&#8217;s value will be used in calculating the multiplicity potential of a brands success in market. As of October 7th
 2013
 ranked 6th overall on a list of 21 of the most popular brown spirit websites. Brands surpassed by Panache's relatively new brand include Woodford Reserve
 Crown Royal
 Wild Turkey
 and many other popular spirits.&#160;


















Wodka Vodka's humorous personality and groundbreaking high quality/low price brand positioning has been well documented in media ranging from the Wall Street Journal and Time Magazine to Maxim Magazine and CNBC. It&#8217;s been credited with creating a new
 flourishing category of vodka built more on &#8220;function&#8221; than style.

Since its launch in 2010
 Wodka has been known for its sometimes controversial
 always relevant billboard campaigns juxtaposing something of perceived quality against something of perceived low pricing. There have been over 15 different national and regional campaigns since 2010. Marketing campaigns such as billboards are geo-targeted toward markets in which Wodka experiences success and popularity. In 2013
 out of home campaigns were executed in New York
 Florida
 Texas
 Washington State and California. These campaigns are developed to achieve significant public relations results and mass awareness beyond the billboard&#8217;s purchase reach.

Looking forward the brand&#8217;s marketing will see its first major re-fresh since its launch with the update of its website and marketing materials. The brand will continue to explore its humorous side but most marketing dollars will shift to the digital and social channels where Wodka will be able to target specific geographic areas to support while taking advantage of the cult status the brand and its creative campaigns.. The addition of a female &#8216;character&#8217; in the marketing strategy and a digital/social application allowing consumers to create
 share and post their own quality/pricing campaigns will be central focuses of the campaign in 2014. On trade
 strong off-premise promotion highlighting the brand&#8217;s personality and its quality for price offering will be a major focus for the business.



Marketing for Alibi launched in the second quarter of 2013 and has been focused on building the brand amongst the millennial consumer through discovery and peer to peer recommendations. Adopting a strategy recently validated in Forbes magazine (Seven Ways to Identify and Engage Brand Advocates 2/20/14)
 Alibi is targeting brand advocates ranging from Whiskey bloggers to bartenders to socially active consumers in an organic fashion and allowing them to adopt and become brand advocates.

The strategy is supported through its proprietary &#8216;Scandal&#8217; application and website and bolstered by strategic investments with Facebook and Twitter as well as community management
 influencer outreach and PR

The brand saw exponential growth in user engagement throughout 2013 as measured by scandal application downloads
 sessions
 web traffic and Twitter data. The investment in 2013 is expected to be realized via the extrinsic value reported by the brand valuation consultant retained by Panache in Q1
 2014.


















Alchemia was developed in response to the exploding flavored vodka category saturated by brands relying on mass produced flavorants and candy-aisle profiles. The brand defines its own category as a premium infused
 gourmet vodka for foodies
 gastronomic
 wine and brown spirits enthusiasts. Alchemia is made in Poland using a handmade
 artisan process that infused ultra-premium vodka with whole
 natural ingredients and has been embraced by the culinary community
 celebrity chefs and their restaurants.





In the first quarter 2014
 Panache launched its first proprietary creation via the Panache distillery
 a 153 proof clear spirit targeting the on and off premise market. With a focus on filling a void in the market place for a high proof vodka
 the brand is expected to expand the Panache tastemaker base.



Panache continues its retention of Engine Shop Agency as its marketing agency of record. Engine Shop is an experiential sports
 entertainment
 and lifestyle marketing agency that specializes in the strategic development and activation of integrated event-based platforms for both emerging brands and globally recognized Fortune 500 companies. With an emphasis on digital
 social
 &amp; mobile extensions
 Engine Shop creates deeper and broader engagement between brands and consumers



As of December 31
 2013
 Panache employed nine full-time employees
 four of whom were in sales. All employees are located in the United States. The sales force in 2013 expanded
 placing full time sales and marketing personnel in Florida
 Georgia
 Texas
 California
 Washington
 and New York. Employees were placed in target markets based on the maturity of the market and commitment from Panache distribution partners. The local teams are implementing our national sales marketing strategy at a regional level with a primary goal of driving depletions on and off-premise while supporting our distributor partners.

In 2014
 the Sales and Marketing force will be mostly focused on growing the off-premise chain business.



Trademarks are an important aspect of our business model as we create
 own and distribute our spirit brands through turnkey supply contracts which also include various third party suppliers in order to get the brands to global market. Having this many organizations involved in brand production and its ultimate distribution means protecting your marks from infringement by registration in the US and abroad. We expect to register our trademarks in additional markets as we gradually expand our distribution territories.

Each of our brands holds a serial trademark number and each is registered to a separate entity. We currently hold three proprietary trademarks
 Alchemia Polish Vodka
 registered by Panache LLC; Alibi American Whiskey
 registered by Alibi NYC LLC; and Fabryka Wodek Wieslaw Wawrzyniak Wodka Vodka
 registered by Wodka LLC. In 2013 Panache IP Holdings Inc. was formed as the holding company for a number of trademarks
 including Alibi Tequila
 OGB (Old Grumpy Bastard Bourbon Whiskey)
 OGB American Whiskey
 Alibi Bourbon
 Alibi Vodka
 Alibi Gin
 and Alibi Infused.


















Panache USA
 LLC
 a processor of ours and now one of our subsidiaries
 was formed by James Dale as the import company of record for the premium vodka
 42 BELOW Limited
 a New Zealand corporation. At that time
 42 BELOW was a publically traded company in New Zealand but lacked traction in the most important liquor markets in the world
 including the United States. Panache provided the marketing solution for 42 BELOW
 and it became a brand available in 19 strategically selected states and was over-performing in top tier image accounts a year later. By mid-2005 42 BELOW was a major player in the business and was being noticed in the United States by major suppliers.

After noticing that 42 BELOW has replaced Grey Goose in numerous key accounts
 Bacardi added 42 BELOW to a list of top threats to Grey Goose in the US. Shortly thereafter 42 BELOW was formally approached for global acquisition. At this stage Panache was responsible for over 50% of the total annual cases sold globally and was among the key driving factors in the success of the brand. These agreements were purchased as part of the sale of the 42 BELOW Public Company in December 2006.

During this time Panache was developing some of its current pipeline brands Alchemia Vodka and Alibi Whiskey with an eye toward developing a value brand
 which became Wodka.

In 2013
 Panache shifted its focus from importer to a 360 degree spirits development
 sales and marketing company focusing on developing brands that fill voids in the current spirits market &#8212; brands with unique brand/product attributes and category positions. In 2009 Panache brought Wodka Vodka to market &#8212; a quirky
 premium vodka with a value vodka price tag. W&#243;dka was a hit drawing the attention of consumer and business media alike for its fresh positioning and innovative business strategy. Recently
 following multiple features in Time Magazine
 Forbes and Bloomberg BusinessWeek
 Wodka Vodka has been anointed as the leader in the rapidly growing 'Cheap Premium' segment of the vodka category. Panache is focused on growing Wodka Vodka rapidly while maintaining the humble
 egalitarian beginnings of the brand. We have recently entered into significant distribution agreements for Wodka
 Old Shine and Alibi American Whiskey. Agreements&#160;include Premiere Beverage Company in Florida and Glazers Distributors in 12 states
&#160;Alabama
 Arizona
 Arkansas
 Indiana
 Illinois
 Iowa
 Louisiana
 Mississippi
 Ohio
 Oklahoma
 Tennessee and Texas.



Panache was incorporated in the State of Florida on December 28
 2004 under the name Biometrix International Inc. On May 30
 2007
 the Company changed its name to BMX Development Corp. On August 19
 2011
 the Company completed a stock exchange transaction with Panache LLC
 a New York limited liability company and in connection with such transaction changed its name to Panache Beverage Inc. to more accurately reflect its business. We currently own 65.5% ownership of Wodka LLC (&#8220;Wodka&#8221;)
 a New York Limited Liability Company organized on August 14
 2009. Upon its organization
 Panache assumed ownership of Wodka from a related party. Wodka imports vodka under the brand name Wodka for wholesale distribution to retailers located throughout the United States and internationally.


















The majority shareholder of the Company delivered 2
560
000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock to James Dale
 our current CEO
 in exchange for total payments of $125
000 in cash; and

The Company issued to the Panache LLC members an amount equal to 17
440
000 new shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock in exchange for one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding membership interest units of Panache LLC from the Panache members.

In October 2013
 the Company reincorporated in the State of Delaware.

Alibi NYC
 LLC (&#8220;Alibi&#8221;) was organized as a limited liability company in the State of New York on May 17
 2007 and remained dormant until it conducted its first business operations during the first quarter of 2012. Effective January 1
 2012
 the members of Alibi transferred their interests to Panache Beverage
 Inc. and Alibi became a 100% owned subsidiary of Panache Beverage
 Inc. Alibi markets and distributes Alibi American Whiskey.&#160;

Caribbean Distillers
 LLC d/b/a Florida Caribbean Distillers v. Ronnie Call
 et al v. Arturo De La Cruz

 Florida
 No. 2013A-2564. In this action filed at the end of April
 2013
 plaintiff named the Company
 James Dale
 the Company&#8217;s CEO
 and William Gerhauser
 the Company&#8217;s head of Investor Relations
 as defendants along with 3 former employees of the plaintiff. Plaintiff accused the Company and its representative of misappropriating confidential information and trade secrets and intentionally interfering in its business relations and sought injunctive relief against the Company to prevent it from
 among other things
 competing in the bulk alcohol market. After hearing only the plaintiff&#8217;s evidence
 and without the need for the defendants to complete their defense
 the Polk County court dismissed plaintiff&#8217;s claims for injunctive relief and indicated that based on the defendants&#8217; abbreviated evidence
 the information about which plaintiff was complaining was not
 in fact
 confidential. The parties have since settled the remaining issues and the case has been dismissed with prejudice without any material adverse effect on the Company.

Pacific Edge Marketing Group
 Inc. v. Panache Beverage

 US District Court for the Central District of California
 Case No. CV13-3957

Pacific Edge Marketing Group
 Inc.

 Civil Action No. 13-cv-04575. After Panache learned that Pacific Edge had changed the trade dress of its Gruven brand vodka to be confusingly similar to the Company&#8217;s Wodka brand vodka
 the Company demanded that Pacific Edge cease the use of its infringing trade dress. In response
 Pacific Edge preemptively filed an action for declaratory judgment in California federal court. The Company successfully moved to dismiss the California action
 and it filed an action in New York federal court against Pacific Edge for violation of the Lanham Act and ancillary state law violations . The Company accepted Pacific Edge&#8217;s offer of judgment
 which ended the case with a judgment in favor of the Company.

Natwest Finance Limited v. Julia Drew

 Australia
 No. 2012/267599. In this action filed in August 2012
 Natwest sued Drew seeking to collect on a debt Drew owed to two subsidiaries of the Company pursuant to a guaranty that had been assigned to Natwest. The Company became involved as a result of dispute over the alleged wrongful termination of a distribution agreement involving Pure Beverage Pty. Ltd
 Drew and Natwest and conflicting claims over the ownership of product located in the UK. In November 2013
 there was a settlement in the case which (a) resolved the dispute between Natwest and Drew
 along with the dispute between the Company (and its subsidiaries) and Pure regarding ownership of the UK product; (b) confirmed Pure's ownership of the UK product; (c) included general releases between (1) Natwest
 Drew and Pure
 and (2) the Panache Parties
 Drew and Pure (including claims under the distribution agreement); and (d) placed on each party the responsibility for paying their own costs. There remains outstanding certain claims between Natwest and the Company
 but the Company expects to negotiate a settlement agreement with Natwest in accordance with the factoring agreement transfer of debt.

Panache was incorporated in the State of Florida on December 28
 2004 under the name Biometrix International Inc. On May 30
 2007
 the Company changed its name to BMX Development Corp. On August 19
 2011
 the Company completed a stock exchange transaction with Panache LLC
 a New York limited liability company and in connection with such transaction changed its name to Panache Beverage Inc. to more accurately reflect its business. We currently own 65.5% ownership of Wodka LLC (&#8220;Wodka&#8221;)
 a New York Limited Liability Company organized on August 14
 2009. Upon its organization
 Panache assumed ownership of Wodka from a related party. Wodka imports vodka under the brand name Wodka for wholesale distribution to retailers located throughout the United States and internationally.


















The majority shareholder of the Company delivered 2
560
000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock to James Dale
 our current CEO
 in exchange for total payments of $125
000 in cash; and

The Company issued to the Panache LLC members an amount equal to 17
440
000 new shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock in exchange for one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding membership interest units of Panache LLC from the Panache members.

In October 2013
 the Company reincorporated in the State of Delaware.

Alibi NYC
 LLC (&#8220;Alibi&#8221;) was organized as a limited liability company in the State of New York on May 17
 2007 and remained dormant until it conducted its first business operations during the first quarter of 2012. Effective January 1
 2012
 the members of Alibi transferred their interests to Panache Beverage
 Inc. and Alibi became a 100% owned subsidiary of Panache Beverage
 Inc. Alibi markets and distributes Alibi American Whiskey.&#160;



In the summer of 2013 the Company terminated its exclusive importation agreement with Domaine Select Wine Estates (DSWE) for Wodka Vodka
 making the Company the importer of record for Wodka Vodka as well as the registered agent for Alibi American Whiskey. This upward integration offers Panache the autonomy to tailor national pricing and programming
 as well as creates the potential to generate additional profit. The process in 2013 of achieving mobility as our own importer was costlier and more time consuming than anticipated. The Development of the distribution network is expected to result in an increase in sales depletion for Wodka and Alibi by distributors in Q2
 2014.

On August 23
 2013
 Panache Distillery
 LLC (PDL)
 a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company
 closed on an Asset Purchase Agreement with Douglas Joint Venture
 Empire Joint Venture
 and V-3 Joint Venture
 LLC
 (collectively the Sellers)
 pursuant to which
 PDL acquired all right
 title and interest in and to certain assets owned by the Sellers located at 11807 Little Road
 New Port Richey
 Florida. This property includes land
 buildings and machinery used in the distillation
 bottling and sales operations (the &#8220;Purchased Assets&#8221;). As consideration
 PDL paid to the Sellers a total purchase price of $4
200
000
 of which $700
000 was paid in cash at the closing and the remaining $3
500
000 was paid in the form of a promissory note (the &#8220;Note). The Note accrues interest at a rate of 6%
 payable in semiannual installments of interest only
 is prepayable without penalty
 and is due thirty-six months from the date of execution. The Note is secured by a first lien Purchase Money Mortgage and Security Agreement secured by the Purchased Assets.

On December 3
 2013
 the Company announced that it was creating two new liquor brands
 OGB Whiskey and Spirytus Vodka
 at its&#160;New Port Richey
 Florida distillery. The Company recently created Old South Shine Clear Spirit and in March of 2014
 Old South Shine LLC entered into a Florida distribution agreement with Premier Beverage Company. On March 18
 2014
 the Company announced the intention&#160;to release an entire line of spirits under the Old Grumpy Bastard brand. The brand's line&#160;will feature premium value expressions of American-made whiskey
 vodka
 gin
 white rum
 dark rum and tequila with a suggested retail price of $15.99 per 750ml bottle and launched late Q3 in select markets including New York
 Florida and Texas. Spirytus Vodka is scheduled to launch in Q2.&#160;
















Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31
 2013 and 2012



Net revenues increased $403
206 or 12% to $3
694
020 for the year ended December 31
 2013 from $3
290
814 for the year ended December 31
 2012. We generate our revenues from sales of distilled spirits. The revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of a sale exists
 transfer of title has occurred
 the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Our sales arrangements are not subject to warranty. Gross revenue was reduced due to sales discounts by $0 and $59
079 during 2013 and 2012
 respectively.

The increase in revenues from 2013 to 2012 was due primarily to successful implementation of our Wodka marketing and sales strategies
 as well as to the continued growth of our Alibi brand in 2013.





Cost of goods sold included expenses directly related to selling our products including product delivery
 broker fees and direct labor. Cost of goods sold was $2
537
248
 or 69% of revenue
 and $2
129
240
 or 65% of revenue
 for the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012
 respectively.





Operating expenses increased 27% in 2013 to $6
214
203 from $4
889
472 in 2012. The increase in operating expenses in 2013 was primarily attributable to an increase in professional fees of $666
968 and consulting expenses of $318
067. The surge in professional fees was due to higher than usual legal costs attributed to the acquisition of the distillery
 defense of Wodka's trade dress
 creation of new holding companies
 the change of domicile of the Company to Delaware from Florida
 the modification of governing documents
 investment into intellectual property
 and the settlement of legal matters and proceedings. The increase in consulting expenses was attributable to non-cash expenses linked to the graded vesting of warrants issued to the financial advisor.&#160;Additionally
 general &amp; administrative expenses increased $261
854 from 2012 to 2013 due to investment in human capital and resulting higher head count
 non-cash stock compensation expense relating to employee stock warrants issued in 2012
 new insurance and pre-launch activity at Panache Distillery in 2013.



The Company&#8217;s net loss for stockholders was $4
582
669 and $3
267
065 for the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012
 respectively. The increase in the net loss of $1
215
604 was attributable to the increases in interest expense and in operating expenses
 which included non-cash expenses of $1
228
500 resulting from the graded vesting of warrants granted primarily in 2012 to employees and external professionals for services rendered
 as well as from issuing shares of common stock. The employee grants resulted in retaining cash and further incentive for a vested interest by employees.


















Cash flows used in operating activities were $5
058
813 and $3
738
579 for the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012
 respectively. Negative cash flows in 2013 were due primarily to the net loss of $4
582
669
 the loss allocated to non-controlling interests of $716
382
 and restrictions on cash stemming from loans from Consilium Corporate Recovery Master Fund
 Ltd.
 which decreased cash flows from operations by $1
342
158. These uses of cash were offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $1
210
493 and non-cash expenses of $1
228
500 related to the issuance of stock and warrants to employees and external professionals.

Negative cash flows from operations in 2012 were due primarily to the net loss of $3
267
065
 plus the loss allocated to non-controlling interests of $620
670 and changes in asset and liabilities of $1
330
073. These uses of cash were offset by non-cash expenses of $744
935 paid for by issuing stock and warrants to employees and external professionals for services rendered and other non-cash expenses of $734
294.

Investing activities provided cash flows of $72
697 due to the sale of fixed assets offset by the purchase of property and equipment. Cash flows used in investing activities in 2012 were due to the purchase of equipment.

Cash flows provided by financing activities were $4
321
788 and $4
311
208 during 2013 and 2012
 respectively. Positive cash flows from financing activities in 2013 were due primarily due to the proceeds of $5
400
000 from the issuances of long term debt partially offset by the decrease in due to factor of $695
820. Positive cash flows from financing activities in 2012 were due primarily to proceeds of $1
147
500 from sales of common stock and net proceeds of $1
916
500 from long term debt financing. Positive cash flows also resulted from net proceeds of $691
027 from factoring accounts receivable
 net proceeds of $417
062 from notes payable
 and net proceeds of $239
119 from related party loans.

As of December 31
 2013
 there was cash on hand of $1
992
008
 including restricted cash. In 2014
 we may seek additional funding of up to $1
000
000 for working capital. The funds might be needed for:



















Launching production and marketing for our recently announced new brands: Old South Shine
 Old Grumpy Bastard (OGB)
 Spirytus;
































Investing in human capital to facilitate revenue growth and increase visibility of our brands
 services
 and assets nationwide; and















In the past we have funded our cash needs with a series of debt and equity transactions
 primarily with related parties. If we are unable to receive additional cash from our related parties
 we may need to rely on financing from outside sources through debt or equity transactions. Our related parties are under no legal obligation to provide us with capital infusions. Failure to obtain such financing could have a material adverse effect on operations and financial condition. For example
 if we unable to raise sufficient capital to develop our business plan
 we may need to:


















































We specialize in production
 development
 global sales and marketing of spirits brands. Our success will be dependent upon implementing our plan of operations and risks associated with that business plan. The key element of the plan is to increase and diversify our revenue streams by strengthening overall market position of the Company as a cost-effective and efficient vertically-integrated distiller
 supplier
 and importer of its own and third-party brands. Demand for our products and services will be dependent on
 among other things
 market acceptance of our products and services
 our brands&#8217; recognition
 distilled spirits market in general
 and general economic conditions
 which are cyclical in nature. Inasmuch as a major portion of our activities is the receipt of revenues from the sales of our products and services
 our business operations may be adversely affected by our competitors and prolonged recession periods. Timing of our achievement of revenue goals will determine whether there is a necessity for a capital infusion.



Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments. We believe that revenue recognition
 the accounting methodology for advertising costs and the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets are the most critical areas where management&#8217;s judgments and estimates most affect our reported results. While we believe our estimates are reasonable
 misinterpretation of the conditions that affect the valuation of these assets could result in actual results varying from reported results
 which are based on our estimates
 assumptions and judgments as of the balance sheet date.



We recognize revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer
 typically when the product is shipped. Some sales contracts contain customer acceptance provisions that grant a right of return. Under these provisions
 customers can return products that are not merchantable and fit and suitable for their intended use
 are not of the same premium quality as products currently in existence
 or are defectively packaged
 bottled or labeled. Customers may also return any product that does not comply with all applicable laws and regulations. We record revenue net of the estimated cost of sales returns and allowances. From time to time the Company provides incentives to its customers in the form of free product. The costs associated with producing this product is included as an expense in costs of goods sold. No revenue is recognized with respect to such product giveaways.







Inventory
 consisting of finished goods and raw materials
 is stated at the lower of cost of market
 with cost determined by the first-in
 first-out method. Inventory consists of cases of bottled spirits
 dry goods and bulk citrus.


















Income taxes are provided in accordance Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 740 &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221;. A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when
 in the opinion of management
 it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effect of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. No provision for income taxes has been made for the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012 due to the Company&#8217;s loss position. The Company has fully reserved its deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the Company&#8217;s ability to generate net income in the future.

The Company recognizes and measures its unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles concerning income taxes. Under the guidance
 the Company assesses the likelihood
 based on their technical merit
 that tax positions will be sustained upon examination based on the facts
 circumstances and information available at the end of each period. The measurement of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted when new information is available
 or when an event occurs that requires a change.

Panache Beverage

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Panache Beverage
 Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31
 2013 and 2012
 and the related consolidated statements of operations
 equity (deficit)
 and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
 assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion
 the financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the consolidated financial position of Panache Beverage
 Inc. as of December 31
 2013 and 2012 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 18 to the financial statements
 the Company has limited working capital
 and has incurred losses from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. Management&#8217;s plans with regard to these matters are described in Note 18. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

In the third quarter of 2012
 the Company entered into a purchase and sale factoring agreement with a commercial factor whereby the Company sells certain Alchemia accounts receivable to the factor. Under the terms of the agreement
 the factor may
 in its sole discretion
 make advances to the Company of amounts representing up to 75% of the net amount of eligible accounts receivable up to an initial maximum of $150
000 with a possible increased maximum of $300
000. In the fourth quarter of 2012
 the agreement was expanded to include Wodka and Alibi accounts receivable with the initial limits of $250
000 for each brand and possible increased maximum of $1
000
000 and $500
000
 respectively. The factor's purchase of the eligible accounts receivable includes a discount fee which is deducted from the face value of each collection. The discount fee is based on the number of days outstanding from the date of purchase. In the second quarter of 2013
 the agreement was amended to decrease the discount fee to 3.0% if paid within 30 days and 0.83% for each 10 day period until the account is paid. Based on this arrangement
 the Company is liable to the factor if the accounts receivable is not collected
 and therefore the Company has accounted for cash received on factored receivables as a liability.


From time to time
 the Company enters into purchase and sale factoring agreement with a different commercial factor whereby the Company sells certain accounts receivable to the factor. Under the terms of these agreements
 the factor makes advances to the Company of amounts representing up to 90% of certain accounts receivable. The factor purchases the accounts receivable at a $500 discount plus monthly compounded interest of 2% of the factored amount for the period the factored accounts receivable remain outstanding. Based on this arrangement
 the Company is liable to the factor if the accounts receivable is not collected
 and therefore the Company has accounted for cash received on factored receivables as a liability.


In the third quarter of 2013
 the Company entered into a factoring and advance agreement with a commercial factor whereby the Company sells its accounts receivables to the factor. Under the terms of the agreement
 the factor may purchase individually or collectively any invoice of the Company if the Company agrees to sell them and make advances of amounts representing up to 85% of the net amount of eligible accounts receivable up to $2
000
000. The factor's purchase of the eligible accounts receivable includes a discount fee which is deducted from the face value of each collection. The discount fee is based on the number of days outstanding from the date of purchase and shall be 2.5% if paid within 30 days and 0.85% for each 10 day period until the account is paid. Based on this arrangement
 the Company is liable to the factor if the accounts receivable is not collected
 and therefore the Company has accounted for cash received on factored receivables as a liability.


The combined balance due to the factors as of December 31
 2013 and December 31
 2012 was $312
500 and $1
008
320
 respectively. Factor expense charged to operations for the years ended December 31

003. Management has taken certain actions and continues to implement changes designed to improve the Company&#8217;s financial results and operating cash flows. The actions involve certain cost-saving initiatives and growing strategies
 including (a) reductions in certain operating expenses; (b) increase and diversification of revenue streams; and (c) expansion of the business model into new markets. Management believes that these actions will enable the Company to improve future profitability and cash flow in its continuing operations through December 31
 2014.&#160;As a result
 the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern.

















PANACHE BEVERAGE
 INC.







In March 2014
 the Company and Consilium Corporate Recovery Master Fund
 Ltd entered into an agreement that extended the maturity dates of the $4
000
000 Note
 the $1
400
000 Note and the $2
100
000 Note to May 9
 2017.




























 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in company reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in company reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management

 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act
 the Certifying Officers carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31
 2013. Their evaluation was carried out with the participation of other members of the Company&#8217;s management. Based on an evaluation conducted by the Certifying Officers
 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)
 the Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31

 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms
 and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management
 including the Certifying Officers
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

. Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by
 or under the supervision of
 the Company's principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company's board of directors
 management and other personnel
 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and includes those policies and procedures that:





(c) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
















Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control
 there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However
 these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore
 it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce this risk.

As required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rule of the SEC
 management assessed the effectiveness of the company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting.

Based on its assessment
 management has concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were effective as of December 31
 2013.


























Item 10. Directors
 Executive Officers and Corporate Governance

Information regarding our directors
 executive officers and certain corporate governance items will be included in an amendment to this Form 10-K or in the proxy statement for the 2014 annual meeting of stockholders
 in either case
 to be filed within 120 days after December 31
 2013

 the Company shall pay Executive&#8217;s estate an amount equal to Executive&#8217;s Base Salary plus the Accrued Rights.

 and Employee hereby unconditionally and irrevocably assigns to Company all right
 title and interest that Employee may have in such Creations
 without any additional compensation and free of all liens
 interests and/or encumbrances of any type.

 Company shall have
 in addition to any and all remedies at law and the right to recover damages
 the right to equitable relief without the necessity of proving damages

 territorial restriction or otherwise
 it shall nevertheless be enforceable to the extent reasonably necessary for the protection of Company.&#160;&#160;This Section shall be construed as an agreement independent of any other provision of this Agreement
 and the existence of any claim or cause of action of Employee against Company
 whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise
 shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement of this Agreement
 in general
 or this Section in particular.




Employee agrees to defend
 indemnify
 and hold harmless Company and its partners
 successors and assigns from
 against
 for and in respect of any and all damages

These consolidated financial statements have
been prepared assuming that Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates the realization of assets and the discharge
of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future.


 2013
 the Company had an
accumulated deficit of $10
366
003. Management has taken certain actions and continues to implement changes designed to improve
the Company&#146;s financial results and operating cash flows. The actions involve certain cost-saving initiatives and growing
strategies
 including (a) reductions in certain operating expenses; (b) increase and diversification of revenue streams; and (c)
expansion of the business model into new markets. Management believes that these actions will enable the Company to improve future
profitability and cash flow in its continuing operations through December 31
 2014.&#160;As a result
 the financial statements
do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the
amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going
concern.




        
          

        
          
            

 (b) the possible effects of such conditions and events
 (c) management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions and events and any mitigating factors
 (d) possible discontinuance of operations
 (e) management's plans (including relevant prospective financial information)
 and (f) information about the recoverability or classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts or classification of liabilities. If management's plans alleviate the substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern
 disclosure of the principal conditions and events that initially raised the substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern would be expected to be considered. Disclose whether operations for the current or prior years generated sufficient cash to cover current obligations
 whether waivers were obtained from creditors relating to the company's default under the provisions of debt agreements and possible effects of such conditions and events
 such as: whether there is a possible need to obtain additional financing (debt or equity) or to liquidate certain holdings to offset future cash flow deficiencies. Disclose appropriate parent company information when parent is dependent upon remittances from subsidiaries to satisfy its obligations.

 2004 under the name Biometrix International Inc. On May 30
 2007

On

(&#147;US GAAP&#148;) and are presented in US dollars.

Accounting
basis

The

were made to the 2012 financial statements presentation in order to conform to the 2013 presentation. Such reclassifications had
no effect on reported income.

Fair

 restricted cash
 accounts receivable
 inventory
 prepaid
expenses
 accounts payable
 due to factor
 notes payable
 loans payable &#150; related parties
 accrued interest
 and other current
liabilities. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either to the length of maturity or
interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in the financial statements.

150 and $0 was held in escrow as collateral for a bond on Panache Distillery as of December 31

742
008 and $600
000 was held in escrow pursuant to loan agreements described in Note 9 - Long Term Debt
as of December 31
 2013 and 2012
 respectively.


Accounts
receivable

Trade
accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect. We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable
based on a combination of factors. When we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer&#146;s ability to meet
its financial obligations
 we record a specific allowance to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we believe will
be collected. We write off the uncollectible amount against the allowance when we have exhausted our collection efforts.



Inventory
consisting of finished goods and raw materials
 is stated at the lower of cost of market
 with cost determined by the first-in
first-out method. Inventory consists of cases of bottled spirits
 dry goods and bulk citrus.

Property
and equipment

Property
and equipment are stated at cost. The costs of additions and betterments are capitalized and expenditures for repairs and maintenance
are expensed in the period incurred. When items of property and equipment are sold or retired
 the related costs and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in income.

Depreciation
of property and equipment
 other than land
 is provided commencing when the property and equipment is put in service utilizing
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows:



    
    

    
    

    
    

    
    


Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement. Depreciation expense
was $5
009 and $6
499 for years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012
 respectively.

Income
taxes

Income
taxes are provided in accordance Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;)
740 &#147;Income Taxes&#148;. A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and
tax and net operating loss carry forwards.

Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when
 in the opinion of management
 it is more likely than not that some portion
or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effect of changes
in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. No provision for income taxes has been made for the years ended December 31
 2013
and 2012 due to the Company&#146;s loss position. The Company has fully reserved its deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty
of the Company&#146;s ability to generate net income in the future. See Note 15 - Income Taxes.

The
Company recognizes and measures its unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles concerning
income taxes. Under the guidance
 the Company assesses the likelihood
 based on their technical merit
 that tax positions will
be sustained upon examination based on the facts
 circumstances and information available at the end of each period. The measurement
of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted when new information is available
 or when an event occurs that requires a change. Tax
years through 2010 are closed to further assessment by the Internal Revenue Service. It is the Company&#146;s policy to classify
interest and penalties on income taxes as interest expense or penalties expense. As of December 31
 2013
 there have been no interest
or penalties incurred on income taxes.

Revenue
recognition

We
recognize revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer
 typically when the product is shipped. Some sales contracts
contain customer acceptance provisions that grant a right of return. Under these provisions
 customers can return products that
are not merchantable and fit and suitable for their intended use
 are not of the same premium quality as products currently in
existence
 or are defectively packaged
 bottled or labeled. Customers may also return any product that does not comply with all
applicable laws and regulations. We record revenue net of the estimated cost of sales returns and allowances. Gross revenue was
reduced due to sales returns and allowances by $6
778 and $30
576 during 2013 and 2012
 respectively.

Sales
discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenues and totaled $0 and $59
079 for years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012
 respectively.

From
time to time the Company provides incentives to its customers in the form of free product. The costs associated with producing
this product is included as an expense in costs of goods sold. No revenue is recognized with respect to such product giveaways.
The Company gave away product costing $0 and $1
440 during 2013 and 2012
 respectively.

Excise
taxes

Our
sales are subject to excise taxes
 which we collect from our customers and remit to governmental authorities. We present these
taxes on a net basis in the consolidated statement of operations.



Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred and aggregated $1
042
284 and $964
442 for the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012
 respectively.

Wodka
received advertising services in the form of out of home media space from a related party who holds a non-controlling interest
in Wodka. The Company recorded advertising expense and capital contributions from non-controlling interests of $0 and $257
944
in relation to this arrangement for the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012
 respectively.

Shipping
and handling

The
costs of shipping and handling are included in cost of goods sold. Shipping and handling charges billed to customers offset cost
of goods sold.

Use
of estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements
 and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Recently
issued accounting standards

The
Company has reviewed all recently issued
 but not yet effective

On
May 2
 2013
 the Company settled its dispute with Incubrands Spirits Group (&#147;Incubrands&#148;) concerning an equity agreement
with a predecessor of the Company dated April 30
 2007. Per the terms of the settlement
 the Company agreed to pay Incubrands
40
000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock and $84
000 payable over ninety days. As of December 31
 2013
 the dispute amount
has been paid off in full.

On
2013 we entered into an agreement with Engine Shop LLC
 having an office at 150 Fifth Avenue
 3
Floor
 New York
 NY 10011
 to sublease administrative space for $5
000 per month until January 30
 2018. We feel this is adequate
for our present and planned future operations. We have the right to terminate the sublet agreement with 30 days&#146; notice.

In the third quarter of 2012
 the Company entered
into a purchase and sale factoring agreement with a commercial factor whereby the Company sells certain Alchemia accounts receivable
to the factor. Under the terms of the agreement
 the factor may
 in its sole discretion
 make advances to the Company of amounts
representing up to 75% of the net amount of eligible accounts receivable up to an initial maximum of $150
000 with a possible increased
maximum of $300
000. In the fourth quarter of 2012
 the agreement was expanded to include Wodka and Alibi accounts receivable with
the initial limits of $250
000 for each brand and possible increased maximum of $1
000
000 and $500
000
 respectively. The factor's
purchase of the eligible accounts receivable includes a discount fee which is deducted from the face value of each collection.
The discount fee is based on the number of days outstanding from the date of purchase. In the second quarter of 2013
 the agreement
was amended to decrease the discount fee to 3.0% if paid within 30 days and 0.83% for each 10 day period until the account is paid.
Based on this arrangement
 the Company is liable to the factor if the accounts receivable is not collected
 and therefore the Company
has accounted for cash received on factored receivables as a liability.


 the Company enters into
purchase and sale factoring agreement with a different commercial factor whereby the Company sells certain accounts receivable
to the factor. Under the terms of these agreements
 the factor makes advances to the Company of amounts representing up to 90%
of certain accounts receivable. The factor purchases the accounts receivable at a $500 discount plus monthly compounded interest
of 2% of the factored amount for the period the factored accounts receivable remain outstanding. Based on this arrangement
 the
Company is liable to the factor if the accounts receivable is not collected
 and therefore the Company has accounted for cash received
on factored receivables as a liability.


 the Company entered
into a factoring and advance agreement with a commercial factor whereby the Company sells its accounts receivables to the factor.

 the factor may purchase individually or collectively any invoice of the Company if the Company
agrees to sell them and make advances of amounts representing up to 85% of the net amount of eligible accounts receivable up to
$2
000
000. The factor's purchase of the eligible accounts receivable includes a discount fee which is deducted from the face value
of each collection. The discount fee is based on the number of days outstanding from the date of purchase and shall be 2.5% if
paid within 30 days and 0.85% for each 10 day period until the account is paid. Based on this arrangement
 the Company is liable
to the factor if the accounts receivable is not collected
 and therefore the Company has accounted for cash received on factored
receivables as a liability.

 the Company issued 710
000 shares of commons stock
and 586

stock warrants from the common stock. The following weighted average assumptions were used in the Black Scholes calculation:

 the Company determined
that the modification increased the value of the warrants by $148
395 and therefore increased Common Stock &#150; Warrants and
decreased Additional Paid in Capital by $148
395.

The Company had an outstanding loan

December 31
 2013 and 2012. The loan balance includes $110
275 that was transferred into Wodka from a related entity as a
deemed distribution. The loan is unsecured
 and non-interest bearing. In order to induce a new member to purchase a
membership interest
 the related party agreed that the loan would not be repaid without unanimous Board approval. In
addition
 the loan will not become due and payable until all of the equity interests of Wodka
 or substantially all of the
assets of Wodka are sold to an unrelated third party.

additional $50

 the loan was
to be repaid within four months of its commencement. The Company repaid the loan on February 14
 2013. The balance of the loan

such
 generally accepted accounting principles required the Company to record the intrinsic value of the conversion feature
as additional paid in capital and record a corresponding discount on the loan payable. This discount was amortized to
interest expense over the life of the loan. The full $25
000 discount on the loan payable due to the intrinsic value of the
conversion feature was amortized to interest expense over the four month term of the loan in 2012.
