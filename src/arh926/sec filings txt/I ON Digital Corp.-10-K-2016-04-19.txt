ITEM
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BUSINESS.

Corporate
Overview and History of Evans Brewing Company
 Inc. (Formerly ALPINE 3
 Inc.).

Evans
Brewing Company
 Inc. (formerly ALPINE 3 Inc.) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 18
 2013. Alpine
3 Inc. was set up to serve as a vehicle to effect an asset acquisition
 merger
 exchange of capital stock or other business combination
with a domestic or foreign business. ALPINE 3 did not undertake any effort to cause a market to develop in its securities
 either
debt or equity
 before it successfully concluded a business combination. On April 4
 2014
 The Michael J. Rapport Trust (the &ldquo;Trust&rdquo;)
purchased 10
000
000 shares of common stock which was all of the outstanding shares of Alpine 3
 Inc.
 and subsequently changed
the name to Evans Brewing Company Inc. (&ldquo;EBC&rdquo;) on May 29
 2014. On October 9
 2014 the Trust agreed to the cancellation
of 9
600
000 of the shares of common stock that it had acquired and retained 400
000 shares of common stock. From April 2014 through
December 2015
 EBC has been in the process of acquiring the Bayhawk brands and related assets
 as discussed in more detail below.



    
    


On
October 15
 2014
 Bayhawk and EBC entered into an Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement (the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;)
 subject
to receiving approval of the independent Bayhawk shareholders who voted on the transaction. On September 17
 2015
 the independent
Bayhawk shareholders approved the agreement by a vote of 251
212 shares for and 1
600 shares against. As such
 Bayhawk sold to
EBC
 and EBC purchased from Bayhawk
 assets of Bayhawk
 including but not limited to: (A) all assets
 including personal property
intellectual property
 inventory
 contracts
 websites
 documents
 and all other assets however delineated relating to the Bayhawk
Ales label (as defined in the Agreement and discussed in more detail below); and (B) all assets
 including personal property
intellectual property
 inventory
 contracts
 websites
 documents
 and all other assets however delineated relating to the Evans
Brands (as defined in the Agreement and discussed in more detail below) (collectively
 the &ldquo;Transferred Assets&rdquo;).
Bayhawk retained ownership of 100% of the stock in Evans Brewing Co. (CA) (&ldquo;Evans Brewing California&rdquo;) which has
the brewers license at City Brewery in Lacrosse
 WI (where the non-craft brands will be brewed
 with the balance of the craft
brands being brewed in Irvine
 California). Based on the affirmative vote by the independent Bayhawk shareholders to approve the
Asset Purchase transaction
 EBC proceeded with the share exchange and tender offer to the Bayhawk shareholders
 pursuant to which
EBC offered to exchange shares of EBC common stock for shares of Bayhawk common stock
 on a one-for-one basis (the &ldquo;Exchange
Offer&rdquo;). Bayhawk shareholders had until December 2
 2015
 to tender their Bayhawk shares in the share exchange. Bayhawk
shareholders also had until December 2
 2015
 to rescind the exchange of shares. There was no minimum number of shares of Bayhawk
common stock that must be tendered for the Exchange Offer to close. At the close of the share exchange on December 2
 2015
 Premier
Stock Transfer accepted on behalf of EBC 4
033
863 Bayhawk shares and issued 4
033
863 shares of EBC common stock upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement by and between EBC and Bayhawk
 dated
October 15
 2014
 as amended (the &ldquo;Asset Purchase Agreement&rdquo;). EBC filed a copy of the Asset Purchase Agreement as
an annex to a combination registration statement and proxy statement on Form S-4. The Bayhawk shares were validly tendered pursuant
to the Exchange Offer and not withdrawn. The asset purchase and share exchange will be treated as business combination as both
companies are controlled by the same management.



EBC
produces and sells premium craft beer including a variety of ales and lagers distributed to restaurants and other retail outlets
in 6 states. EBC&rsquo;s beers are produced in its 17-barrel brewery in Irvine
 California
 the oldest microbrewery in Orange
County and one of the oldest in all of Southern California. The brewery was established in 1994 in a leased building in the McCormick
&amp; Schmick&rsquo;s Seafood Restaurant
 and the first beers were produced there in January1995.

EBC
products include four packaged year-round beers: Pollen Nation Honey Blonde Ale

a Beach Blonde Ale; and seasonals include Approachable Bastard Session IPA
 Stout at the Devil Russian Imperial Stout

EBC
also owns the assets of Pig&rsquo;s Eye Brewing Company
 LLC
 (the &ldquo;Pig&rsquo;s Eye Assets&rdquo;) including the intellectual
property and trademarks relating to original beers
 lagers
 and ales
 including Milwaukee Select and Pig&rsquo;s Eye (the &ldquo;Pig&rsquo;s
Eye Brands&rdquo;). Additionally
 EBC has the exclusive rights to make
 manufacture
 produce
 market
 sell
 and distribute original
beers
 lagers
 and ales known as Evans Lager Original

 and Dead Presidents.

Distribution
includes restaurant and other retail outlets.

In
addition to beer production and sales
 EBC also produces and offers for sale Evans Brewing Company branded merchandise including
apparel
 glassware and other beer accessories.

EBC
has also entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with The Public House SPA for the acquisition of a restaurant business located
in the downtown SOCO District of Fullerton
 California as the venue for the Company&rsquo;s first branded restaurant and taproom
under the trade name The Public House by Evans Brewing Company. Additional details of the Stock Purchase Agreement
 which is expected
to close following completion of due diligence and certain other conditions
 are outlined in the &ldquo;RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 Public
House Stock Purchase Agreement&rdquo; section below.



    
    


As
Evans Brewing Company&rsquo;s first official tasting room and restaurant
 The Public House will feature the Company&rsquo;s beers
&ndash; as well as beers from other selected local Orange County
 California breweries
 as well as food and
 potentially
 occasional
entertainment. Work is underway to renovate and remodel the restaurant
 with plans to open to the public in the first half of
2016.



EBC
and Bayhawk filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;Registration
Statement&rdquo;)
 which went effective on August 10
 2015. The Registration Statement included a proxy statement seeking the
votes of the Bayhawk shareholders on the Asset Purchase Transaction by written consent. On September 17
 2015
 the voting period
closed
 and EBC announced that approximately 99% of the shares that were voted had voted in favor of the Asset Purchase Transaction.

In
connection with the Asset Purchase Transaction
 EBC and Bayhawk entered into a General Assignment and Bill of Sale agreement (the
&ldquo;Bill of Sale&rdquo;) which outlined the specific assets purchased
 as well as an Assignment and Assumption of Liabilities
agreement (the &ldquo;Assumption Agreement) which outlined the specific liabilities of Bayhawk assumed by EBC.

In
connection with the closing of the Asset Purchase Transaction and the entry into the Bill of Sale and the Assumption Agreement
EBC acquired the assets (other than the ownership of Evans Brewing California)
 the liabilities
 and the operations of Bayhawk.
As such
 on December 10
 2015
 in connection with this acquisition
 EBC ceased to be a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2
in that it had assets consisting of more than cash and cash equivalents
 and has a business plan and operations.

Bayhawk
Ales

Bayhawk
Ales
 Inc. (formerly Orange County Brewing Company) (&ldquo;Bayhawk&rdquo;) was formed in February 1994 for the purpose of developing
and operating one or more breweries in California for the production of high quality
 hand-crafted ales for sale in bottle and
draft. The Company built a 17-barrel showcase brewery (the &quot;Southern California Brewery&quot;) in a leased building in the
McCormick &amp; Schmick&rsquo;s Seafood Restaurant in Irvine
 California. The Southern California Brewery
 located in the central
business district of Irvine near John Wayne International Airport
 began brewing beer in January 1995. Irvine is south of Los
Angeles and is adjacent to Newport Beach. It is a suburban city of the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area and the location
of numerous businesses. At the time of the construction of the Southern California Brewery
 the Los Angeles metropolitan area
was the largest single market for beer in the United States. The products produced by Bayhawk are 90% private labeled. The business
has only recently in the last few years become profitable.

Evans
Brewing Company
 Inc. (Formerly ALPINE 3
 Inc.) was incorporated in Delaware in June 18
 2013 with a fiscal year
ending on December 31st.

Principal

a Beach Blonde Ale; and seasonals include Approachable Bastard Session IPA

 Evans Brewing California
had acquired from City Brewing Company
 LLC (&ldquo;City Brewing&rdquo;) the assets of Pig&rsquo;s Eye Brewing Company
 LLC
 (the
&ldquo;Pig&rsquo;s Eye Assets&rdquo;) including the intellectual property and trademarks relating to original beers
 lagers
 and
ales
 including Milwaukee Select and Pig&rsquo;s Eye (the &ldquo;Pig&rsquo;s Eye Brands&rdquo;). Additionally

had the exclusive rights to make
 manufacture

 market
 sell
 and distribute original beers
 lagers
 and ales known as
Evans Lager Original
 Evans Lager Black
 Evans Lager Light
 Bad Kat Ice
 and Dead Presidents.



    
    


EBC
products are distributed to a variety of restaurants and retail outlets. With the anticipated opening of the Company&rsquo;s first
branded restaurant and taproom in the first half of 2016
 the Company will sell food as well as its core beer products.

Seasonality
of Business

EBC
products are sold throughout the year with the summer and fall seasons of the year providing the largest volume of sales. With
the anticipated opening of the Company&rsquo;s first branded restaurant and taproom
 The Public House by Evans Brewing Company
in the first half of 2016 and additional distribution in year-round retail outlets
 the Company anticipates an increase in sales
in the winter and spring seasons in proportion to the larger volume seasons of summer and fall.



As
of the date of this Report
 EBC had five full time and two part time employees.

RECENT
DEVELOPMENTS

Closing
of Asset Purchase Transaction

On
December 10
 2015
 EBC completed the previously announced acquisition of the assets and liabilities of Bayhawk
 pursuant to an
Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement between EBC and Bayhawk
 dated October 15
 2014 (subsequently amended and restated
on August 6
 2015 (as amended
 the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;)).

Pursuant
to the Agreement
 Bayhawk had agreed to sell
 and EBC had agreed to purchase
 substantially all of Bayhawk&rsquo;s assets
 as
well as its liabilities (collectively
 the &ldquo;Asset Purchase Transaction&rdquo;). The assets and liabilities of Bayhawk include
personal property
 intellectual property
 inventory
 selected distribution contracts
 websites
 documents
 and all other assets
however delineated relating to the Bayhawk Ales labels; and (B) all assets
 including personal property
 intellectual property
inventory
 contracts
 websites
 documents
 and all other assets however delineated relating to the Evans Brands (collectively
the &ldquo;Transferred Assets&rdquo;)
 and the assumption by EBC
 pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement
of all of the liabilities of Bayhawk (the &ldquo;Assumed Liabilities&rdquo;). (The &ldquo;Evans Brands&rdquo; include the former
assets of Pig&rsquo;s Eye Brewing Company
 including its original beers
 lagers and ales (&ldquo;Pig&rsquo;s Eye Brands&rdquo;)
as well as Evans Lager Original
 Evans Lager Black
 Evans Lager Light
 Bad Kat Ice
 and Dead Presidents.) Pursuant to the Agreement
EBC has the right to purchase from Bayhawk 100% ownership in Evans Brewing California.

Pursuant
to the Agreement
 EBC and Bayhawk agreed to seek approval of the shareholders of Bayhawk relating to the Asset Purchase Transaction.
Because the principal majority stockholders of Bayhawk are also significant stockholders of EBC
 Bayhawk and EBC agreed to proceed
with the Asset Purchase Transaction if it was approved by the holders of at least a majority of the Independent Shares (i.e. shares
not held by Bayhawk&rsquo;s majority shareholder
 The Michael J. Rapport Trust
 or by Evan Rapport
 who is an officer of EBC and
the son of Michael Rapport) that actually vote on the Asset Purchase Transaction proposal.

EBC
and Bayhawk filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;Registration
Statement&rdquo;)
 which went effective on August 10
 2015. The Registration Statement included a proxy statement seeking the
votes of the Bayhawk shareholders on the Asset Purchase Transaction by written consent. On September 17
 2015
 the voting period
closed
 and EBC announced that approximately 99% of the shares that were voted had voted in favor of the Asset Purchase Transaction.

In
connection with the Asset Purchase Transaction
 EBC and Bayhawk entered into a General Assignment and Bill of Sale agreement (the
&ldquo;Bill of Sale&rdquo;) which outlined the specific assets purchased
 as well as an Assignment and Assumption of Liabilities
agreement (the &ldquo;Assumption Agreement) which outlined the specific liabilities of Bayhawk assumed by EBC.



    
    


Equipment
Lease to Bayhawk

Following
the closing of the Asset Purchase Transaction
 EBC entered into an equipment lease (the &ldquo;Equipment Lease&rdquo;) with Bayhawk
pursuant to which EBC leased the brewing equipment to Bayhawk. The Equipment Lease was effective as of December 1
 2015
 and continues
month to month. Bayhawk agreed to pay a minimum of $15
000 per month or net profits from operations
 whichever is greater. The
title to the leased equipment will remain with EBC
 and EBC has the right to inspect the equipment and its usage.

The
foregoing summaries of the terms and conditions of the Bill of Sale
 the Assumption Agreement
 and the Equipment Lease (collectively
the &ldquo;Ancillary Agreements&rdquo;) do not purport to be complete
 and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
full text of the specific Ancillary Agreement
 each of which was attached as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K
 filed
by EBC on December 15
 2015.

Change
in Shell Company Status

In
connection with the closing of the Asset Purchase Transaction and the entry into the Bill of Sale and the Assumption Agreement
EBC acquired the assets (other than the ownership of Evans Brewing California)
 the liabilities
 and the operations of Bayhawk.
As such
 on December 10
 2015
 in connection with this acquisition
 EBC ceased to be a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2
in that it has assets consisting of more than cash and cash equivalents
 and has a business plan and operations.

Share
Exchange

As
discussed in more detail above and below in this Annual Report
 as partial consideration for the purchase of the Transferred Assets
and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities
 EBC agreed to offer to exchange shares of EBC common stock for all shares of Bayhawk
common stock that were tendered in connection with such offer
 the transaction being referred to as the &ldquo;Share Exchange.&rdquo;
The ratio of the share exchange is one (1) share of EBC common stock for each one (1) share of Bayhawk common stock.

Based
on the affirmative vote by the independent Bayhawk shareholders to approve the Asset Purchase transaction
 EBC proceeded with
the share exchange and tender offer to the Bayhawk shareholders
 pursuant to which EBC offered to exchange shares of EBC common
stock for shares of Bayhawk common stock
 on a one-for-one basis (the &ldquo;Exchange Offer&rdquo;). Bayhawk shareholders had
until December 2
 2015
 to tender their Bayhawk shares in the share exchange. Bayhawk shareholders also had until December 2
2015
 to rescind the exchange of shares. There was no minimum number of shares of Bayhawk common stock that must be tendered for
the Exchange Offer to close. At the close of the share exchange on December 2
 2015
 Premier Stock Transfer accepted on behalf
of EBC 4
033
863 Bayhawk shares and issued 4
033
863 shares of EBC common stock upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement by and between EBC and Bayhawk
 dated October 15
 2014
 as amended (the
&ldquo;Asset Purchase Agreement&rdquo;). EBC filed a copy of the Asset Purchase Agreement as an annex to a combination registration
statement and proxy statement on Form S-4. The Bayhawk shares were validly tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer and not withdrawn.
The asset purchase and share exchange will be treated as business combination as both companies are controlled by the same management.

No
Change of Control

In
connection with the Asset Purchase Transaction
 there was no change in control of EBC. The officers and directors of EBC did not
change
 and the majority ownership of EBC did not change.

As
noted
 prior to the closing of the Share Exchange
 there was no way to determine how many shares of Bayhawk common stock will
be exchanged for shares of EBC common stock. Nevertheless
 Michael J. Rapport owns
 through The Michael J. Rapport Trust
 a majority
of the outstanding common stock of both EBC and Bayhawk. As such
 following the closing of the Share Exchange
 Mr. Rapport continued
to own a majority of the common stock of EBC
 and as such
 there was no change in control of EBC.



    
    


Public
House Stock Purchase Agreement

Additionally
on December 10
 2015
 EBC entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the &ldquo;Public House SPA&rdquo;) with Michael J. Rapport
as the sole shareholder of EBC Public House
 Inc.
 a California corporation (&ldquo;Public House&rdquo;)
 for the purchase by
EBC of 100% of the outstanding shares of Public House from Mr. Rapport
 with the transaction to be closed following completion
of due diligence and certain other conditions outlined below.

By
way of background
 Mr. Rapport formed Public House to purchase a restaurant business located in Fullerton
 California (previously
operated as Steamers Jazz Club). Public House is working to renovate and remodel the restaurant
 with plans to open in the first
half of 2016. Mr. Rapport was the sole shareholder of Public House.

Pursuant
to the Public House SPA
 EBC agreed to issue 1
000
000 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock (see description below) in exchange
for 100% of the outstanding stock of Public House (the &ldquo;Public House Shares&rdquo;). The parties anticipate the closing
of the transaction once the following conditions
 among others
 have been met:

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public
House shall have received all food and beverage licenses
 including California Alcoholic Beverage Control licenses
 required for
the operation of the business;

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
renovations and remodeling of the restaurant shall have been completed and the restaurant shall be open for business; and

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other
standard closing conditions.

The
foregoing summary of the terms and conditions of the Public House SPA does not purport to be complete
 and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the Public House SPA
 was attached as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K
 filed
by EBC on December 15
 2015.

EBC

Certificate
of Designation &ndash; Series A Convertible Preferred Stock

In
connection with the Public House SPA
 on December 10
 2015
 the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors approved and adopted a Certificate
of Designation of Rights and Preferences for Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the &ldquo;Certificate of Designation&rdquo;).
On December 11
 2015
 the Company filed with the State of Delaware the Certificate of Designation
 which became part of the Company&rsquo;s
Certificate of Incorporation
 as amended to date.

Pursuant
to the Certificate of Designation
 the Company is authorized to issue up to 2
000
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock (the &ldquo;Preferred Stock&rdquo;). As noted above
 the Company agreed to issue 1
000
000 shares of the Preferred
Stock to Mr. Rapport upon the closing of the purchase of the Public House Shares. The rights and preferences of the Preferred
Stock include the following:


Stated
                                         Value: The Preferred Stock has a stated value (the &ldquo;Stated Value&rdquo;) of $1.00
                                         per share.

Dividends:
                                         Holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends equal to five percent
                                         (5%) per annum
 payable quarterly in arrears. The dividends may be paid in cash or shares
                                         of the Company&rsquo;s common stock
 at the option of the holder.

Voting
                                         Rights: The holder of the Preferred Stock has the right to one vote for each share of
                                         common stock into which the Preferred Stock could be converted.

Conversion:
                                         The Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holder into shares of the Company&rsquo;s
                                         common stock. The number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion shall be
                                         determined by dividing the number of shares of Preferred Stock by the applicable Conversion
                                         Price
 which is defined as follows:

If
                                         the Common Stock of the Company has been listed for trading on a public exchange or trading
                                         facility
 the conversion price for each share of Preferred Stock on any conversion date
                                         shall be the lower of (I) seventy percent (70%) of the two (2) lowest closing bid prices
                                         over the sixty trading days prior to the conversion date
 or (II) the Stated Value of
                                         the Preferred Stock.



    
    



If
                                         the Common Stock of the Company is not trading on the conversion date
 the conversion
                                         price shall be the Stated Value of the Preferred Stock.

Redemption:
                                         The Company has the obligation to redeem the unconverted shares of Preferred Stock from
                                         the holder as follows:

The
                                         Company shall have the obligation
 as set forth herein
 to redeem the unconverted shares
                                         of the Preferred Stock at a price equal to the Redemption Price (defined below) as follows:

The
                                         Company shall pay to the holder of the Preferred Stock
 on a quarterly basis
 within
                                         thirty (30) days of the end of each fiscal quarter
 an amount equal to twenty percent
                                         (20%) of the excess revenues
 as determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly
                                         basis
 to redeem shares of Preferred Stock.

The
                                         Company shall also pay to the holder of the Preferred Stock
 an amount equal to 20% of
                                         any capital raised by the Company in connection with offerings of the Company&rsquo;s
                                         securities (whether private offerings or public offerings)
 within ten (10) days of the
                                         closing of each such offering
 to redeem shares of Preferred Stock.

The
                                         &ldquo;Redemption Price&rdquo; shall be equal to the Stated Value of such shares of Preferred
                                         Stock
 plus all accrued and unpaid dividends on the shares to be redeemed.

Liquidation:
                                         Upon any liquidation
 dissolution or winding-up of the Company
 whether voluntary or
                                         involuntary (a &ldquo;Liquidation&rdquo;)
 the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be
                                         entitled to receive out of the assets of the Company
 whether such assets are capital
                                         or surplus
 for each share of Preferred Stock an amount equal to the Stated Value plus
                                         all accrued but unpaid dividends per share
 and all other amounts in respect thereof
                                         then due and payable before any distribution or payment shall be made to the holders
                                         of any Junior Securities.

EBC
anticipates that its issuances of shares of Preferred Stock in connection with the purchase of the Public House Shares
 which
will occur upon closing of that transaction
 will be made without registration under the securities Act of 1933 (the &ldquo;1933
Act&rdquo;) in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the 1933 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

The
foregoing summary of the terms and conditions of the Certificate of Designation does not purport to be complete
 and is qualified
in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Certificate of Designation
 was attached as an exhibit to a Current Report
on Form 8-K
 filed by EBC on December 15
 2015.

ITEM
1A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RISK FACTORS.

Because
of the following factors
 as well as other factors affecting the Company&rsquo;s financial condition and operating results
 past
financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance
 and investors should not use
historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.

You
should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this report before
making an investment decision with regard to our securities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The statements contained in or incorporated herein that
are not historic facts are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results
to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually
occurs
 our business
 financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. In that case
 you may lose all or part of
your investment.

RISKS
ASSOCIATED WITH OUR COMPANY:

We
are an &ldquo;emerging growth company
&rdquo; and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to &ldquo;emerging growth companies&rdquo;
could make our common stock less attractive to investors.

We
are an &ldquo;emerging growth company
&rdquo; as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company
 we
may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that
are not emerging growth companies
 including
 but not limited to
 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements
of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports
and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory &ldquo;say-on-pay&rdquo; votes on executive compensation
and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation. We will remain an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; until
the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1&nbsp;billion or more;
(ii) the last date of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common stock under the
current registration (iii) the date on which we have
 during the previous three-year period
 issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible
debt; and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a &ldquo;large accelerated filer&rdquo; under the Exchange Act. We will be
deemed a large accelerated filer on the first day of the fiscal year after the market value of our common equity held by non-affiliates
exceeds $700 million
 measured on October 31.



    
    


We
cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive to the extent we rely on the exemptions available to emerging
growth companies. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result
 there may be a less active trading market
for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.

In
addition
 Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition
period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An emerging
growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to
private companies.

A
Company that elects to be treated as an emerging growth company shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the
earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1
000
000
000 (as indexed
for inflation)
 (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common stock
under the current registration; (iii) the date on which it has
 during the previous 3-year period
 issued more than $1
000
000
000
in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which is deemed to be a &lsquo;large accelerated filer&rsquo; as defined by the SEC
which would generally occur upon it attaining a public float of at least $700 million.

We
have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2)
of the Jobs Act
 that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates
for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election
 our financial
statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.

Management
of EBC cannot guarantee that EBC will generate revenues which could result in a total loss of the value of your investment if
it is unsuccessful in its business plans.

While
Evans Brewing California
 a California corporation which is a separate entity from EBC
 and Bayhawk have generated revenues during
their history
 which are reported in the financial statements included in this current annual report
 there can be no assurance
that EBC will continue to generate revenues or that revenues will be sufficient to maintain its business following the Asset Purchase
Transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result
 you could lose all of your investment if EBC is not successful in its proposed business plans.

EBC&rsquo;s
needs could exceed the amount of time or level of experience our officers and directors may have.&nbsp;&nbsp;EBC will be dependent
on key executives
 and the loss of the services of the current officers and directors could severely impact EBC&rsquo;s business
operations.

EBC&rsquo;s
business plan does not provide for the hiring of any additional employees other than outlined in its plan of operations until
sales will support the expense.&nbsp;&nbsp;Until that time the responsibility of developing EBC&rsquo;s business
 the offering
and selling of the shares based on current filings and the reporting requirements of a public company will fall upon the two officers
and the directors.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event they are unable to fulfill any aspect of their duties to EBC
 it may experience a shortfall
or complete lack of sales resulting in little or no profits and eventual closure of our business.

Additionally
the management of future growth will require
 among other things
 continued development of EBC&rsquo;s financial and management
controls and management information systems
 stringent control of costs
 increased marketing activities
 and the ability to attract
and retain qualified management
 research
 and marketing personnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of key executives or&nbsp;the failure
to hire qualified replacement personnel would compromise EBC&rsquo;s ability to generate revenues or&nbsp;otherwise have a material
adverse effect on EBC.&nbsp;&nbsp;There can be no assurance that EBC will be able&nbsp;to successfully attract and retain skilled
and experienced personnel but every effort will be made to do so.



    
    


As
of the date of this current annual report
 Evans Brewing California had been operated previously as a private company. Additionally
Bayhawk previously filed public reports with the SEC
 but ceased making the required filings in 1999. Current management of both
of these entities has limited experience in complying with public company reporting and other obligations. Taking steps to comply
with these requirements will increase our costs and require additional management resources
 and does not ensure that we will
be able to satisfy them.

Prior
to the transactions described in this Annual Report
 the operations of Evans Brewing California were conducted as a private company.
Additionally
 Bayhawk previously operated as a public company
 and filed reports with the SEC. However
 under prior management
Bayhawk ceased making the required filings in 1999
 and has not filed any required public reports since 1999.&nbsp;&nbsp;Current
Bayhawk management was not involved in the determination in 1999 to cease making the required filings
 and has not filed periodic
reports on behalf of Bayhawk since becoming involved with Bayhawk. (Bayhawk&rsquo;s filing history is discussed in more detail
below.) Upon the closing of the Asset Purchase Transaction
 assuming the Bayhawk shareholders provide the required approval
 EBC
will acquire the assets and liabilities of Bayhawk (including the assets of Evans Brewing Calfornia)
 and EBC will become the
operating company. EBC is a public reporting company.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a public company commencing commercial operations
 we will
be required to comply with applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 as well as other federal securities laws
and rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and the various exchanges and trading facilities where our common stock may trade
which will result in significant initial and continuing legal
 accounting
 administrative and other costs and expenses. These
rules and requirements impose certain corporate governance requirements relating to director independence
 filing and distributing
annual and interim reports
 stockholder meetings
 approvals and voting
 soliciting proxies
 conflicts of interest
 and&nbsp;codes
of conduct
 depending on where our shares trade. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of
time to ensure that we comply with all applicable requirements.

As
we review our internal controls and procedures
 we may determine that they are ineffective or have material weaknesses
 which
could impact the market&rsquo;s acceptance of our filings and financial statements.

EBC&rsquo;s
annual report for 2014 was the first time EBC&rsquo;s management was required to provide a report on its internal controls and
procedures
 including the internal controls over financial reporting
 although management has conducted reviews of such internal
controls and procedures in connection with the preparation and filing of its prior quarterly reports. As EBC continues as a publicly
reporting company
 EBC management will be required to continue to review our internal control over financial reporting for the
purpose of providing the reports required by the SEC&rsquo;s rules. As the Company grows
 following the closing of the Asset Purchase
Transaction (assuming Bayhawk shareholder approval is obtained)
 and during the course of our ongoing reviews and testing
 we
may identify deficiencies or our controls and procedures may no longer be deemed to be effective. Furthermore
 if we have a material
weakness in our internal control over financial reporting
 we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements
may be materially misstated. We or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to conclude on an ongoing
basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting
 which could harm our operating results
 cause investors
to lose confidence in our reported financial information and cause the trading price of our stock to fall. In addition
 as a public
company we are required to file in a timely manner accurate quarterly and annual reports with the SEC under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;)
 as amended.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any failure to report our financial results on an accurate
and timely basis could result in sanctions
 lawsuits
 delisting of our shares from the market or trading facility where our shares
may trade
 or other adverse consequences that would materially harm our business.

Because
EBC has shown a net loss since inception
 ownership of EBC shares could result in a complete loss of the value of your investment
if EBC is unsuccessful in its business plans.

Based
upon current plans
 EBC expects to incur operating losses in future periods as it incurs significant expenses associated with
the growth of its business.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further
 there is no guarantee that it will be successful in realizing future revenues
or in achieving or sustaining positive cash flow at any time in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any such failure could result in the possible
closure of its business or force EBC to seek additional capital through loans or additional sales of its equity securities to
continue business operations
 which would dilute the value of any shares you purchase in this offering.



    
    


Growth
and development of operations will depend on the acceptance of EBC&rsquo;s proposed business.&nbsp;&nbsp;If EBC&rsquo;s products
are not deemed desirable and suitable for purchase and it cannot establish a customer base
 it may not be able to generate future
revenues
 which would result in a failure of the business and a loss of the value of your investment.

The
acceptance of EBC&rsquo;s brewing products for its customers is critically important to its success. EBC cannot be certain that
the services that it will be offering will be appealing and as a result there may not be any demand for these products and its
sales could be limited and it may never realize any revenues. In addition
 there are no assurances that if it alters or changes
the products it offers in the future that the demand for these new products will develop and this could adversely affect our business
and any possible revenues.

If
demand for the products EBC plans to offer slows
 then its business would be materially affected
 which could result in the loss
of your entire investment of EBC&rsquo;s common stock.

Demand
for products which we intend to sell depends on many factors
 including:



    
    
the
    number of customers EBC is able to attract and retain over time.

    
    
    

    
    
the
    economy
 and in periods of rapidly declining economic conditions
 customers may defer products such as ours in order to pay
    secured debts or debts that must be paid in order to remain solvent.

    
    
    

    
    
the
    competitive environment in the micro-brewery market may force it to reduce prices below its desired pricing level or increase
    promotional spending.

    
    
    

    
    
the
ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers&rsquo; needs in a timely cost effective manner.


For
the long term
 demand for the products we plan to offer may be affected by:



    
    
the
    ability to establish
 maintain and eventually grow market share in a competitive environment.

    
    
    

    
    
delivery
    of its information globally
 geopolitical changes
 changes in liquor regulations
 currency fluctuations
 natural disasters
    pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items it purchases
 create communication issues or
    render product delivery difficult which could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profitability.


All
of these factors could result in immediate and longer term declines in the demand for the products it plans to offer
 which could
adversely affect its sales
 cash flows and overall financial condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;

EBC
has limited management resources
 and will be dependent on key executives. The loss of the services of the current officers and
directors could severely impact EBC&rsquo;s business operations and future development
 which could result in a loss of revenues
and adversely impact the ability to ever sell any shares owned.

EBC
is relying on a small number of key individuals to implement its business and operations and
 in particular
 the professional
expertise and services of Michael J. Rapport
 our President
 Chief Executive Officer
 Secretary
 and Chairman of the Board of
Directors; Kenneth Wiedrich
 our Chief Financial Officer; and Evan Rapport
 our Vice President and a member of the Board of Directors.
Accordingly
 EBC may not have sufficient managerial resources to successfully manage the increased business activity envisioned
by its business strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition
 EBC's future success depends in large part on the continued service of Mr. Michael
Rapport and Mr. Evan Rapport.&nbsp;&nbsp;EBC has not entered into an employment agreement with Michael Rapport
 and has an employment
agreement with Evan Rapport that runs for three years. If either of these persons chooses not to serve as officers or if they
are unable to perform their duties
 this could have an adverse effect on Company business operations
 financial condition and
operating results if it is unable to replace them with other individuals qualified to develop and market its business.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
loss of their services could result in a loss of revenues
 which could result in a reduction of the value of any stock owned.



    
    


EBC&rsquo;s
industry requires attracting and retaining talented employees
 and the inability to retain such talented employees could result
in the loss of the value of your investment. 

Success
in the microbrew industry does and will continue to require the acquisition and retention of highly talented and experienced individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Due
to the growth in the market segment targeted
 such individuals and the talent and experience they possess is in high demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;There
is no guarantee that we will be able to attract and maintain access to such individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we fail to attract
 train
motivate and retain talented personnel
 our business
 financial condition
 and operating results may be materially and adversely
impacted
 which could result in the loss of your entire investment.

The
speculative nature of our business could result in unpredictable results and a loss of the value of your investment. 

The
microbrewery and beer brewing industry is extremely competitive and the commercial success of any product is often dependent on
factors beyond our control
 including but not limited to market acceptance and retailers' prominently shelving and selling our
products.&nbsp;&nbsp;We may experience substantial cost overruns in manufacturing and marketing our products
 and may not have
sufficient capital to successfully complete any of our projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;We may also incur uninsured losses for liabilities
which arise in the ordinary course of business in the manufacturing industry
 or which are unforeseen
 including but not limited
to trademark infringement
 product liability
 and employment liability.

Competition
that EBC faces is varied and strong.

EBC&rsquo;s
products and industry as a whole are subject to extreme competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no guarantee that we can sustain our
market position or expand our business.&nbsp;&nbsp;We anticipate that the intensity of competition in the future will increase.

We
compete with a number of entities in providing products to our customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such competitor entities include: (1) a variety
of large nationwide corporations
 including but not limited to public entities and companies that have established loyal customer
bases over several decades; (2) local breweries and microbreweries that have the same or a similar business plan as we do; and
(3) a variety of other local and national breweries and with which we either currently or may
 in the future
 compete.

Many
of our current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories
 significantly greater financial
and operational resources
 and name recognition than we have.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result
 these competitors may have greater credibility
with both existing and potential customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;They also may be able to offer more competitive products and services and
more aggressively promote and sell their products.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our competitors may also be able to support more aggressive pricing
than we will be able to
 which could adversely affect sales
 cause us to decrease our prices to remain competitive
 or otherwise
reduce the overall gross profit earned on our products.

Additionally
our third party providers themselves are subject to the intensely competitive market.&nbsp;&nbsp;We rely on such providers for
underlying services and products that enable and/or facilitate the creation of our products.&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition or grain shortages
may affect our suppliers&rsquo; ability to innovate and to continue existing product and service offerings
 which could result
in the loss of the value of your entire investment.

Our
success in business and operations will depend on general economic conditions.

The
success of EBC depends
 to a large extent
 on certain economic factors that are beyond its control.&nbsp;&nbsp;Factors such as
general economic conditions
 levels of unemployment
 interest rates
 tax rates at all levels of government
 competition and other
factors beyond EBC&rsquo;s control may have an adverse effect on EBC&rsquo;s ability to sell its products and to collect sums
due and owing to it.



    
    


Changes
in consumer preferences and discretionary spending may have a material adverse effect on our revenue
 results of operations and
financial condition.

Our
success depends
 in part
 upon the popularity of our products and our ability to organically develop new brands or acquire the
licensing or distribution rights to existing brands that appeal to consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shifts in consumer preferences away from
our products
 our inability to develop new products that appeal to consumers
 or changes in our product mix that eliminate items
popular with some consumers could harm our business.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also
 our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary
consumer spending
 which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly
we may experience declines in revenue during economic downturns or during periods of uncertainty.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any material decline
in the amount of discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on our sales
 results of operations
 business and
financial condition.

EBC
may not be able to successfully implement its business strategy
 which could adversely affect its business
 financial condition
results of operations and cash flows.&nbsp;&nbsp;If EBC cannot successfully implement its business strategy
 it could result in
the loss of the value of your investment. 

Successful
implementation of its business strategy depends on factors specific to the liquor industry and micro-breweries specifically
 and
the state of the financial industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond its control.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adverse changes in the
following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse effect on its business
 its financial condition
and results of operations and cash flow:



    
    
The
    competitive environment in the micro-brew industry that may force us to reduce prices below the optimal pricing level or increase
    promotional spending;

    
    
    

    
    
Its
    ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers&rsquo; needs for our products in a timely cost
    effective manner; and




    
    
Its
    ability to establish
 maintain and eventually grow market share in a competitive environment.


There
are no substantial barriers to entry into the industry
 and because EBC has only limited copyright protection for the products
it intends to sell
 there is no guarantee someone else will not duplicate its ideas and bring them to market before it does
 which
could severely limit EBC&rsquo;s sales and revenues.&nbsp;&nbsp;If EBC cannot generate sales and&nbsp;revenues
 it could result
in the loss of the value of your investment. 

Because
EBC has limited copyright and trademark protection
 unauthorized persons may attempt to copy aspects of EBC&rsquo;s business
including its product design or functionality
 services or marketing materials. Any encroachment upon EBC&rsquo;s corporate information
including the unauthorized use of its brand names
 the use of a similar name by a competing company
 or a lawsuit initiated against
EBC for infringement upon another company's proprietary information or improper use of their copyright
 may affect its ability
to create brand name recognition
 cause customer confusion and/or have a detrimental effect on its business.&nbsp;&nbsp;Litigation
or proceedings before the U.S. or International Patent and Trademark Offices may be necessary in the future to enforce EBC&rsquo;s
intellectual property rights
 to protect its trade secrets and domain name and/or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary
rights of others.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any such infringement
 litigation or adverse proceeding could result in substantial costs and diversion
of resources and could seriously harm its business operations and/or results of operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result
 an investment
in the Company could result in the loss of the entire investment.

Failure
of third-party distributors upon which we rely could adversely affect our business and result in the loss of your investment

Like
most craft brewers
 EBC plans to rely heavily on third party distributors for the sale of their products to retailers.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
loss of a significant distributor could have a material adverse effect on EBC&rsquo;s business
 financial condition and results
of operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;EBC&rsquo;s distributors often represent competing specialty beer brands
 as well as national beer brands
and are to varying degrees influenced by their continued business relationships with other brewers.&nbsp;&nbsp;EBC&rsquo;s independent
distributors may be influenced by a large brewer if they rely on that brewer for a significant portion of their sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;While
we believe that the relationships between EBC and its distributors are generally good
 many of these relationships are relatively
new and untested and there can be no assurance that EBC&rsquo;s distributors will continue to effectively market and distribute
EBC&rsquo;s beer.&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of any distributor or the inability to replace a poorly performing distributor in a timely
fashion could have a material adverse effect on the business
 financial condition and results of operations of EBC.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore
no assurance can be given that EBC will successfully attract new distributors as they increase their presence in their existing
markets or expand into new markets.



    
    


We
likely will have limited market for the acquired brands in a concentrated geographic area.

Bayhawk
Ales primarily has sold its products through different distributors across California
 as well as through Prestige Imports
 Mt
Clemens
 MI
 which represents the Bayhawk products nationally. &nbsp;&nbsp;There is no assurance that Bayhawk&rsquo;s brands will
be as widely accepted
 or that consumers in new geographic markets will be receptive to Bayhawks&rsquo;s products.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management
believes that California and Private Label Sales are likely to continue to be the largest market for its brands
 and that regional
identification may assist EBC&rsquo;s competitors in other regions. Penetration of other regional markets is an important element
of EBC&rsquo;s expansion plan
 and failure to accomplish this objective will hinder the success of the expansion plan and could
have a material adverse impact on EBC&rsquo;s business
 financial condition
 and results of operations.

EBC
depends on a limited number of suppliers; cost and availability of raw materials.

EBC
relies upon a limited number of suppliers for raw materials used to make and package EBC&rsquo;s products
 including
 but not
limited to
 providers of hops
 grains and other products necessary for us to manufacture our product.&nbsp;&nbsp;EBC&rsquo;s success
will depend in part upon our ability to successfully secure such materials from suppliers that are delivered with consistency
and at a quality that meets our requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;The price and availability of these materials are subject to market conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Increases
in the price of our products due to the increase in the cost of raw materials could have a negative effect on our business.

If
EBC is unable to obtain sufficient quantities or other raw materials
 delays or reductions in product shipments could occur which
would have a material adverse effect on the business
 financial condition and results of operations of EBC.&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs
of grains and hops are volatile and unpredictable.&nbsp;&nbsp;As with most agricultural products
 the supply and price of raw
materials used to produce EBC&rsquo;s beer can be affected by a number of factors beyond EBC&rsquo;s control
 such as frosts
droughts
 other weather conditions
 economic factors affecting growing decisions
 and various plant diseases and pests.&nbsp;&nbsp;If
any of the foregoing were to occur
 no assurance can be given that such condition would not have a material adverse effect on
the business
 financial condition and results of operations of EBC.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition
 the results of operations of EBC are
dependent upon its ability to accurately forecast its requirements of raw materials.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any failure by EBC to accurately
forecast its demand for raw materials could result in an inability to meet higher than anticipated demand for products or producing
excess inventory
 either of which may adversely affect results of operations of EBC.

While
EBC believes that the relations of Bayhawk and Evans Brewing California with their suppliers are good
 there can be no assurance
that these suppliers will be able or willing to supply EBC with materials at the current pricing levels
 or at all
 or that it
will be successful in engaging alternative suppliers on commercially reasonable terms which meet the quality or pricing levels
currently experienced by EBC.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result
 should EBC&rsquo;s costs increase and if those increases are unable to be
passed on to its customers
 our business
 financial condition
 and results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely
impacted
 which could result in the loss of your entire investment.

Product
Concentration; dependence on new product introductions.

EBC
is dependent on three principal brands: the Bayhawk Brands; the Evans Brands; and the Pigs Eye Brands
 to generate revenues.&nbsp;&nbsp;While
we anticipate expanding our product offerings
 we expect that these brands will continue to account for a large portion of our
revenues for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore
 EBC&rsquo;s future operating results
 particularly in the near term
are significantly dependent upon the continued market acceptance of these beer products.&nbsp;&nbsp;There can be no assurance
that EBC's beer products will continue to achieve market acceptance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial sales for a new alcoholic beverage product
may be caused by the interest of distributors and retailers to have the latest product on hand for potential future sale to consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;As
a result
 initial stocking orders for
 or sales of
 a newly introduced alcoholic beverage product may not be indicative of market
acceptance and long term consumer demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;A decline in the demand for any of EBC's beers as a result of competition
changes in consumer tastes and preferences
 government regulation or other factors would have a material adverse effect on EBC's
business
 operating results and financial condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition
 there can be no assurance that EBC will be successful
in importing
 developing
 managing
 introducing and marketing additional new alcoholic beverage products that will sustain sales
growth in the future.



    
    


Our
revenue growth rate depends primarily on our ability to satisfy relevant channels and end-customer demands
 identify suppliers
of our necessary ingredients and to coordinate those suppliers
 all subject to many unpredictable factors.

We
may not be able to identify and maintain the necessary relationships with suppliers of product and services as planned.&nbsp;&nbsp;Delays
or failures in deliveries could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy and expected results.&nbsp;&nbsp;As we supply
more customers
 our rate of expansion relative to the size of such customer base will decline. In addition
 one of our biggest
challenges is securing an adequate supply of suitable product.&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition for product is intense
 and commodities
costs subject to price volatility.

Our
ability to execute our business plan also depends on other factors
 including:



    
    
there
is no guarantee that we will enter into definitive agreements with distributors and on acceptable terms;




    
    
hiring
and training qualified personnel in local markets;

    
    
    

    
    
managing
marketing and development costs at affordable levels;




    
    
cost
and availability of labor;

    
    
    

    
    
the
availability of
 and our ability to obtain
 adequate supplies of ingredients that meet our quality standards; and




    
    
securing
    required governmental approvals in a timely manner when necessary.


We
lack sales
 marketing and distribution capabilities and depend on third parties to market our products.

We
have minimal personnel dedicated solely to sales and marketing of our products and therefore we must rely primarily upon third
party distributors to market and sell our products.&nbsp;&nbsp;These third parties may not be able to market our product successfully
or may not devote the time and resources to marketing our products that we require.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also rely upon third party carriers
to distribute and deliver our products.&nbsp;&nbsp;As such
 our deliveries are to a certain extent out of our control.&nbsp;&nbsp;If
we choose to develop our own sales
 marketing or distribution capabilities
 we will need to build a marketing and sales force
with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities
 which will require a substantial amount of management
and financial resources that may not be available.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we or a third party are not able to adequately sell and distribute
our product
 our business will be materially harmed.

The
manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages is regulated by federal and state law; taxation.

The
manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages is a business that is highly regulated and taxed at the federal
 state and local levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;EBC&rsquo;s
operations may be subject to more restrictive regulations and increased taxation by federal
 state and local governmental agencies
than are those of non-alcohol related businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance
 operation of EBC&rsquo;s breweries requires various
federal
 state and local licenses
 permits and approvals.&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss or revocation of any existing licenses
 permits
or approvals
 failure to obtain any additional or new licenses
 permits or approvals or the failure to obtain approval for the
transfer of any existing permits or licenses could have a material adverse effect on the ability of EBC to conduct its business.&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain
states have laws restricting or forbidding a combined pub and brewery.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore
 U.S. Treasury Department
 Bureau
of Alcohol
 Tobacco and Firearms (&quot;BATF&quot;) regulations prohibit
 among other things
 the payment of beer slotting allowances
to retailers. These regulations have the effect of preventing competitors with greater financial resources from excluding smaller
brewers from retailers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any repeal or substantial modification of these regulations or the enactment of any new legislation
or regulations could have a material adverse effect on the business
 financial condition and results of operations of EBC.



    
    


The
distribution of alcohol-based beverages is also subject to extensive federal and state taxation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our operations may
be subject to increased taxation as compared with those of non-alcohol related businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;In such event
 we have to
raise prices on our products in order to maintain profit margins.&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of such an increase could negatively impact
our sales or profitability.

We
face various operating hazards
 which if not addressed correctly
 could result in the reduction of our operations and the loss
of your investment.

EBC&rsquo;s
operations are subject to certain hazards and liability risks faced by all brewers
 such as potential contamination of ingredients
or products by bacteria or other external agents that may be wrongfully or accidentally introduced into products or packaging.&nbsp;&nbsp;EBC&rsquo;s
products are not pasteurized.&nbsp;&nbsp;While EBC has never experienced a contamination problem in their products
 the occurrence
of such a problem could result in a costly product recall and serious damage to the reputation of EBC for product quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;EBC&rsquo;s
operations also subject employees and others to certain injury and liability risks normally associated with the operation and
possible malfunction of brewing and other equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although EBC maintains insurance against certain risks under various
general liability and product liability insurance policies
 no assurance can be given that EBC&rsquo;s insurance will be adequate
to fully cover any incidents of product contamination or injuries resulting from brewery operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot assure
you that we will be able to continue to maintain insurance with adequate coverage for liabilities or risks arising from our business
operations on acceptable terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the insurance is adequate
 insurance premiums could increase significantly
which could result in higher costs to us.

Litigation
and publicity concerning product quality
 health and other issues
 which can result in liabilities and also cause customers to
avoid our products
 could adversely affect our results of operations
 business and financial condition.

Beverage
and food service businesses can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from customers or government authorities resulting
from food and beverage quality
 illness
 injury or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from consumption of products.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adverse
publicity about these allegations may negatively affect us
 regardless of whether the allegations are true
 by discouraging customers
from buying our products. We could also incur significant liabilities
 if a lawsuit or claim results in a decision against us
or litigation costs
 regardless of the result.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further
 any litigation may cause our key employees to expend resources
and time normally devoted to the operations of our business.

The
alcohol-based beverage industry also faces the possibility of class action or other similar litigation alleging that the continued
excessive use or abuse of alcohol-based beverages has caused death or serious health problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also possible
that federal or state governments could assert that the use of alcohol-based beverages has significantly increased that portion
of health care costs paid for by the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;Litigation or assertions of this type have adversely affected companies
in the tobacco industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible
 however
 that our suppliers could be named in litigation of this type which
could have a negative impact on their business and
 in turn
 could also have a significant negative impact on our business.

Risks
Related to Our Common Stock and the Share Exchange

Investors
who choose to purchase shares of EBC common stock if and when offered
 may have difficulty in reselling their shares due to the
lack of market or state Blue Sky laws.

As
of the date of this Report
 our common stock had been accepted for trading on the OTC Markets Pink Sheets
 although there can
be no guarantee that any market will ever develop for our common stock
 or if developed
 may not be sustained in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors
should be aware that there might be additional significant state law restrictions upon the ability of investors to resell our
shares. Accordingly
 even if we are successful in having our shares available for trading on the OTC QB or QX markets
 investors
should consider any secondary market for our securities to be a limited one.



    
    


Sales
of our common stock under Rule 144 could reduce the price of our stock.

None
of our outstanding common shares are currently eligible for resale under Rule 144. In general
 persons holding restricted securities
in a publicly reporting company that is providing current public information meeting the requirements of Rule 144
 including affiliates
must hold their shares for a period of at least six months.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because EBC was previously a &ldquo;shell company&rdquo;
as defined in the rules of the SEC
 Rule 144 is unavailable until one year from the date on which EBC filed &ldquo;Form 10 information&rdquo;
with the SEC (namely
 December 15
 2015)
 which was contained in this Proxy Statement/Registration Statement and was incorporated
by reference into the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 15
 2015. Additionally
 affiliates of EBC may not sell more
than one percent of the total issued and outstanding shares in any 90-day period and must resell the shares in an unsolicited
brokerage transaction at the market price. If substantial amounts of our common stock become available for resale under Rule 144
once a market has developed for our common stock
 the then-prevailing market prices for our common stock may be reduced.

We
may
 in the future
 issue additional securities
 which would reduce our stockholders&rsquo; percent of ownership and may dilute
our share value.

Our
Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue 100
000
000 shares of common stock. As of the date of this annual report
we had 4
469
863 shares of common stock outstanding. Accordingly
 we may issue up to an additional 95
530
137 shares of common
stock. The future issuance of common stock may result in additional dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our
then existing stockholders. We may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis including for services or
acquisitions or other corporate actions that may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our stockholders
and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally
 our board of directors may
designate the rights terms and preferences of one or more series of preferred stock at its discretion including conversion and
voting preferences without prior notice to our stockholders.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any of these events could have a dilutive effect on the
ownership of our shareholders
 and the value of shares owned.

Raising
additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders.

We
may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings
 debt financings
 collaborations
 and
strategic and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock or securities
convertible or exchangeable into common stock
 your ownership interest in EBC will be diluted.

Raising
additional capital may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights.

We
may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings
 debt financings
 collaborations
 and
strategic and licensing arrangements.&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock
or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock
 the terms of any such securities may include liquidation or other
preferences that materially adversely affect your rights as a stockholder.&nbsp;&nbsp;Debt financing
 if available
 would increase
our fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific
actions
 such as incurring additional debt
 making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we raise additional
funds through collaboration
 strategic partnerships and licensing arrangements with third parties
 we may have to relinquish valuable
rights to our intellectual property
 future revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.

Market
volatility may affect our stock price and the value of your shares.

Once
a market for our common stock is established
 the market price for our common stock is likely to be volatile
 in part because
our common stock has not been previously traded publicly. In addition
 the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly
in response to a number of factors
 most of which we cannot control
 including
 among others:



    
    
announcements
    of new products
 brands
 commercial relationships
 acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;&nbsp;




    
    




    
    
regulatory
    or legal developments in the United States and other countries;&nbsp;

    
    
    

    
    
fluctuations
    in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies;&nbsp;

    
    
    

    
    
general
    market conditions and overall fluctuations in U.S. equity markets;&nbsp;

    
    
    

    
    
variations
    in our quarterly operating results;&nbsp;

    
    
    

    
    
changes
    in our financial guidance or securities analysts' estimates of our financial performance;&nbsp;

    
    
    

    
    
changes
    in accounting principles;&nbsp;

    
    
    

    
    
our
    ability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we can raise it;&nbsp;

    
    
    

    
    
sales
    of large blocks of our common stock
 including sales by our executive officers
 directors and significant stockholders;&nbsp;

    
    
    

    
    
additions
    or departures of key personnel;&nbsp;

    
    
    

    
    
discussion
    of us or our stock price by the press and by online investor communities; and&nbsp;

    
    
    

    
    
other
    risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors.


An
active public market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained. We will work to negotiate and determine the initial
public sale price with our market makers
 but this price may not be indicative of prices that will prevail in the trading market.&nbsp;&nbsp;

If
securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports or publish misleading
 inaccurate or unfavorable
research about us
 our business or our market
 our stock price and trading volume could decline.

The
trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts may publish
about us
 our business
 our market or our competitors. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities
and industry analysts. If no or few securities or industry analysts cover our company
 the trading price and volume of our stock
would likely be negatively impacted. If we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage and if one or more of the analysts who
covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business
 or provides more favorable
relative recommendations about our competitors
 our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases
coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly
 demand for our stock could decrease
 which could cause our stock price
or trading volume to decline.

Future
sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline.

Sales
of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could
significantly reduce the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise adequate capital through the sale of
additional equity securities.

We
will be subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions
 and you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock.

The
SEC has adopted regulations which generally define so-called &ldquo;penny stocks&rdquo; to be an equity security that has a market
price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share
 subject to certain exemptions. We anticipate
that our common stock will become a &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo;
 and we will become subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act
or the &ldquo;Penny Stock Rule&rdquo;. This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such
securities to persons other than established customers. For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9
 a broker-dealer must make a special
suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser&rsquo;s written consent to the transaction prior to
sale. As a result
 this rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers
to sell any of our securities in the secondary market.



    
    


For
any transaction involving a penny stock
 unless exempt
 the rules require delivery
 prior to any transaction in a penny stock
of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about
sales commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities.
Finally
 monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account
and information on the limited market in penny stock.

We
do not anticipate that our common stock will qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event
 even if our common
stock were exempt from the Penny Stock Rule
 we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act
 which gives the
SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock
 if the SEC finds that such a restriction
would be in the public interest.

Our
compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC rules concerning internal controls may be time consuming
 difficult and costly.

EBC&rsquo;s
executive officers do not have experience being an officer of a public company.&nbsp;&nbsp; It may be time consuming
 difficult
and costly for us to develop and implement the internal controls and reporting procedures required by Sarbanes-Oxley.&nbsp;&nbsp;We
may need to hire additional financial reporting
 internal controls and other finance staff in order to develop and implement appropriate
internal controls and reporting procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are unable to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley&rsquo;s internal controls
requirements
 we may not be able to obtain the independent accountant certifications that Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires publicly-traded
companies to obtain.

Due
to the lack of a trading market for our securities
 you may have difficulty selling any shares you purchase in this offering
which could result in the loss of your investment.

There
is presently no demand for our common stock and only a limited public market exists for the shares..&nbsp;&nbsp;We have worked
with a market maker and our shares have been accepted for trading on the OTC Markets Pink Sheets. However
 there is no guarantee
that a trading market will ever develop.&nbsp;&nbsp;The OTC Markets are regulated quotation services that display real-time quotes
last sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter (OTC) securities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The services are not an issuer listing
service
 market or exchange. To be eligible for quotation on the OTC Markets OTCQB or OTCQX markets
 issuers must remain current
in their filings with the SEC or applicable regulatory authority. Market Makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security
whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement. If no market is ever developed for our common stock
 it will be difficult
or impossible for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering.&nbsp;&nbsp;In such case
 you may find that you are unable
to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay
 if at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition
if EBC fails to have its common stock quoted on a public trading market
 your common stock will not have a quantifiable value
and it may be difficult
 if not impossible
 to ever resell your shares
 resulting in an inability to realize any value from your
investment.

EBC
may issue Preferred Stock with voting and conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of Common
Stock.

Although
EBC presently has no intention to do so without stockholder approval
 which may be obtained solely through the votes of its management
and board of directors
 the Board may issue Preferred Stock with voting and conversion rights that could adversely affect the
voting power of the holders of Common Stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any such provision may be deemed to have a potential anti-takeover effect
and the issuance of Preferred Stock in accordance with such provision may delay or prevent a change of control of EBC.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Board of Directors also may declare a dividend on any outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;



    
    


We
may never pay dividends to shareholders
 which could reduce the monetary gain you may realize on your investment

We
have not declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock.&nbsp; We currently intend to retain our future
earnings
 if any
 to support operations and to finance expansion and therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends
on our common stock in the foreseeable future.

The
declaration
 payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors
 and will depend
upon
 among other things
 the results of our operations
 cash flows and financial condition
 operating and capital requirements
and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant.&nbsp; There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid
and
 if dividends are paid
 there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend.&nbsp; If EBC does not pay dividends
EBC&rsquo;s common stock may be less valuable because a return on an investor&rsquo;s investment will only occur if EBC&rsquo;s
stock price appreciates.

Evans
Brewing Company Inc. (&ldquo;EBC&rdquo;)
 was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 18
 2013
 as ALPINE
3 Inc. On July 3
 2013
 EBC filed a Registration Statement on Form 10 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;SEC&rdquo;)
to become a public company.

EBC
was formed by Richard Chiang
 who was the initial stockholder and the initial sole officer and director. On April 19
 2014
 the
Board of Director appointed Mr. Michael J. Rapport and Mr. Evan Rapport to the Board of Directors.

On
April 4
 2014
 Mr. Chiang entered into a Share Purchase Agreement pursuant to which he sold an aggregate of 10
000
000 shares
of EBC&rsquo;s common stock to The Michael J. Rapport Trust (the &ldquo;Trust&rdquo;) for a purchase price of $40
000. Pursuant
to the Share Purchase Agreement
 the Trust became the sole shareholder of EBC
 owning 100% of the issued and outstanding shares
of EBC&rsquo;s common stock.

Overview
and Highlights

Company
Background

Evans
Brewing Company Inc. (&ldquo;EBC&rdquo;)
 was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 18
 2013
 as ALPINE
3
Inc. On July 3
 2013
 EBC filed a Registration Statement on Form 10 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;SEC&rdquo;)
to become a public company.

EBC
was formed by Richard Chiang
 who was the initial stockholder and the initial sole officer and director. On April 19
 2014
 the
Board of Director appointed Mr. Michael J. Rapport and Mr. Evan Rapport to the Board of Directors.

On
April 4 2014
 Mr. Chiang entered into a Share Purchase Agreement pursuant to which he sold an aggregate of 10
000
000 shares of
EBC&rsquo;s common stock to The Michael J. Rapport Trust (the &ldquo;Trust&rdquo;) for a purchase price of $40
000. Pursuant to
the Share Purchase Agreement
 the Trust became the sole shareholder of EBC
 owning 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of
EBC&rsquo;s common stock.



    
    


Immediately
following the closing of the Share Purchase Agreement transaction
 Mr. Chiang tendered his resignation as EBC&rsquo;s President
Chief Executive Officer
 Chief Financial Officer
 Secretary and Chairman of the Board of Directors. Michael J. Rapport
 acting
as a member of the Registrant&rsquo;s Board of Directors
 accepted Mr. Chiang&rsquo;s resignation. The resignations were in connection
with the consummation of the Share Purchase Agreement with the Trust
 and were not the result of any disagreement with EBC on
any matter relating to EBC&rsquo;s operations
 policies
 or practices. Following Mr. Chiang&rsquo;s resignations
 Michael Rapport
appointed himself as President
 Chief Executive Officer
 Chief Financial Officer
 Secretary and Chairman of the Board of Directors
of EBC. Michael Rapport also appointed Evan Rapport as to serve as EBC's Vice President. Biographical Information for Michael
J. Rapport and for Evan Rapport is included below. Michael Rapport is the father of Evan Rapport.

Pursuant
to negotiations between EBC&rsquo;s management and the management of Bayhawk Ales Inc. (&ldquo;Bayhawk&rdquo;)
 EBC and Bayhawk
determined to enter into an Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement (the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;)
 subject to the approval
by the stockholders of Bayhawk
 as discussed herein. Pursuant to the Agreement
 EBC acquired the assets and operations of Bayhawk
including the assets and operations Evans Brewing Company
 a California corporation (&ldquo;Evans Brewing California&rdquo;)
but not including the owners of the outstanding shares of Evans Brewing California common stock
 which Bayhawk retained.. Bayhawk
and EBC are under common control by our majority shareholder at the time of the share exchange and as a result the transaction
will be accounted for as a business combination under common control
 a method similar to the pooling-of-interest method (&quot;Pooling-of-Interest&quot;).
EBC will be the operating entity going forward. The financial statements reflect the combined operations and combined history
of both companies.

Results
of Operations for the twelve months ended December 31
 2015 and December 31
 2014.

Our
operating results are summarized as follows:

During
the year ended December 31
 2015
 the sales of Evans Brewing Company
 Inc. were $1
952
301 compared $2
033
072 for the same period
ending December 31
 2014. The decrease in sales for the current period compared to the prior period is due to a fire in the brewery
that occurred in September of 2014. The brewery was shut down for three months and as a result lost many of its customers. It
has taken almost all of 2015 to get back these customers.

Operating
Expenses

Operating
expenses for the year ended December 31
 2015
 were $849
827 compared to $777
022 for the year ended December 31
 2014. The increase
in operating expenses are largely attributable to legal
 accounting and audit fees related to our S-4 registration statement to
complete the asset purchase agreement with Bayhawk. There was an increase in professional services of approximately $209
000 offset
by a decrease in general and administrative expense of approximately $150
000.

Interest
Expense:

Interest
expense for the year ended December 31
 2015
 was $12
197
 compared to $1
928
 for the year ended December 31
 2014. This interest
is mainly due to the related party note carried by EBC.



    
    


Other
Income:

Other
income for the year ended December 31
 2015
 was $22
411 compared to $333
834 for the year ended December 31
 2014. Both amounts
are associated with the claim receivable established by EBC in 2014 for the fire that damaged the brewery. EBC set up a claim
receivable for $300
000 and treated the gain as other income. EBC was paid $322
410 by the insurance company in 2015
 with $300
000
offsetting the receivable and the balance treated as other income.

Net
Loss:

Net
loss from operations for the year ended December 31
 2015
 was $353
923
 compared to a gain of $120
648 for the year ended December
31
 2014. The net loss for the fiscal year ended December 31
 2015
 was made up of a loss from operations of $354
138
 less other
income of $14
210
 plus a loss from taxes paid of $13
995. The gain of $120
648 for the year ended December 31
 2014
 was made
up of a net loss from operations of $184
488
 plus a gain from other income of $333
834
 less taxes paid of $25
395.&nbsp;

and a decrease in inventory offset by the claim receivable of $300
000 and an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expense.


Cash

377 used for the purchase of fixed assets offset by the
disposal of property of $28
000 and the acquisition of Evans Brewing California.



    
    


Cash
from Financing Activities

For
the year December 31
 2015
 cash provided by financing activities consisted of $274
042 received from issuance of notes offset
by payments on leased equipment of $26
670. For the year ended December 31
 2014
 cash used in financing activities consisted
of $117
500 received from issuance of notes offset by lease equipment payment of $160
020 and payment on notes payable of $71
471.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

There
are no off-balance sheet arrangements between EBC and any other entity that have
 or are reasonably likely to have
 a current
or future effect on the financial condition
 changes in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.

Impact
of Inflation

The
business will have to absorb any inflationary increases on development costs in the short-term
 with the expectation that it will
be able to pass inflationary increases on costs on to customers through price increases on the release of new/enhanced products
into the market and hence management does not expect inflation to be a significant factor in our business.

Critical
Accounting Policies

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements
 which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets
 liabilities
 revenues and expenses
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis
 we evaluate our estimates based on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Management
believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide useful and reliable financial information
about our operating results and financial condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the critical accounting estimates are detailed below.

Critical
Accounting Estimates and New Accounting Pronouncements

Critical
Accounting Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (&ldquo;U.S GAAP&rdquo;)
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management
considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:



    
    
it
    requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made
 and

    
    
    

    
    
changes
    in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our results of operations
    or financial condition.


EBC
bases its estimates and judgments on our experience
 our current knowledge
 and our beliefs of what could occur in the future
our observation of trends in the industry
 information provided by our customers and information available from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have identified the following
accounting policies and estimates as those that we believe are most critical to our financial condition and results of operations
and that require management&rsquo;s most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties:
share-based compensation expense
 income taxes
 and derivative financial instruments.&nbsp;



    
    


Share-Based
EBC plans to calculate share-based compensation expense for option awards and warrant
issuances (&quot;Share-based Awards&quot;) based on the estimated grant/issue-date fair value using the Black-Scholes-Merton option
pricing model (&quot;Black-Sholes Model&quot;)
 and recognize the expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period
 net
of estimated forfeitures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black-Scholes Model requires the use of a number of assumptions including volatility
of the stock price
 the weighted average risk-free interest rate
 and the vesting period of the Share-based Award in determining
the fair value of Share-based Awards.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we believe our assumptions used to calculate share-based compensation
expense are reasonable
 these assumptions can involve complex judgments about future events
 which are open to interpretation
and inherent uncertainty.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition
 significant changes to our assumptions could significantly impact the amount
of expense recorded in a given period.

Income
 As part of the process of preparing our financial statements
 EBC will be required to estimate income taxes in
each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach
to account for income taxes. A current liability is recorded for the estimated taxes payable for the current year. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the timing differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates or tax laws are recognized in the provision
for income taxes in the period that includes the enactment date.&nbsp;&nbsp;Valuation allowances are established
 when necessary
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more-likely-than-not to be realized.&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in valuation allowances will
flow through the statement of operations unless related to deferred tax assets that expire unutilized or are modified through
translation
 in which case both the deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance are similarly adjusted. Where a valuation
allowance was established through purchase accounting for acquired deferred tax assets
 any future change will be credited or
charged to income tax expense.

The
determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment
 the use of estimates
 and the interpretation and
application of complex tax laws.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ordinary course of our business
 there are transactions and calculations for
which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of our belief that we have appropriate support for all
the positions taken on our tax returns
 we acknowledge that certain positions may be successfully challenged by the taxing authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;We
determine the tax benefits more likely than not to be recognized with respect to uncertain tax positions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
we believe our recorded tax assets and liabilities are reasonable
 tax laws and regulations are subject to interpretation and
inherent uncertainty; therefore
 our assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely on
estimates and assumptions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable
 the final determination
could be materially different than that which is reflected in our provision for income taxes and recorded tax assets and liabilities.

New
Accounting Pronouncements


The
FASB issued ASU 2015-11 in July
 2015
 to provide guidance on how an entity should measure inventory within the scope of this Update
at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business
less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal
The
amendments in this Update more closely align the measurement of inventory in GAAP with the measurement of inventory in International
For public
business entities
 the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim
periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities
 the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15
 2016
 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017. The amendments in this Update
should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.


27
 2014
 providing guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the financial statements. The
new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going
concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if &ldquo;conditions
or events raise substantial doubt about [the] entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern.&rdquo; The ASU applies to
all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15
 2016
 and interim periods thereafter
 with early adoption
permitted.

Management
does not believe there would be a material effect on the accompanying financial statements had any other recently issued but not
yet effective accounting standards been adopted in the current period.

Closing
of Asset Purchase Transaction

On
December 10
 2015
 EBC completed the previously announced acquisition of the assets and liabilities of Bayhawk
 pursuant to an
Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement between EBC and Bayhawk
 dated October 15
 2014 (subsequently amended and restated
on August 6
 2015 (as amended
 the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;)).

Pursuant
to the Agreement
 Bayhawk had agreed to sell
 and EBC had agreed to purchase
 substantially all of Bayhawk&rsquo;s assets
 as
well as its liabilities (collectively
 the &ldquo;Asset Purchase Transaction&rdquo;). The assets and liabilities of Bayhawk include
personal property
 intellectual property
 inventory
 selected distribution contracts
 websites
 documents
 and all other assets
however delineated relating to the Bayhawk Ales labels; and (B) all assets
 including personal property
 intellectual property
inventory
 contracts
 websites
 documents
 and all other assets however delineated relating to the Evans Brands (collectively
the &ldquo;Transferred Assets&rdquo;)
 and the assumption by EBC
 pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement
of all of the liabilities of Bayhawk (the &ldquo;Assumed Liabilities&rdquo;). (The &ldquo;Evans Brands&rdquo; include the former
assets of Pig&rsquo;s Eye Brewing Company
 including its original beers
 lagers and ales (&ldquo;Pig&rsquo;s Eye Brands&rdquo;)
as well as Evans Lager Original
 Evans Lager Black
 Evans Lager Light
 Bad Kat Ice
 and Dead Presidents.) Pursuant to the Agreement
EBC has the right to purchase from Bayhawk 100% ownership in Evans Brewing Company
 Inc.
 a California corporation (&ldquo;Evans
Brewing California&rdquo;). 



    
    


Pursuant
to the Agreement
 EBC and Bayhawk agreed to seek approval of the shareholders of Bayhawk relating to the Asset Purchase Transaction.
Because the principal majority stockholders of Bayhawk are also significant stockholders of EBC
 Bayhawk and EBC agreed to proceed
with the Asset Purchase Transaction if it was approved by the holders of at least a majority of the Independent Shares (i.e. shares
not held by Bayhawk&rsquo;s majority shareholder
 The Michael J. Rapport Trust
 or by Evan Rapport
 who is an officer of EBC and
the son of Michael Rapport) that actually vote on the Asset Purchase Transaction proposal.

As
noted above
 EBC and Bayhawk filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
&ldquo;Registration Statement&rdquo;)
 which went effective on August 10
 2015. The Registration Statement included a proxy statement
seeking the votes of the Bayhawk shareholders on the Asset Purchase Transaction by written consent. On September 17
 2015
 the
voting period closed
 and EBC announced that approximately 99% of the shares that were voted had voted in favor of the Asset Purchase
Transaction.

In
connection with the Asset Purchase Transaction
 EBC and Bayhawk entered into a General Assignment and Bill of Sale agreement (the
&ldquo;Bill of Sale&rdquo;) which outlined the specific assets purchased
 as well as an Assignment and Assumption of Liabilities
agreement (the &ldquo;Assumption Agreement) which outlined the specific liabilities of Bayhawk assumed by EBC.

Equipment
Lease to Bayhawk

Following
the closing of the Asset Purchase Transaction
 EBC entered into an equipment lease (the &ldquo;Equipment Lease&rdquo;) with Bayhawk
pursuant to which EBC leased the brewing equipment to Bayhawk. The Equipment Lease was effective as of December 1
 2015
 and continues
month to month. Bayhawk agreed to pay a minimum of $15
000 per month or net profits from operations
 whichever is greater. The
title to the leased equipment will remain with EBC
 and EBC has the right to inspect the equipment and its usage.

The
foregoing summaries of the terms and conditions of the Bill of Sale
 the Assumption Agreement
 and the Equipment Lease (collectively
the &ldquo;Ancillary Agreements&rdquo;) do not purport to be complete
 and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
full text of the specific Ancillary Agreement
 each of which was attached as an exhibit to the Company&rsquo;s Current Report
on Form 8-K
 filed with the SEC on December 15
 2015.

Change
in Shell Company Status

In
connection with the closing of the Asset Purchase Transaction and the entry into the Bill of Sale and the Assumption Agreement
EBC acquired the assets (other than the ownership of Evans Brewing California)
 the liabilities
 and the operations of Bayhawk.
As such
 on December 10
 2015
 in connection with this acquisition
 EBC ceased to be a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2
in that it has assets consisting of more than cash and cash equivalents
 and has a business plan and operations.

Share
Exchange

As
discussed in more detail in the Registration Statement
 as partial consideration for the purchase of the Transferred Assets and
the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities
 EBC agreed to offer to exchange shares of EBC common stock for all shares of Bayhawk
common stock that were tendered in connection with such offer
 the transaction being referred to as the &ldquo;Share Exchange.&rdquo;
The ratio of the share exchange is one (1) share of EBC common stock for each one (1) share of Bayhawk common stock.



    
    


Pursuant
to the terms of the Agreement
 the Share Exchange offer was open for a period (the &ldquo;Exchange Period&rdquo;) of seventy-five
(75) calendar days following the closing of the voting for the Asset Purchase Transaction. Bayhawk stockholders could tender shares
of Bayhawk common stock for participation in the Share Exchange during the Exchange Period. Any Bayhawk stockholder who tendered
Bayhawk shares in the Share Exchange had the right to withdraw any such shares tendered at any time until the closing of the Exchange
Period. EBC agreed to use its best efforts to issue the EBC Exchange Shares within three (3) Business Days following the Close
of the Exchange Period. EBC and Bayhawk agreed that upon the expiration of the Exchange Period
 the Share Exchange offer would
be terminated
 and any Bayhawk shareholders who have not tendered their shares of Bayhawk&rsquo;s common stock may not be entitled
to participate in the Share Exchange. Additionally
 any Bayhawk stockholders who elected to not participate in the Share Exchange
would remain stockholders of Bayhawk.

On

 Inc.
 4
033
863 Bayhawk Ales
 Inc. shares
and issued 4

863 shares of Evans Brewing Company
 Inc. shares of common stock upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement by and between EBC and Bayhawk
 dated October 15
 2014
 as amended
(the &ldquo;Asset Purchase Agreement&rdquo;). EBC filed a copy of the Asset Purchase Agreement as an annex to a combination registration
statement and proxy statement on Form S-4. The Bayhawk shares were validly tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer and not withdrawn.

No
Change of Control

In
connection with the Asset Purchase Transaction
 there was no change in control of EBC. The officers and directors of EBC did not
change
 and the majority ownership of EBC did not change.

Michael
J. Rapport owned
 through The Michael J. Rapport Trust
 a majority of the outstanding common stock of both EBC and Bayhawk. As
such
 following the closing of the Share Exchange
 Mr. Rapport continued to own a majority of the common stock of EBC
 and as
such
 there was no change in control of EBC.

2015
Plan and S-8 Registration Statement

EBC
prepared and filed a Registration Statement in accordance with the requirements of Form S-8 under the Securities Act of 1933
as amended (the &ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;)
 to register the issuance of up to 2
000
000 shares of its common stock
 par value
$0.0001 per share
 that are reserved for issuance with respect to awards to be granted under the Company&rsquo;s 2015 Stock Option
and Stock Award Plan (the &ldquo;2015 Plan&rdquo;). EBC&rsquo;s Board of Directors and Stockholders approved the adoption of the
2015 Plan in October 2015. As of the date of this Annual Report
 no shares had been issued pursuant to the 2015 Plan or the Registration
Statement.

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements

In
the ordinary course of business
 we enter into agreements with third parties that include indemnification provisions which
 in
our judgment
 are normal and customary for companies in our industry sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;These agreements are typically with business
partners
 and suppliers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to these agreements
 we generally agree to indemnify
 hold harmless
 and reimburse
indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified parties with respect to our product candidates
 use of
such product candidates
 or other actions taken or omitted by us. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be
required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not incurred material costs to defend
lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result
 the estimated fair value of liabilities
relating to these provisions is minimal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly
 we have no liabilities recorded for these provisions as of December
31
 2015 or December 31
 2014.

In
the normal course of business
 we may be confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;These
generally relate to lawsuits
 claims
 environmental actions or the actions of various regulatory agencies. We consult with counsel
and other appropriate experts to assess the claim.&nbsp;&nbsp;If
 in our opinion
 we have incurred a probable loss as set forth
by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
 an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries
are reflected in our financial statements.

ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

January
2015 Dismissal of Kenne Ruan
 CPA
 P.C.; Engagement of Anton &amp; Chia
 LLP

On
January 21
 2015
 EBC&rsquo;s board of directors dismissed Kenne Ruan
 CPA
 P.C. (&ldquo;KR&rdquo;) as EBC&rsquo;s independent
registered public accounting firm effective immediately.

Other
than an explanatory paragraph included in audit report of KR for the Company's fiscal year ended December 31
 2013
 relating to
the uncertainty of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern
 the audit report of KR on the Company's financial statements
for the fiscal year ended December 31
 2013
 and through January 21
 2015
 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer
of opinion
 nor was it qualified or modified as to uncertainty
 audit scope or accounting principles.

During
the Company's 2013 and 2014 fiscal year and through the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K
 (1) there were no disagreements
with KR on any matter of accounting principles or practices
 financial statement disclosure
 or auditing scope or procedure
 which
if not resolved to the satisfaction of KR
 would have caused KR to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in
connection with their report
 and (2) there were no &ldquo;reportable events&rdquo; as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v)
of Regulation S-K.

Also
on January 21
 2015
 upon approval of EBC&rsquo;s Board of Directors
 EBC engaged Anton &amp; Chia
 LLP (&ldquo;A&amp;C&rdquo;)
as EBC&rsquo;s independent registered public accounting firm to audit EBC&rsquo;s financial statements and to perform reviews
of interim financial statements. During the fiscal year ended December 31
 2013
 through January 21
 2015
 neither EBC nor anyone
acting on its behalf consulted with A&amp;C regarding (i) either the application of any accounting principles to a specific completed
or contemplated transaction of the Company
 or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered by A&amp;C on the Company's financial
statements; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement with KR or a reportable event with respect to KR;
(iii) the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company&rsquo;s financial statements
 and none of the following
was provided to the Company: (a) a written report
 or (b) oral advice that A&amp;C concluded was an important factor considered
by the Company in reaching a decision as to accounting
 auditing or financial reporting issue; or (iv) Any matter that was the
subject of a disagreement
 as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K.

September
2015 Resignation of Anton &amp; Chia; Engagement of Kenne Ruan
 CPA
 P.C.

On
September 4
 2015
 EBC&rsquo;s Board of Directors accepted the resignation of A&amp;C
 dated the same date
 from their engagement
to be EBC&rsquo;s independent certifying accountant. Other than an explanatory paragraph included in A&amp;C&rsquo;s audit report
for EBC&rsquo;s fiscal year ended December 31
 2014
 relating to the uncertainty of BC&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going
concern
 the audit report for fiscal year ended December 31
 2014
 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion
nor was it qualified or modified as to uncertainty
 audit scope or accounting principles. As described below
 the change in independent
public accounting firms is not the result of any disagreement with A&amp;C. The Board of Directors approved the acceptance of
A&amp;C&rsquo;s resignation.

As
noted above
 A&amp;C was appointed by the Board of Directors to be the auditor on January 21
 2015. There were no disagreements
with A&amp;C on any matter of accounting principles or practices
 financial statement disclosure
 or auditing scope or procedure
which
 if not resolved to the satisfaction of A&amp;C
 would have caused A&amp;C to make reference to the subject matter of the
disagreements in connection with their report
 and (2) there were no &ldquo;reportable events&rdquo; as that term is defined in
Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.



    
    


On
September 4
 2015
 EBC&rsquo;s Board of Directors approved the engagement of Kenne Ruan
 CPA
 PC (&ldquo;KR&rdquo;)
 as EBC&rsquo;s
independent registered public accounting firm.

By
way of background
 KR was the independent certifying accountant for EBC from its inception in June 2013
 and provided an audit
report dated July 3
 2013
 with respect to EBC&rsquo;s financial statements as of June 30
 2013; and an audit report dated February
7
 2014
 for EBC&rsquo;s financial statements as of December 31
 2013. Additionally
 KR reviewed EBC&rsquo;s financial statements
provided in EBC&rsquo;s quarterly reports for the quarters ended March 31
 June 30
 and September 30
 2014 (collectively
 the
&ldquo;Prior Services&rdquo;). EBC previously dismissed KR on January 21
 2015
 in connection with the appointment of A&amp;C
noted above.

Other
than with respect to the Prior Services outlined above
 EBC has not consulted with KR during its two most recent fiscal years
or during any subsequent interim period prior to its re-appointment as EBC&rsquo;s auditor with respect to the application of
accounting principles to a specified transaction
 either completed or proposed
 or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered
on EBC&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements
 or any other matters or reportable events as defined in Items 304(a)(2)(i) and
(ii) of Regulation S-K.

ITEM
9A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer
 we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated
under the Exchange Act
 as of December 31
 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on this evaluation
 our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Report
 our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that&nbsp;information required to be included in our reports filed
or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized
 and reported as specified in the SEC&rsquo;s rules and
forms.

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During
the most recent fiscal year
 there has not occurred any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially
affected
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting. Our process for evaluating
controls and procedures is continuous and encompasses constant improvement of the design and effectiveness of established controls
and procedures and the remediation of any deficiencies which may be identified during this process.

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management&rsquo;s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that:



    
    
pertain
    to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
    our assets;

    
    
    

    
    
provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles;




    
    




    
    
provide
    reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management
    and directors; and

    
    
    

    
    
provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of assets that
    could have a material effect on our financial statements.


Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer
 we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on&nbsp;&nbsp;the
framework in &quot;Internal Control&mdash;Integrated Framework&quot; (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission.

Based
on this evaluation
 our management determined that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December
31
 2015
 and designed to provide reasonable assurance that&nbsp;information required to be included in our reports filed or submitted
under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized
 and reported as specified in the SEC&rsquo;s rules and forms.

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless
an internal control system
 no matter how well conceived and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance that
the objectives of the control system are met. Further
 the design of a control system reflects the fact that there are resource
constraints
 and the benefits of controls are considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
 within
the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty
and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally
 controls can be circumvented by the individual
acts of some persons
 by collusion of two or more people
 or by management override of the internal control. The design of any
system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
 and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time
 control may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The
General Corporation Law of Delaware provides that directors
 officers
 employees or agents of Delaware corporations are entitled
under certain circumstances
 to be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) and other liabilities actually and
reasonably incurred by them in connection with any suit brought against them in their capacity as a director
 officer
 employee
or agent
 if they acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of
the corporation
 and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding
 if they had no reasonable cause to believe their conduct
was unlawful. This statute provides that directors
 officers
 employees and agents may also be indemnified against expenses (including
attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection with a derivative suit brought against them in their capacity
as a director
 if they acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests
of the corporation
 except that no indemnification may be made without court approval if such person was adjudged liable to the
corporation.



    
    


Our
Certificate of Incorporation provides that we shall indemnify any and all persons whom we shall have power to indemnify to the
fullest extent permitted by the Delaware Corporate Law. Article VII of our By-Laws provides that we shall indemnify our authorized
representatives to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware Law. Our By-Laws also permit us to purchase insurance on behalf
of any such person against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any capacity
 or out of such
person's status as such
 whether or not we would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the foregoing
provision of the by-laws.

The
foregoing discussion of indemnification merely summarizes certain aspects of indemnification provisions and is limited by reference
to the above discussed sections of the Delaware Corporation Law.

The
Company's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that the Company may indemnify to the full extent of its power to do so
all directors
 officers
 employees
 and/or agents.&nbsp;&nbsp;Insofar as indemnification by the Company for liabilities arising
under the Securities Act may be permitted to officers and directors of the Company pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise
the Company is aware that in the opinion of the Commission
 such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the
Securities Act and is
 therefore
 unenforceable.

EVANS
BREWING COMPANY
 INC
(Formerly
ALPINE 3
 INC.)
NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
AS
OF DECEMBER 31
 2015 AND DECEMBER 31
 2014

NOTE
1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Evans
Brewing Company Inc. (formerly ALPINE 3 Inc.) (&ldquo;EBC&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) was incorporated under the laws
of the State of Delaware on June 18
 2013. Alpine 3 Inc. was set up to serve as a vehicle to effect an asset acquisition
 merger
exchange of capital stock
 or other business combination with a domestic or foreign business. Alpine 3 did not undertake any effort
to cause a market to develop in its securities
 either debt or equity
 before it successfully concluded a business combination.
On April 4
 2014
 The Michael J. Rapport Trust (the &ldquo;Trust&rdquo;) purchased 10
000
000 shares of common stock
 which was
all of the outstanding shares of Alpine 3
 from the founder of Alpine 3
 and changed the name to Evans Brewing Company Inc. on
May 29
 2014. On October 9
 2014
 the Trust agreed to the cancellation of 9
600
000 of the shares of common stock that it had
acquired and retained 400
000 shares of common stock.

On
October 15
 2014
 the Company entered into an Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement (the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) with Bayhawk
Ales
 Inc.
 a Delaware corporation (&ldquo;Bayhawk&rdquo;)
 subject to receiving approval of the independent Bayhawk shareholders
who vote on the transaction. On September 17
 2015
 the independent Bayhawk shareholders approved the agreement by a vote of 251
212
shares for and 1
600 shares against. As such
 Bayhawk sold to EBC
 and EBC purchased from Bayhawk
 assets of Bayhawk
 including
but not limited to: (A) all assets
 including personal property
 intellectual property
 inventory
 contracts
 websites
 documents
and all other assets however delineated relating to the Bayhawk Ales label (as defined in the Agreement and discussed in more
detail below); and (B) all assets
 including personal property
 intellectual property
 inventory
 contracts
 websites
 documents
and all other assets however delineated relating to the Evans Brands (as defined in the Agreement and discussed in more detail
below) (collectively
 the &ldquo;Transferred Assets&rdquo;). Bayhawk retained ownership of 100% of the stock in Evans Brewing
Co (CA) (&ldquo;Evans Brewing California&rdquo;) which has the brewers license at City Brewery in Lacrosse
 WI (where the non-craft
brands will be brewed
 with the balance of the craft brands being brewed in Irvine
 California). Based on the affirmative vote
by the independent Bayhawk shareholders to approve the Asset Purchase transaction
 EBC proceeded with the share exchange and tender
offer to the Bayhawk shareholders
 pursuant to which EBC offered to exchange shares of EBC common stock for shares of Bayhawk
common stock
 on a one-for-one basis (the &ldquo;Exchange Offer&rdquo;). Bayhawk shareholders had until December 2
 2015
 to tender
their Bayhawk shares in the share exchange. Bayhawk shareholders also had until December 2
 2015
 to rescind the exchange of shares.
There also was no minimum number of shares of Bayhawk common stock that must be tendered for the Exchange Offer to close. At the
close of the share exchange on December 2
 2015
 Premier Stock Transfer accepted on behalf of EBC 4
033
863 Bayhawk shares and
issued 4
033
863 shares of EBC common stock upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase and Share
Exchange Agreement by and between EBC and Bayhawk
 dated October 15
 2014
 as amended (the &ldquo;Asset Purchase Agreement&rdquo;).
EBC filed a copy of the Asset Purchase Agreement as an annex to a combination registration statement and proxy statement on Form
S-4. The Bayhawk shares were validly tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer and not withdrawn. The asset purchase and share exchange
will be treated as business combination as both companies are controlled by the same management.

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis
of Presentation

This
summary of accounting policies for EBC is presented to assist in understanding the Company&rsquo;s financial statements. The Company
uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&ldquo;U.S.
GAAP&rdquo;) and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.



    
    


Use
of Estimates and Assumptions

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates
are used when accounting for allowances for bad debts
 collectability of accounts receivable
 amounts due to service providers
depreciation and litigation contingencies
 among others.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents 

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows
 the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes. The Company had
no cash equivalents as of December 31
 2015 and 2014.

Accounts
Receivable

Accounts
receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms. EBC performs continuing credit evaluations of customers and
allowances are maintained for potential credit losses. EBC determined an allowance for doubtful accounts of $6
950 at December
31
 2015 and $11
966 for December 31
 2014
 to be appropriate.



Inventories
are valued at the lower of cost or market. EBC regularly reviews its inventories for the presence of obsolete product attributed
to age
 seasonality
 and quality and reduces its cost basis when its review indicates a reduction in utility below the inventory's
carrying value. Inventories consisted of the following at December 31
 2015 and 2014:

Insurance
Claim Receivable

During
the year ended December 31
 2014
 a fire in the California brewery occurred resulting in a short-term stoppage in operations
lost profits
 and direct repair expenses.&nbsp; Bayhawk was insured for these losses and estimated an insurance claim receivable
earned as of December 31
 2014
 of $300
000. Bayhawk received a payment of $25
000 from its insurance carrier as an advance on
the insurance claim during the year ended December 31
 2014. The insurance claim receivable and payment from its insurance carrier
is reflected in other income (expense) in the accompanying statement of operations. During the fiscal year ended December 31
2015
 the Company was paid $322
 410 on the claim. The claim receivable was offset and the additional funds of $22
410 were recorded
as other income.



For
the year ended December 31
 2015
 EBC had a can deposit of $135
000 with a third-party that cans its product. In the fiscal year
ended December 31
 2014 EBC had a fully refundable deposits of $86
000 related to the keg lease referenced in Note 4 in addition
to the can deposit of $135
000
 In the year ended December 31
 2015
 the Company purchased the kegs from the leasing company
applying the deposit amount of $86
000 to the purchase of the kegs. As of December 31
 2015 and 2014
 deposits aggregated $135
000
and $221
000
 respectively.



    
    


Property
and Equipment

Property
and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives:



    
    

    
    

    
    

    
    

    
    

    
    


EBC
capitalizes significant capital expenditures. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as expenses when incurred.
When assets are sold or retired
 the costs and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts
and any resulting gain or loss is included in the income. For the year ended December 31
 2014
 depreciation expense includes
the depreciation of assets held under capital leases. The Company bought out the lease during the year ended December 31
 2015
and is depreciating the asset over a longer period of time. Total depreciation expense for the years ended December 31
 2015 and
2014
 was $46
613 and $189
498
 respectively.

Impairment
of long-lived assets

EBC
evaluates its long-lived assets by measuring the carrying amount of the asset against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows
associated with them. At the time such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long lived assets
are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets
 the assets are adjusted to their fair values. No adjustment to
the carrying value of the assets has been made.

Accounts
Payable

Accounts
payable consists of unpaid expenses incurred in the normal course of business.

Refundable
deposits

EBC
distributes its draft beer in kegs that are owned by the Company. When a draft beer is shipped to the customer
 the Company collects
a refundable deposit and records a liability. Upon return of the keg
 the deposit is refunded to the customer and the liability
is reduced. As of December 31
 2015 and 2014
 EBC had refundable deposits in the amounts of $107
574 and $120
613
 respectively.
EBC accounts for the loss
 breakage
 and deterioration of the kegs by crediting the customer&rsquo;s deposits. The deposit approximates
EBC&rsquo;s cost of the keg. Any additional cost incurred for the loss
 breakage
 or deterioration of the kegs is then billed
to the customer. Management periodically reviews its refundable deposits for any loss allowance on loss
 breakage
 or deterioration
and has determined that no allowance was necessary as of December 31
 2015 and 2014.

Lease
Accounting

The
EBC lease that was in place in 2014 was accounted for under the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;)
Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) 840
 Leases. Minimum base rent for operating leases
 which generally have
escalating rentals over the terms of the leases
 are recorded on a straight-line basis over the initial lease term and those renewal
periods that are reasonably assured. As of December 31
 2014
 there was no liability for deferred rent. The leased equipment under
capital leases expired in 2015
 and the Company purchased the asset. The assets and liabilities under capital leases were recorded
at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the assets. The assets were amortized over
the lower of their related lease terms or their estimated productive lives. Amortization of assets under capital leases is included
in depreciation expense for 2014.

Revenue
Recognition


 are recognized
when the products are picked up by individual customers or shipped to wholesale customers. The following criteria are met before
revenue is recognized: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 shipment of product or pickup has occurred
 selling price
is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Product returns are allowed
 but are rare according to historical
records for past years. EBC continuously monitors and evaluates product returns. There was no allowance for product returns as
of December 31
 2015 and 2014.



    
    


Sales
Tax

EBC
excludes from its sales all sales taxes assessed to its customers. Sales taxes assessed are recorded as accrued liabilities on
the balance sheet until remitted to the state agencies.

Excise
Tax

The
federal government levies excise taxes on the sale of alcoholic beverages
 including beer. For brewers producing fewer than two
million barrels of beer per calendar year
 the federal excise tax is $7 per barrel on the first 60
000 barrels of beer removed
for consumption or sale during the calendar year. The state of California imposes excise taxes on the sale and distribution of
beer at a rate of $0.20 per gallon. Excise taxes due to federal and state agencies are not collected from customers. For the years
ended December 31
 2015 and 2014
 excise taxes amounted to approximately $71
534 and $99
000
 respectively
 which is treated as
a Cost of Goods sold.

Uncertain
Tax Positions

EBC
utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of the &ldquo;Expenses
&ndash; Income Taxes Topic&rdquo; of the FASB ASC. Under the asset and liability method
 deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers certain tax planning
strategies in its assessment as to the recoverability of its tax assets. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that the
tax rate changes. EBC recognizes
 in its financial statements
 the impact of a tax position
 if that position is more likely than
not to be sustained on audit
 based on technical merits of the position. There are no material unrecognized tax positions in the
financial statements.

EBC
accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB ASC 740 (formerly Financial Accounting Standards Boards Interpretation
No. 48
). FASB ASC 740 prescribes
a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition of uncertain tax positions taken or expected
to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation also provides guidance on recognition
 derecognition
 classification

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

Fair

and other accrued liabilities approximate cost because of their short maturities. The Company measures and reports fair value
in accordance with ASC 820
 &ldquo;Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure&rdquo; defines fair value
 establishes a framework for
measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value investments.



    
    


Fair
value
 as defined in ASC 820
 is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of an asset should reflect its highest and best
use by market participants
 principal (or most advantageous) markets
 and an in-use or an in-exchange valuation premise. The fair
value of a liability should reflect the risk of nonperformance
 which includes
 among other things
 the Company&rsquo;s credit
risk.

Valuation
techniques are generally classified into three categories: the market approach; the income approach; and the cost approach. The
selection and application of one or more of the techniques may require significant judgment and are primarily dependent upon the
characteristics of the asset or liability
 and the quality and availability of inputs. Valuation techniques used to measure fair
value under ASC 820 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. ASC 820 also provides
fair value hierarchy for inputs and resulting measurement as follows:

Level
1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;
The Company values it&rsquo;s available for sale securities using Level 1.

Level
2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities
in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that
are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities;
and

Level
3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant
to the fair values.

Fair
value measurements are required to be disclosed by the Level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements
in their entirety fall. Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (in Level 3 measurements) are subject to
expanded disclosure requirements including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances
 separately presenting changes
during the period attributable to the following: (i) total gains or losses for the period (realized and unrealized)
 segregating
those gains or losses included in earnings
 and a description of where those gains or losses included in earning are reported
in the statement of income.

Basic
Loss Per Share

Basic
income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average
number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net income available
to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average
number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity.

The
Company has no dilutive debt instruments.

The
FASB issued ASU 2015-11 in July

at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business

 disposal
The
amendments in this Update more closely align the measurement of inventory in GAAP with the measurement of inventory in International
For public
business entities
 the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim
periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities
 the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15
 2016
 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017. The amendments in this Update
should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.

The
FASB issued ASU 2014-15 on August 27
 2014
 providing guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties
in the financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity&rsquo;s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide
certain disclosures if &ldquo;conditions or events raise substantial doubt about [the] entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a
going concern.&rdquo; The ASU applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15
 2016
 and
interim periods thereafter
 with early adoption permitted.

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. &nbsp;These pronouncements did not have any material
impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed
 and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting
pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

the temporary differences between the carrying values of the Company&rsquo;s assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and their corresponding income tax basis. The temporary differences give rise to either a deferred tax asset or liability in the
consolidated financial statements
 which is computed by applying current statutory tax rates to taxable and deductible temporary
differences based upon the classification (i.e. current or non-current) of the asset or liability in the consolidated financial
statements which relates to the particular temporary difference. Deferred taxes related to differences which are not attributable
to a specific asset or liability are classified in accordance with the future period in which they are expected to reverse and
be recognized for income tax purposes. The long-term deferred tax assets are fully valued as of December 31
 2015.


 2015 and 2014
 the
components of the Company&rsquo;s deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily consist of temporary differences attributable to
differing methods of depreciation
 insurance claim receivables
 net operating losses
 allowances for obsolete inventory
 and reserves
for bad debt.



a federal rate of 34% so as to not overstate the deferred tax asset created from the significant federal net operating losses.&nbsp;
This is also consistent with EBC&rsquo;s prior year treatment to not overstate the deferred tax asset where the Company used a
25% tax rate. As of December 31
 2014
 the Company had gross net operating losses of more than $380
000 and state net operating
losses of more than $112
000.&nbsp; Also
 in the year ended December 31
 2014
 EBC had a profit of $146
043 but this included $300
000
for a claim receivable that is not taxable income. As such
 excluding the $300
000
 the Company had a net operating loss of $153
957
for the year ended December 31
 2014
 which further adds to the net operating losses.



25% rate to calculate the deferred tax assets and the current tax provision.&nbsp; Because of the startup costs of EBC and the
net operating losses earned by Bayhawk during the first few years in operation
 the Company has had to pay very little federal
income tax.&nbsp; In 2014 the Company paid no federal income tax and will have no tax obligation for 2015 as well.&nbsp; EBC management
expects that the Company will not pay any federal income tax in 2016 as well
 due to its significant net operating losses.

        the registrant&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the

 as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such
        evaluation; and

    
    
    

    
    


in the registrant&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant&rsquo;s most recent fiscal

 or is reasonably
likely to materially affect
 the registrant&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting; and




    


        certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed
 based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting
        to the registrant&rsquo;s auditors and the audit committee of registrant&rsquo;s board of directors (or persons performing
        the equivalent functions):

    
    

    
    


weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
the registrant&rsquo;s ability to record
 process
 summarize and report financial information; and

    
    
    

    
    


 whether or not material
 that
        involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant&rsquo;s internal control over
        financial reporting.

 2013. Alpine 3 Inc. was set up to serve as a vehicle to effect an asset acquisition
 merger
 exchange of capital stock
 or other business combination with a domestic or foreign business. Alpine 3 did not undertake any effort to cause a market to develop in its securities
 either debt or equity
 before it successfully concluded a business combination. On April 4
 2014
 The Michael J. Rapport Trust (the &amp;#8220;Trust&amp;#8221;) purchased 10
000
000 shares of common stock
 which was all of the outstanding shares of Alpine 3
 from the founder of Alpine 3
 and changed the name to Evans Brewing Company Inc. on May 29
 2014. On October 9
 2014
 the Trust agreed to the cancellation of 9
600
000 of the shares of common stock that it had acquired and retained 400
000 shares of common stock.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0px; text-align: justify; color: #000000; text-transform: none; text-indent: 36pt; letter-spacing: normal; word-spacing: 0px; white-space: normal; font-stretch: normal; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;&gt;&lt;font style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; font-stretch: normal;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0px; text-align: justify; color: #000000; text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; word-spacing: 0px; white-space: normal; font-stretch: normal; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;&gt;&lt;font style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; font-stretch: normal;&gt;On October 15
 2014
 the Company entered into an Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement (the &amp;#8220;Agreement&amp;#8221;) with Bayhawk Ales
 Inc.
 a Delaware corporation (&amp;#8220;Bayhawk&amp;#8221;)
 subject to receiving approval of the independent Bayhawk shareholders who vote on the transaction. On September 17
 2015
 the independent Bayhawk shareholders approved the agreement by a vote of 251
212 shares for and 1
600 shares against. As such
 Bayhawk sold to EBC
 and EBC purchased from Bayhawk
 assets of Bayhawk
 including but not limited to: (A) all assets
 including personal property
 intellectual property
 inventory
 contracts
 websites
 documents
 and all other assets however delineated relating to the Bayhawk Ales label (as defined in the Agreement and discussed in more detail below); and (B) all assets
 including personal property
 intellectual property
 inventory
 contracts
 websites
 documents
 and all other assets however delineated relating to the Evans Brands (as defined in the Agreement and discussed in more detail below) (collectively
 the &amp;#8220;Transferred Assets&amp;#8221;). Bayhawk retained ownership of 100% of the stock in Evans Brewing Co (CA) (&amp;#8220;Evans Brewing California&amp;#8221;) which has the brewers license at City Brewery in Lacrosse
 WI (where the non-craft brands will be brewed
 with the balance of the craft brands being brewed in Irvine
 California). Based on the affirmative vote by the independent Bayhawk shareholders to approve the Asset Purchase transaction
 EBC proceeded with the share exchange and tender offer to the Bayhawk shareholders
 pursuant to which EBC offered to exchange shares of EBC common stock for shares of Bayhawk common stock
 on a one-for-one basis (the &amp;#8220;Exchange Offer&amp;#8221;). Bayhawk shareholders had until December 2
 2015
 to tender their Bayhawk shares in the share exchange. Bayhawk shareholders also had until December 2
 2015
 to rescind the exchange of shares. There also was no minimum number of shares of Bayhawk common stock that must be tendered for the Exchange Offer to close. At the close of the share exchange on December 2
 2015
 Premier Stock Transfer accepted on behalf of EBC 4
033
863 Bayhawk shares and issued 4
033
863 shares of EBC common stock upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement by and between EBC and Bayhawk
 dated October 15
 2014

Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as expenses when incurred. When assets are sold or retired
 the costs and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts
 and any resulting gain or loss is included in the income. For the year ended December 31
 2014
 depreciation expense includes the depreciation of assets held under capital leases. The Company bought out the lease during the year ended December 31
 2015
 and is depreciating the asset over a longer period of time. Total depreciation expense for the years ended December 31
 2015 and 2014
 was $46

When a draft beer is shipped to the customer
 the Company collects a refundable deposit and records a liability. Upon return of the keg
 the deposit is refunded to the customer and the liability is reduced. As of December 31
 2015 and 2014
 EBC had refundable deposits in the amounts of $107
574 and $120
613
 respectively. EBC accounts for the loss
 breakage
 and deterioration of the kegs by crediting the customer&amp;#8217;s deposits. The deposit approximates EBC&amp;#8217;s cost of the keg. Any additional cost incurred for the loss
 breakage
 or deterioration of the kegs is then billed to the customer. Management periodically reviews its refundable deposits for any loss allowance on loss
 breakage
 or deterioration and has determined that no allowance was necessary as of December 31
 2015 and 2014.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0px; text-align: left; color: #000000; text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; word-spacing: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 1; font-stretch: normal; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;&gt;&lt;font style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; font-stretch: normal;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0px; text-align: justify; color: #000000; text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; word-spacing: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 1; font-stretch: normal; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;&gt;&lt;font style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; font-stretch: normal;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lease Accounting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0px; text-align: justify; color: #000000; text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; word-spacing: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 1; font-stretch: normal; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;&gt;&lt;font style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; font-stretch: normal;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0px; text-align: justify; color: #000000; text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; word-spacing: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 1; font-stretch: normal; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;&gt;&lt;font style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; font-stretch: normal;&gt;The EBC lease that was in place in 2014 was accounted for under the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&amp;#8220;ASC&amp;#8221;) 840
 Leases. Minimum base rent for operating leases
 which generally have escalating rentals over the terms of the leases
 are recorded on a straight-line basis over the initial lease term and those renewal periods that are reasonably assured. As of December 31
 2014
 there was no liability for deferred rent. The leased equipment under capital leases expired in 2015
 and the Company purchased the asset. The assets and liabilities under capital leases were recorded at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the assets. The assets were amortized over the lower of their related lease terms or their estimated productive lives. Amortization of assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense for 2014.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0px; text-align: justify; color: #000000; text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; word-spacing: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 1; font-stretch: normal; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;&gt;&lt;font style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; font-stretch: normal;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0px; text-align: justify; color: #000000; text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; word-spacing: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 1; font-stretch: normal; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;&gt;&lt;font style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times,

 including beer. For brewers producing fewer than two million barrels of beer per calendar year
 the federal excise tax is $7 per barrel on the first 60

 excise taxes amounted to approximately $71

 method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of the &amp;#8220;Expenses &amp;#8211; Income Taxes Topic&amp;#8221; of the FASB ASC. Under the asset and liability method
 deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers certain tax planning strategies in its assessment as to the recoverability of its tax assets. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that the tax rate changes. EBC recognizes
 in its financial statements
 the impact of a tax position
 if that position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit
 based on technical merits of the position. There are no material unrecognized tax positions in the financial statements.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0px; text-align: justify; color: #000000; text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; word-spacing: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 1; font-stretch: normal; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;&gt;&lt;font style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; font-stretch: normal;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0px; text-align: justify; color: #000000; text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; word-spacing: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 1; font-stretch: normal; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;&gt;&lt;font style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; font-stretch: normal;&gt;EBC accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB ASC 740 (formerly Financial Accounting Standards Boards Interpretation No. 48

 is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the

 2015
 the Company accrued $1
500 of interest on this note. For the year ended December 31

The temporary differences give rise to either a deferred tax asset or liability in the consolidated financial statements
 which is computed by applying current statutory tax rates to taxable and deductible temporary differences based upon the classification (i.e. current or non-current) of the asset or liability in the consolidated financial statements which relates to the particular temporary difference. Deferred taxes related to differences which are not attributable to a specific asset or liability are classified in accordance with the future period in which they are expected to reverse and be recognized for income tax purposes. The long-term deferred tax assets are fully valued as of December 31
 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

 the components of the Company&amp;#8217;s deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily consist of temporary differences attributable to differing methods of depreciation
 insurance claim receivables
 net operating losses
 allowances for obsolete inventory
 and reserves for bad debt.&lt;/p&gt;

As of December 31
 2014
 the Company had gross net operating losses of more than $380
000 and state net operating losses of more than $112
000.&amp;#160; Also
 in the year ended December 31
 2014
 EBC had a profit of $146
043 but this included $300
000 for a claim receivable that is not taxable income. As such
 excluding the $300
000
 the Company had a net operating loss of $153
957 for the year ended December 31
 2014
 which further adds to the net operating losses.&lt;/p&gt;

 the Company has had to pay very little federal income tax.&amp;#160; In 2014 the Company paid no federal income tax and will have no tax obligation for 2015 as well.&amp;#160; EBC management expects that the Company will not pay any federal income tax in 2016 as well
 due to its significant net operating losses.&lt;/p&gt;

 2015 and 2014
 EBC had refundable deposits in the amounts of $107
574 and $120
613

 breakage
 or deterioration of the kegs is then billed to the customer. Management periodically reviews its refundable deposits for any loss allowance on loss
 breakage
 or deterioration and has determined that no allowance was necessary as of December 31

 deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers certain tax planning strategies in its assessment as to the recoverability of its tax assets. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that the tax rate changes. EBC recognizes
 in its financial statements
 the impact of a tax position
 if that position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit
 based on technical merits of the position. There are no material unrecognized tax positions in the financial statements.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0px; text-align: justify; color: #000000; text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; word-spacing: 0px; white-space: normal; font-stretch: normal; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;&gt;&lt;font style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; font-stretch: normal;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0px; text-align: justify; color: #000000; text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; word-spacing: 0px; white-space: normal; font-stretch: normal; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;&gt;&lt;font style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; font-stretch: normal;&gt;EBC accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB ASC 740 (formerly Financial Accounting Standards Boards Interpretation No. 48

 as defined in ASC 820
 is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of an asset should reflect its highest and best use by market participants
 principal (or most advantageous) markets
 and an in-use or an in-exchange valuation premise. The fair value of a liability should reflect the risk of nonperformance
 which includes
 among other things
 the Company&amp;#8217;s credit risk.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0px; text-align: justify; color: #000000; text-transform: none; text-indent: 0.5in; letter-spacing: normal; word-spacing: 0px; white-space: normal; font-stretch: normal; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;&gt;&lt;font style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; font-stretch: normal;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0px; text-align: justify; color: #000000; text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; word-spacing: 0px; white-space: normal; font-stretch: normal; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;&gt;&lt;font style=font: 10pt/normal 'times new roman', times, serif; font-stretch: normal;&gt;Valuation techniques are generally classified into three categories: the market approach; the income approach; and the cost approach. The selection and application of one or more of the techniques may require significant judgment and are primarily dependent upon the characteristics of the asset or liability
 and the quality and availability of inputs. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value under ASC 820 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.

Evans Brewing Company Inc. (formerly ALPINE 3 Inc.) (&#8220;EBC&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 18
 2013. Alpine 3 Inc. was set up to serve as a vehicle to effect an asset acquisition
 merger
 exchange of capital stock
 or other business combination with a domestic or foreign business. Alpine 3 did not undertake any effort to cause a market to develop in its securities
 either debt or equity
 before it successfully concluded a business combination. On April 4
 2014
 The Michael J. Rapport Trust (the &#8220;Trust&#8221;) purchased 10
000
000 shares of common stock
 which was all of the outstanding shares of Alpine 3
 from the founder of Alpine 3
 and changed the name to Evans Brewing Company Inc. on May 29
 2014. On October 9
 2014
 the Trust agreed to the cancellation of 9
600
000 of the shares of common stock that it had acquired and retained 400
On October 15
 2014
 the Company entered into an Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with Bayhawk Ales
 Inc.
 a Delaware corporation (&#8220;Bayhawk&#8221;)
 subject to receiving approval of the independent Bayhawk shareholders who vote on the transaction. On September 17
 2015
 the independent Bayhawk shareholders approved the agreement by a vote of 251
212 shares for and 1
600 shares against. As such
 Bayhawk sold to EBC
 and EBC purchased from Bayhawk
 assets of Bayhawk
 including but not limited to: (A) all assets
 including personal property
 intellectual property
 inventory
 contracts
 websites
 documents
 and all other assets however delineated relating to the Bayhawk Ales label (as defined in the Agreement and discussed in more detail below); and (B) all assets
 including personal property
 intellectual property
 inventory
 contracts
 websites
 documents
 and all other assets however delineated relating to the Evans Brands (as defined in the Agreement and discussed in more detail below) (collectively
 the &#8220;Transferred Assets&#8221;). Bayhawk retained ownership of 100% of the stock in Evans Brewing Co (CA) (&#8220;Evans Brewing California&#8221;) which has the brewers license at City Brewery in Lacrosse
 WI (where the non-craft brands will be brewed
 with the balance of the craft brands being brewed in Irvine
 California). Based on the affirmative vote by the independent Bayhawk shareholders to approve the Asset Purchase transaction
 EBC proceeded with the share exchange and tender offer to the Bayhawk shareholders
 pursuant to which EBC offered to exchange shares of EBC common stock for shares of Bayhawk common stock
 on a one-for-one basis (the &#8220;Exchange Offer&#8221;). Bayhawk shareholders had until December 2
 2015
 to tender their Bayhawk shares in the share exchange. Bayhawk shareholders also had until December 2
 2015
 to rescind the exchange of shares. There also was no minimum number of shares of Bayhawk common stock that must be tendered for the Exchange Offer to close. At the close of the share exchange on December 2
 2015
 Premier Stock Transfer accepted on behalf of EBC 4
033
863 Bayhawk shares and issued 4

863 shares of EBC common stock upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement by and between EBC and Bayhawk
 dated October 15
 2014
 as amended (the &#8220;Asset Purchase Agreement&#8221;). EBC filed a copy of the Asset Purchase Agreement as an annex to a combination registration statement and proxy statement on Form S-4. The Bayhawk shares were validly tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer and not withdrawn. The asset purchase and share exchange will be treated as business combination as both companies are controlled by the same management.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used when accounting for allowances for bad debts
 collectability of accounts receivable
 amounts due to service providers
 depreciation and litigation contingencies
For purposes of the statement of cash flows
 the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes. The Company had no cash equivalents as of December 31
Accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms. EBC performs continuing credit evaluations of customers and allowances are maintained for potential credit losses. EBC determined an allowance for doubtful accounts of $6
950 at December 31
 2015 and $11
966 for December 31
 2014
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. EBC regularly reviews its inventories for the presence of obsolete product attributed to age
 seasonality
 and quality and reduces its cost basis when its review indicates a reduction in utility below the inventory's carrying value. Inventories consisted of the following at December 31

During the year ended December 31
 2014
 a fire in the California brewery occurred resulting in a short-term stoppage in operations
 lost profits
 and direct repair expenses.&#160; Bayhawk was insured for these losses and estimated an insurance claim receivable earned as of December 31
 2014
 of $300
000. Bayhawk received a payment of $25
000 from its insurance carrier as an advance on the insurance claim during the year ended December 31
 2014. The insurance claim receivable and payment from its insurance carrier is reflected in other income (expense) in the accompanying statement of operations. During the fiscal year ended December 31
 2015
 the Company was paid $322
 410 on the claim. The claim receivable was offset and the additional funds of $22
For the year ended December 31
 2015
 EBC had a can deposit of $135
000 with a third-party that cans its product. In the fiscal year ended December 31
 2014 EBC had a fully refundable deposits of $86
000 related to the keg lease referenced in Note 4 in addition to the can deposit of $135
000
 In the year ended December 31
 2015
 the Company purchased the kegs from the leasing company
 applying the deposit amount of $86
000 to the purchase of the kegs. As of December 31
 2015 and 2014
 deposits aggregated $135
000
 and $221
000
EBC capitalizes significant capital expenditures. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as expenses when incurred. When assets are sold or retired
 the costs and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts
 and any resulting gain or loss is included in the income. For the year ended December 31
 2014
 depreciation expense includes the depreciation of assets held under capital leases. The Company bought out the lease during the year ended December 31
 2015
 and is depreciating the asset over a longer period of time. Total depreciation expense for the years ended December 31
 2015 and 2014
 was $46
613 and $189
498
EBC evaluates its long-lived assets by measuring the carrying amount of the asset against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them. At the time such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets
EBC distributes its draft beer in kegs that are owned by the Company. When a draft beer is shipped to the customer
 the Company collects a refundable deposit and records a liability. Upon return of the keg
 the deposit is refunded to the customer and the liability is reduced. As of December 31
 2015 and 2014
 EBC had refundable deposits in the amounts of $107
574 and $120
613
 respectively. EBC accounts for the loss
 breakage
 and deterioration of the kegs by crediting the customer&#8217;s deposits. The deposit approximates EBC&#8217;s cost of the keg. Any additional cost incurred for the loss
 breakage
 or deterioration of the kegs is then billed to the customer. Management periodically reviews its refundable deposits for any loss allowance on loss
 breakage
 or deterioration and has determined that no allowance was necessary as of December 31
The EBC lease that was in place in 2014 was accounted for under the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 840
 Leases. Minimum base rent for operating leases
 which generally have escalating rentals over the terms of the leases
 are recorded on a straight-line basis over the initial lease term and those renewal periods that are reasonably assured. As of December 31
 2014
 there was no liability for deferred rent. The leased equipment under capital leases expired in 2015
Revenue from product sales
 are recognized when the products are picked up by individual customers or shipped to wholesale customers. The following criteria are met before revenue is recognized: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 shipment of product or pickup has occurred
 selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Product returns are allowed
 but are rare according to historical records for past years. EBC continuously monitors and evaluates product returns. There was no allowance for product returns as of December 31
The federal government levies excise taxes on the sale of alcoholic beverages
 including beer. For brewers producing fewer than two million barrels of beer per calendar year
 the federal excise tax is $7 per barrel on the first 60
000 barrels of beer removed for consumption or sale during the calendar year. The state of California imposes excise taxes on the sale and distribution of beer at a rate of $0.20 per gallon. Excise taxes due to federal and state agencies are not collected from customers. For the years ended December 31
 2015 and 2014
 excise taxes amounted to approximately $71
534 and $99
000
 respectively
EBC utilizes the asset and liability
 method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of the &#8220;Expenses &#8211; Income Taxes Topic&#8221; of the FASB ASC. Under the asset and liability method
 deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers certain tax planning strategies in its assessment as to the recoverability of its tax assets. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that the tax rate changes. EBC recognizes
 in its financial statements
 the impact of a tax position
 if that position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit
EBC accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB ASC 740 (formerly Financial Accounting Standards Boards Interpretation No. 48
). FASB ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation also provides guidance on recognition
 derecognition
 classification
 interest and penalties
 accounting in interim periods
For federal tax purposes the Company&#8217;s 2012 through 2015 tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities under normal three-year statute of limitations. Generally
 for state tax purposes
Fair value of certain of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments including cash
 account payable
 accrued expenses
 notes payables
 and other accrued liabilities approximate cost because of their short maturities. The Company measures and reports fair value in accordance with ASC 820
 &#8220;Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure&#8221; defines fair value
Fair value
 as defined in ASC 820
 is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
 measurement date. The fair value of an asset should reflect its highest and best use by market participants
 principal (or most advantageous) markets
 and an in-use or an in-exchange valuation premise. The fair value of a liability should reflect the risk of nonperformance
 which includes
 among other things
Valuation techniques are generally classified into three categories: the market approach; the income approach; and the cost approach. The selection and application of one or more of the techniques may require significant judgment and are primarily dependent upon the characteristics of the asset or liability
Fair value measurements are required to be disclosed by the Level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements in their entirety fall. Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (in Level 3 measurements) are subject to expanded disclosure requirements including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances
 separately presenting changes during the period attributable to the following: (i) total gains or losses for the period (realized and unrealized)
 segregating those gains or losses included in earnings
The FASB issued ASU 2015-11 in July
 2015
 to provide guidance on how an entity should measure inventory within the scope of this Update at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal
For public business entities
 the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities
 the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2016
 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15
The FASB issued ASU 2014-15 on August 27
 2014
 providing guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if &#8220;conditions or events raise substantial doubt about [the] entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern.&#8221; The ASU applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15
 2016
 and interim periods thereafter
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. &#160;These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed
 and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

Deferred taxes related to differences which are not attributable to a specific asset or liability are classified in accordance with the future period in which they are expected to reverse and be recognized for income tax purposes. The long-term deferred tax assets are fully valued as of December 31
 2015.


 2015 and 2014
 the components of the Company&#8217;s deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily consist of temporary differences attributable to differing methods of depreciation
 insurance claim receivables
 net operating losses
 allowances for obsolete inventory
 and reserves for bad debt.



 2014
 the Company had gross net operating losses of more than $380
000 and state net operating losses of more than $112
000.&#160; Also
 in the year ended December 31
 2014
 EBC had a profit of $146
043 but this included $300
000 for a claim receivable that is not taxable income. As such
 excluding the $300
000
 the Company had a net operating loss of $153
957 for the year ended December 31
 2014
 which further adds to the net operating losses.



 the Company has had to pay very little federal income tax.&#160; In 2014 the Company paid no federal income tax and will have no tax obligation for 2015 as well.&#160; EBC management expects that the Company will not pay any federal income tax in 2016 as well
 due to its significant net operating losses.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used when accounting for allowances for bad debts
 collectability of accounts receivable
 amounts due to service providers
 depreciation and litigation contingencies
 among others.




For purposes of the statement of cash flows
 the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes. The Company had no cash equivalents as of December 31
 2015 and 2014.




Accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms. EBC performs continuing credit evaluations of customers and allowances are maintained for potential credit losses. EBC determined an allowance for doubtful accounts of $6
950 at December 31
 2015 and $11
966 for December 31
 2014
 to be appropriate.




Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. EBC regularly reviews its inventories for the presence of obsolete product attributed to age
 seasonality
 and quality and reduces its cost basis when its review indicates a reduction in utility below the inventory's carrying value. Inventories consisted of the following at December 31

During the year ended December 31
 2014
 a fire in the California brewery occurred resulting in a short-term stoppage in operations
 lost profits
 and direct repair expenses.&#160; Bayhawk was insured for these losses and estimated an insurance claim receivable earned as of December 31
 2014
 of $300
000. Bayhawk received a payment of $25
000 from its insurance carrier as an advance on the insurance claim during the year ended December 31
 2014. The insurance claim receivable and payment from its insurance carrier is reflected in other income (expense) in the accompanying statement of operations. During the fiscal year ended December 31
 2015
 the Company was paid $322
 410 on the claim. The claim receivable was offset and the additional funds of $22
410 were recorded as other income.




For the year ended December 31
 2015
 EBC had a can deposit of $135
000 with a third-party that cans its product. In the fiscal year ended December 31
 2014 EBC had a fully refundable deposits of $86
000 related to the keg lease referenced in Note 4 in addition to the can deposit of $135
000
 In the year ended December 31
 2015
 the Company purchased the kegs from the leasing company
 applying the deposit amount of $86
000 to the purchase of the kegs. As of December 31
 2015 and 2014
 deposits aggregated $135
000
 and $221
000
 respectively.




EBC capitalizes significant capital expenditures. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as expenses when incurred. When assets are sold or retired
 the costs and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts
 and any resulting gain or loss is included in the income. For the year ended December 31
 2014
 depreciation expense includes the depreciation of assets held under capital leases. The Company bought out the lease during the year ended December 31
 2015
 and is depreciating the asset over a longer period of time. Total depreciation expense for the years ended December 31
 2015 and 2014
 was $46
613 and $189
498
 respectively.




EBC evaluates its long-lived assets by measuring the carrying amount of the asset against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them. At the time such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets
 the assets are adjusted to their fair values. No adjustment to the carrying value of the assets has been made.









EBC distributes its draft beer in kegs that are owned by the Company. When a draft beer is shipped to the customer
 the Company collects a refundable deposit and records a liability. Upon return of the keg
 the deposit is refunded to the customer and the liability is reduced. As of December 31
 2015 and 2014
 EBC had refundable deposits in the amounts of $107
574 and $120
613
 respectively. EBC accounts for the loss
 breakage
 and deterioration of the kegs by crediting the customer&#8217;s deposits. The deposit approximates EBC&#8217;s cost of the keg. Any additional cost incurred for the loss
 breakage
 or deterioration of the kegs is then billed to the customer. Management periodically reviews its refundable deposits for any loss allowance on loss
 breakage
 or deterioration and has determined that no allowance was necessary as of December 31
 2015 and 2014.




The EBC lease that was in place in 2014 was accounted for under the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 840
 Leases. Minimum base rent for operating leases
 which generally have escalating rentals over the terms of the leases
 are recorded on a straight-line basis over the initial lease term and those renewal periods that are reasonably assured. As of December 31
 2014
 there was no liability for deferred rent. The leased equipment under capital leases expired in 2015
 and the Company purchased the asset. The assets and liabilities under capital leases were recorded at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the assets. The assets were amortized over the lower of their related lease terms or their estimated productive lives. Amortization of assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense for 2014.




Revenue from product sales
 are recognized when the products are picked up by individual customers or shipped to wholesale customers. The following criteria are met before revenue is recognized: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 shipment of product or pickup has occurred
 selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Product returns are allowed
 but are rare according to historical records for past years. EBC continuously monitors and evaluates product returns. There was no allowance for product returns as of December 31
 2015 and 2014.









The federal government levies excise taxes on the sale of alcoholic beverages
 including beer. For brewers producing fewer than two million barrels of beer per calendar year
 the federal excise tax is $7 per barrel on the first 60
000 barrels of beer removed for consumption or sale during the calendar year. The state of California imposes excise taxes on the sale and distribution of beer at a rate of $0.20 per gallon. Excise taxes due to federal and state agencies are not collected from customers. For the years ended December 31
 2015 and 2014
 excise taxes amounted to approximately $71
534 and $99
000
 respectively
 which is treated as a Cost of Goods sold.




EBC utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of the &#8220;Expenses &#8211; Income Taxes Topic&#8221; of the FASB ASC. Under the asset and liability method
 deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers certain tax planning strategies in its assessment as to the recoverability of its tax assets. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that the tax rate changes. EBC recognizes
 in its financial statements
 the impact of a tax position
 if that position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit
EBC accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB ASC 740 (formerly Financial Accounting Standards Boards Interpretation No. 48
). FASB ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation also provides guidance on recognition
 derecognition
 classification
 interest and penalties
 accounting in interim periods
For federal tax purposes the Company&#8217;s 2012 through 2015 tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities under normal three-year statute of limitations. Generally
 for state tax purposes
 the Company&#8217;s 2011 through 2015 tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities under a four-year statute of limitations




Fair value of certain of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments including cash
 account payable
 accrued expenses
 notes payables
 and other accrued liabilities approximate cost because of their short maturities. The Company measures and reports fair value in accordance with ASC 820
 &#8220;Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure&#8221; defines fair value
Fair value
 as defined in ASC 820
 is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of an asset should reflect its highest and best use by market participants
 principal (or most advantageous) markets
 and an in-use or an in-exchange valuation premise. The fair value of a liability should reflect the risk of nonperformance
 which includes
 among other things
Valuation techniques are generally classified into three categories: the market approach; the income approach; and the cost approach. The selection and application of one or more of the techniques may require significant judgment and are primarily dependent upon the characteristics of the asset or liability
Fair value measurements are required to be disclosed by the Level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements in their entirety fall. Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (in Level 3 measurements) are subject to expanded disclosure requirements including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances
 separately presenting changes during the period attributable to the following: (i) total gains or losses for the period (realized and unrealized)
 segregating those gains or losses included in earnings
 and a description of where those gains or losses included in earning are reported in the statement of income.









The FASB issued ASU 2015-11 in July
 2015
 to provide guidance on how an entity should measure inventory within the scope of this Update at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal
For public business entities
 the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities
 the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2016
 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15
The FASB issued ASU 2014-15 on August 27
 2014
 providing guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if &#8220;conditions or events raise substantial doubt about [the] entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern.&#8221; The ASU applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15
 2016
 and interim periods thereafter
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. &#160;These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed
 and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
