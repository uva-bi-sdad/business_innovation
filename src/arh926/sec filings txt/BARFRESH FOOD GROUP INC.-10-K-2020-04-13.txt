PART

Item
1. Business.

Business
Overview

Barfresh
is a leader in the creation
 manufacturing and distribution of ready to blend frozen beverages. The current portfolio of products
includes smoothies
 shakes and frappes. Products are packaged in two distinct formats.

The
Company&rsquo;s original single serve format features portion controlled and ready to blend beverage ingredient packs or &ldquo;beverage
packs&rdquo;. The beverage packs contain all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage
 including the base (either
sorbet
 frozen yogurt or ice cream)
 real fruit pieces
 juices and ice &ndash; five ounces of water are added before blending.

The
Company&rsquo;s bulk &ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo; format also contains all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage
packaged in gallon containers in a concentrated formula that is mixed &ldquo;one to one&rdquo; with water. The Company has a &ldquo;no
sugar added&rdquo; version of the bulk &ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo; format that is specifically targeted for the USDA national school
meal program
 including the School Breakfast Program
 the National School Lunch Program
 and Smart Snacks in Schools Program.
The Company is currently in contract to sell its bulk Easy Pour products into over three hundred schools. In addition
 the Company
received approval from the United States Defense Logistics Agency (&ldquo;DLA&rdquo;) to sell its smoothie products into all branches
of the U.S. Armed Forces
 and is currently in contract with and selling its bulk Easy Pour products into over one hundred military
bases in the United States and abroad.

Domestic
and international patents and patents pending are owned by Barfresh
 as well as related trademarks for all of the single serve
products. Patent rights have been granted in 13 jurisdictions including the United States. In addition
 the Company has purchased
all of the trademarks related to the patented products.

The
Company conducts sales through several channels
 including National Accounts
 Regional Accounts
 and Broadline Distributors. Barfresh&rsquo;s
primary broadline distribution arrangement is through an exclusive nationwide agreement with Sysco Corporation (&ldquo;Sysco&rdquo;)
the U.S.&rsquo;s largest broadline distributor
 which was entered into in July 2014.

Pursuant
to that agreement
 all Barfresh products are included in Sysco&rsquo;s national core selection of beverage items
 making Barfresh
its exclusive single-serve
 pre-portioned beverage provider. The agreement is mutually exclusive; however
 Barfresh may also sell
the products to other foodservice distributors
 but only to the extent required for such foodservice distributors to service multi-unit
chain operators with at least 20 units and where Sysco is not such multi- unit chain operator&rsquo;s nominated distributor for
our products. On October 2
 2019
 the exclusive distribution agreement with Sysco expired
 opening the possibility to expand distribution
with other distributors outside of the Sysco system.

During
2016 and 2017 the Company announced that it had signed supply agreements with several of the major global on-site foodservice
operators. On March 8
 2018
 the Company announced that it had signed a new supply agreement with one of the largest of these
foodservice operators
 for exclusive distribution of four of Barfresh&rsquo;s single serve skus. On November 14
 2018
the Company announced that it had received approval for multiple products to be rolled out to a national restaurant chain with
over 2
500 locations.

On
October 26
 2015
 Barfresh signed a five year agreement with PepsiCo North America Beverages
 a division of PepsiCo
 to become
its exclusive sales representative within the food service channel to present Barfresh&rsquo;s line of ready-to-blend smoothies
and frozen beverages throughout the United States and Canada. Through this agreement
 Barfresh&rsquo; products are included as
part of PepsiCo&rsquo;s offerings to its significant customer base. The agreement facilitates access to potential National customer
accounts
 through introductions provided by PepsiCo&rsquo;s one-thousand plus person foodservice sales team. Barfresh products
have become part of PepsiCo&rsquo;s customer presentations at national trade shows and similar venues.

Barfresh
utilizes contract manufacturers to manufacture all of its products in the United States. Production lines are currently operational
at two locations. The first location is in Salt Lake City
 which currently produces both bulk easy pour and single serve products.
Annual production capacity with this contract manufacturer is 14 million units per year. The second location is with Yarnell Operations
LLC.
 a subsidiary of Schulze and Burch Biscuit Co.
 located in Arkansas. The Yarnell&rsquo;s agreement
 which was signed
during February 2016
 and secures the capacity to ramp up to an incremental production capacity of 100 million units. Yarnell&rsquo;s
location enhances the company&rsquo;s ability to efficiently move product throughout the supply chain to destinations in the eastern
United States
 home to many of the country&rsquo;s large foodservice outlets.

Our
corporate office is located at 3600 Wilshire Boulevard Suite 1720
 Los Angeles
 90010. Our telephone number is (310) 598-7113

Company
 which was incorporated in Delaware on February 25

Reorganization
and Recapitalization

During
January 2012
 the Company entered into a series of transactions pursuant to which Barfresh Inc.
 a Colorado corporation
(&ldquo;Barfresh NV&rdquo;)
 was acquired
 spun-out prior operations to the former principal shareholder
 completed a private
offering of securities for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1
000
000
 conducted a four for one forward stock
split and changed the name of the Company. The following describes the steps of this reorganization:



    
    
Acquisition
    of Barfresh NV. 
333
328
    shares of our $0.000001 par value common stock pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement between us
 our former principal shareholder
    Barfresh NV and the former shareholders of Barfresh NV. As a result of this transaction
 Barfresh NV became our wholly owned
    subsidiary and the former shareholders of Barfresh NV became our controlling shareholders.

    
    
    

    
    
Spinout
    of prior business. 
 we spun-out our previous business operations to
    a former officer
 director and principal shareholder
 in exchange for all of the shares of our common stock held by that person.
    Such shares were cancelled immediately following the acquisition.

    
    
    

    
    
Financing
    transaction
 we sold an aggregate of 1
333
332 shares of our common
    stock and five-year warrants to purchase 1
333
332 shares of common stock at a per share exercise price of $1.50 in a private
    offering for gross proceeds of $999
998
 less expenses of $26
895.

    
    
    

    
    
Change
    of name
 we changed the name of the Company from Moving Box Inc. to Barfresh Food Group Inc.
    Barfresh Food Group Inc. has two direct subsidiaries; Barfresh Corporation
 Inc
 (formerly known as Smoothie
 Inc.) and Barfresh
    Inc.

    
    
    

    
    
Forward
    stock split
 we conducted a four for one forward stock split of the Company&rsquo;s common stock.




The
Company&rsquo;s products are made in two formats. The first is in portion controlled single serving beverage ingredient packs
suitable for smoothies
 shakes and frappes that can also be utilized for cocktails and mocktails. These packs contain all of the
ingredients necessary to make a smoothie
 shake or frappe
 including the ice. Simply add water
 empty the packet into a blender
blend and serve. The second format is the bulk &ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo; format. The Company&rsquo;s bulk &ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo;
format also contains all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage
 packaged in gallon containers in a concentrated
formula that is mixed &ldquo;one to one&rdquo; with water.

Customer
Marketing Material

A
wide range of consumer marketing materials has been created to assist customers in selling blended beverages.



Research
and Development

The
Company incurred research and development expenses for the year ended December 31
 2019 in the amount of $538
391 and for the
year ended December 31
 2018 in the amount of $674
224. The decrease in Research and Development expenses was primarily attributable
to reduced activity in creating unique flavors for potential customers in our national account pipeline.



    
    




There
is significant competition in the smoothie market at both the consumer purchasing level and also the product level.

The
competition at the consumer level is primarily between specialized juice bars (e.g. Jamba Juice) and major fast casual and fast
food restaurant chains (such as McDonalds). Barfresh does not compete specifically at this level but intends to supply its product
to customers that fall within these segments to enable them to compete for consumer demand.

There
may also be new entrants to the smoothie market that may alter the current competitor landscape.

The
existing competition from a product perspective can be separated into three categories:

&#9679;
Specialized juice bar products: The product is made in-store and each ingredient is added separately.

&#9679;
Syrup based products: The fruit puree is supplied in bulk and not portion controlled for each smoothie. These types of products
still require the addition of juice
 milk or water and/or yogurt and ice. While there are a number of competitors for this style
of product
 the two dominant competitors are Island Oasis and Minute Maid.

&#9679;
Portion pack products: These products contain only the fruit and yogurt and require the addition of juice or milk and ice. The
dominant competitor is General Mills&rsquo; Yoplait Smoothies.

The
Company believes that its single serve products afford a very significant competitive advantage based on ease of use
 portion
control
 premium quality
 and minimal capital investment required to enable a customer to begin to carry Barfresh beverage products.
The Company also believes that its bulk &ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo; product represents an attractive alternative delivery method for
customers that serve high volume locations
 where speed of service over extended periods is a critical requirement. The Company
has recently launched a &ldquo;no sugar added&rdquo; version of the bulk &ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo; format that is specifically targeted
for the USDA national school meal program
 including the School Breakfast Program
 the National School Lunch Program
 and Smart
Snacks in Schools Program.

Intellectual
Property

Barfresh
owns the domestic and intellectual property rights to its products&rsquo; sealed pack of ingredients used in its single serve
products.

In
November 2011
 the Company acquired patent applications filed in the United States (Patent Application number 11/660415) and Canada
(Patent Application number 2577163) from certain related parties. The United States patent was originally filed on December 4
2007 and it was granted during August of 2017. The Canadian patent was originally filed on August 16
 2005 and it was granted
on May 27
 2014.

On
October 15
 2013
 the Company acquired all of the related international patent rights
 which were filed pursuant to the Patent
Cooperation Treaty
 have been granted in 13 jurisdictions and are pending in the remainder of the jurisdictions that have signed
the PCT. In addition
 the Company purchased all of the trademarks related to the patented products.

Governmental
Approval and Regulation

The
Company is not aware of the need for any governmental approvals of its products.

The
Company utilizes contract manufacturers. Before entering into any manufacturing contracts
 the Company determines that the manufacturer
meets all government requirements.

Environmental
Laws

The
Company does not believe that it will be subject to any environmental laws
 either state or federal. Any laws concerning manufacturing
will be the responsibility of the contract manufacturer.



    
    




The
Company currently has 17 employees and 2 consultants. There are currently 12 employees selling our products.

Item
1A. Risk Factors

An
investment in the Company&rsquo;s securities involves significant risks
 including the risks described below. The risks included
below are not the only ones that the Company faces. Additional risks presently unknown to us or that we currently consider immaterial
or unlikely to occur could also impair our operations. If any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any such additional
risks and uncertainties actually occur
 our business
 prospects
 financial condition or results of operations could be negatively
affected.

The
impact of COVID-19 on the Company is evolving rapidly with events unfolding on a daily and weekly basis. The direct impact to
our operations has begun to take affect at the close of the first quarter ended March 31
 2020. Specifically
 our business has
been impacted by dining bans targeted at restaurants to reduce the size of public gatherings. We have noted restaurant chains
have closed operations and furloughed employees which would preclude our single serve products from being served at those establishments
for a number of weeks. Furthermore
 many school districts have closed regular attendance which could conceivably last to the end
of the school year. This will directly impact the sales of our Bulk Product into that sales channel. Our headquarters are located
in Los Angeles
 California
 where the entire state has been issued a &ldquo;shelter in place&rdquo; order from the Governor of
California. Consequently
 our staff in the headquarter office are working remotely until further notice. At this point
 we have
not experienced a disruption in the supply chain for manufacturing our products. The developments surrounding COVID-19 remain
fluid and dynamic
 and consequently
 will require the Company to continue to monitor news headlines from government and health
officials
 as well as
 the business community.

Risks
Related to Our Business

We
have a history of operating losses

We
have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability. These operating losses have been generated while
we market to potential customers. We cannot guarantee that we will become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability
 given
the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we operate
 we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability
and our failure to do so would adversely affect the Company&rsquo;s business
 including our ability to raise additional funds.

If
we continue to suffer losses from operations
 our working capital may be insufficient to support our ability to expand our business
operations as rapidly as we would deem necessary at any time
 unless we are able to obtain additional financing. There can be
no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms
 or at all. If adequate funds are not available
or are not available on acceptable terms
 we may not be able to pursue our business objectives and would be required to reduce
our level of operations
 including reducing infrastructure
 promotions
 sales and marketing programs
 personnel and other operating
expenses. These events could adversely affect our business
 results of operations and financial condition. If adequate funds are
not available or if they are not available on acceptable terms
 our ability to fund the growth of our operations
 take advantage
of opportunities
 develop products or services or otherwise respond to competitive pressures
 could be significantly limited.

We
may need additional financing in the future
 which may not be available when needed or may be costly and dilutive.

We
may require additional financing to support our working capital needs in the future. The amount of additional capital we may require
the timing of our capital needs and the availability of financing to fund those needs will depend on a number of factors
 including
our strategic initiatives and operating plans
 the performance of our business and the market conditions for debt or equity financing.
Additionally
 the amount of capital required will depend on our ability to meet our case sales goals and otherwise successfully
execute our operating plan. We believe it is imperative to meet these sales objectives in order to lessen our reliance on external
financing in the future. Although we believe various debt and equity financing alternatives will be available to us to support
our working capital needs
 financing arrangements on acceptable terms may not be available to us when needed. Additionally
 these
alternatives may require significant cash payments for interest and other costs or could be highly dilutive to our existing shareholders.
Any such financing alternatives may not provide us with sufficient funds to meet our long-term capital requirements. If necessary
we may explore strategic transactions that we consider to be in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders
 which may
include
 without limitation
 public or private offerings of debt or equity securities
 and other strategic alternatives; however
these options may not ultimately be available or feasible.

A
worsening of economic conditions or a decrease in consumer spending may adversely impact our ability to implement our business
strategy.

Our
success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending
 which is influenced by general economic conditions
and the availability of discretionary income. There is no certainty regarding economic conditions in the United States
 and credit
and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions could deteriorate at any time. Accordingly
 we may experience declines
in revenue during economic turmoil or during periods of uncertainty. Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending
leading cost-conscious consumers to be more selective in restaurants visited
 could have a material adverse effect on our revenue
results of operations
 business and financial condition.

The
challenges of competing with the many food services businesses may result in reductions in our revenue and operating margins.

We
compete with many well-established companies
 food service and otherwise
 on the basis of taste
 quality and price of product
offered
 customer service
 atmosphere
 location and overall guest experience. Our success depends
 in part
 upon the popularity
of our products and our ability to develop new menu items that appeal to consumers across all four day parts. Shifts in consumer
preferences away from our products
 our inability to develop new menu items that appeal to consumers across all day parts
 or
changes in our menu that eliminate items popular with some consumers could harm our business. We compete with other smoothie and
juice bar retailers
 specialty coffee retailers
 yogurt and ice cream shops
 bagel shops
 fast-food restaurants
 delicatessens
caf&eacute;s
 take-out food service companies
 supermarkets and convenience stores. Our competitors change with each of the four
day parts
 ranging from coffee bars and bakery caf&eacute;s to casual dining chains. Many of our competitors or potential competitors
have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do
 which may allow them to react to changes in the market quicker
than we can. In addition
 aggressive pricing by our competitors or the entrance of new competitors into our markets
 could reduce
our revenue and operating margins. We also compete with other employers in our markets for workers and may become subject to higher
labor costs as a result of such competition.



    
    


The
recent global coronavirus outbreak could harm our business and results of operations.

In
March 2020 the World Health Organization declared coronavirus COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak
 which
has continued to spread
 and any related adverse public health developments
 has adversely affected workforces
 customers
 economies
and financial markets globally
 potentially leading to an economic downturn. It has also disrupted the normal operations of many
businesses
 including ours. This outbreak could decrease spending
 adversely affect demand for our product and harm our business
and results of operations. It is not possible for us to predict the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of the outbreak
and its effects on our business or results of operations at this time.

Disruption
within our supply chain
 contract manufacturing or distribution channels could have an adverse effect on our business
 financial
condition and results of operations.

Our
ability
 through our suppliers
 business partners
 contract manufacturers
 independent distributors and retailers
 to produce
transport
 distribute and sell products is critical to our success.

Damage
or disruption to our suppliers or to manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather
 natural disaster
 fire or explosion
terrorism
 pandemics such as COVD-19 and influenza
 labor strikes or other reasons
 could impair the manufacture
 distribution
and sale of our products. Many of these events are outside of our control. Failure to take adequate steps to protect against or
mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events
 or to effectively manage such events if they occur
 could adversely
affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.

In
addition
 our reliance on a limited number of manufacturers and suppliers could further increase this risk. Most of our suppliers
and manufacturers produce similar products for other companies
 and our products may represent a small portion of their businesses.
Further
 it takes a newly engaged manufacturer typically up to nine months of retrofitting/ preparation before it can begin producing
our products. We have contracts in place to produce sufficient units to meet projected demand; however
 if one of our manufactures
fails to perform
 we would be faced with a significant interruption in our supply chain. If one of our manufacturers or suppliers
fails to perform or deliver products
 for any reason
 our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore
if we are unable to meet our customers&rsquo; demands due to a disruption in our supply chain
 we may lose that customer which
could adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.&nbsp;

Our
dependence on independent contract manufacturers could make management of our manufacturing and distribution efforts inefficient
or unprofitable.

We
are expected to arrange for our contract manufacturing needs sufficiently in advance of anticipated requirements
 which is customary
in the contract manufacturing industry for comparably sized companies. Based on the cost structure and forecasted demand for the
particular geographic area where our contract manufacturers are located
 we continually evaluate which of our contract manufacturers
to use. To the extent demand for our products exceeds available inventory or the production capacity of our contract manufacturing
arrangements
 or orders are not submitted on a timely basis
 we will be unable to fulfill distributor orders on demand. Conversely
we may produce more product inventory than warranted by the actual demand for it
 resulting in higher storage costs and the potential
risk of inventory spoilage. Our failure to accurately predict and manage our contract manufacturing requirements and our inventory
levels may impair relationships with our independent distributors and key accounts
 which
 in turn
 would likely have a material
adverse effect on our ability to maintain effective relationships with those distributors and key accounts.

If
we do not adequately manage our inventory levels
 our operating results could be adversely affected.

We
need to maintain adequate inventory levels to be able to deliver products to distributors on a timely basis. Our inventory supply
depends on our ability to correctly estimate demand for our products. Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise
particularly for new products
 seasonal promotions and new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products or
are unable to maintain sufficient inventory of raw materials
 we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. If
we overestimate distributor or retailer demand for our products
 we may end up with too much inventory
 resulting in higher storage
costs
 increased trade spending and the risk of inventory spoilage. If we fail to manage our inventory to meet demand
 we could
damage our relationships with our distributors and retailers and could delay or lose sales opportunities
 which would unfavorably
impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. In addition
 if the inventory of our products held by our
distributors and retailers is too high
 they will not place orders for additional products
 which would also unfavorably impact
our sales and adversely affect our operating results.



    
    


Increases
in costs of packaging
 ingredients and contract manufacturing tolling fees may have an adverse impact on our gross margin.

Packaging
costs such as paper and aluminum cans have experienced industry wide price increases in the past and there is always the risk
that the company&rsquo;s co-packers increase their toll rates based on increases in their fixed and variable costs. If the Company
is unable to pass on these costs
 the gross margin will be significantly impacted.

Litigation
or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.

We
may become party to litigation claims and legal proceedings. Litigation involves significant risks
 uncertainties and costs
 including
distraction of management attention away from our business operations. We evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to
assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate
 if possible
 the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments
and estimates
 we establish reserves and disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings
 as appropriate. These assessments
and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management
judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from those envisioned by our current assessments and estimates. Our
policies and procedures require strict compliance by our employees and agents with all U.S. and local laws and regulations applicable
to our business operations
 including those prohibiting improper payments to government officials. Nonetheless
 our policies and
procedures may not ensure full compliance by our employees and agents with all applicable legal requirements. Improper conduct
by our employees or agents could damage our reputation or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or
criminal penalties
 including substantial monetary fines
 as well as disgorgement of profits.

We
have identified a material weakness in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. If
not remediated
 our failure to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and a failure to meet our reporting and financial
obligations
 each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common
stock.

Maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to produce
reliable financial statements. As discussed in Item 9A &ndash; &ldquo;Controls and Procedures&rdquo; of this Form 10-K
 we have
re-evaluated our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that they
were not effective as of December 31
 2019
 due to inadequate segregation of duties.

A
material weakness is defined as a deficiency
 or a combination of deficiencies
 in internal control over financial reporting such
that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness we identified is inadequate segregation of duties.

The
Company is committed to remediating its material weaknesses as promptly as possible. Implementation of the Company&rsquo;s remediation
plans has commenced and is being overseen by the audit committee. However
 there can be no assurance as to when these material
weaknesses will be remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future. Even effective internal control
can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. Any failure
to remediate the material weaknesses or the development of new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting

 which in turn could

to meet our financial reporting obligations.



    
    


Fluctuations
in various food and supply costs
 particularly fruit and dairy
 could adversely affect our operating results.

Supplies
and prices of the various ingredients that we are going to use to can be affected by a variety of factors
 such as weather
 seasonal
fluctuations
 demand
 politics and economics in the producing countries.

These
factors subject us to shortages or interruptions in product supplies
 which could adversely affect our revenue and profits. In
addition
 the prices of fruit and dairy
 which are the main ingredients in our products
 can be highly volatile. The fruit of
the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis
 depending on supply and demand at the time of the purchase. An increase
in pricing of any fruit that we are going to use in our products could have a significant adverse effect on our profitability.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to secure our fruit supply.

Our
business depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior management and other key personnel
 and our business may
be severely disrupted if we lose their services.

Our
future success heavily depends on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. If one or more of our
senior executives is unable or unwilling to continue to work for us in his present position
 we may have to spend a considerable
amount of time and resources searching
 recruiting
 and integrating a replacement into our operations
 which would substantially
divert management&rsquo;s attention from our business and severely disrupt our business. This may also adversely affect our ability
to execute our business strategy.

Our
senior management&rsquo;s limited experience managing a publicly traded company may divert management&rsquo;s attention from operations
and harm our business.

Our
senior management team has relatively limited experience managing a publicly traded company and complying with federal securities
laws
 including compliance with recently adopted disclosure requirements on a timely basis. Our management will be required to
design and implement appropriate programs and policies in responding to increased legal
 regulatory compliance and reporting requirements
and any failure to do so could lead to the imposition of fines and penalties and harm our business.

We
may be unable to attract and retain qualified
 experienced
 highly skilled personnel
 which could adversely affect the implementation
of our business plan.

Our
success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract
 retain and motivate skilled and qualified personnel. As we
become a more mature company in the future
 we may find recruiting and retention efforts more challenging. If we do not succeed
in attracting
 hiring and integrating excellent personnel
 or retaining and motivating existing personnel
 we may be unable to
grow effectively. The loss of any key employee
 including members of our senior management team
 and our inability to attract
highly skilled personnel with sufficient experience in our industries could harm our business.

Product
liability exposure may expose us to significant liability.

We
may face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability and other claims and lawsuits in the event that the development
or use of our technology or prospective products is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects. We may not be able to avoid significant
liability exposure. Although we believe our insurance coverage to be adequate
 we may not have sufficient insurance coverage
and we may not be able to obtain sufficient coverage at a reasonable cost. An inability to obtain product liability insurance
at acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization
of our products. A product liability claim could hurt our financial performance. Even if we ultimately avoid financial liability
for this type of exposure
 we may incur significant costs in defending ourselves that could hurt our financial performance and
condition.

Our
inability to protect our intellectual property rights may force us to incur unanticipated costs.

Our
success will depend
 in part
 on our ability to obtain and maintain protection in the United States and internationally for certain
intellectual property incorporated into our products. Our intellectual property rights may be challenged
 narrowed
 invalidated
or circumvented
 which could limit our ability to prevent competitors from marketing similar solutions that limit the effectiveness
of our patent protection and force us to incur unanticipated costs. In addition
 existing laws of some countries in which we may
provide services or solutions may offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights.



    
    


Our
products may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties
 and third parties may infringe our proprietary rights
either of which may result in lawsuits
 distraction of management and the impairment of our business.

As
the number of patents
 copyrights
 trademarks and other intellectual property rights in our industry increases
 products based
on our technology may increasingly become the subject of infringement claims. Third parties could assert infringement claims against
us in the future. Infringement claims with or without merit could be time consuming
 result in costly litigation
 cause product
shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Royalty or licensing agreements
 if required
 might
not be available on terms acceptable to us
 or at all. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement
of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Litigation to determine the validity of any
claims
 whether or not the litigation is resolved in our favor
 could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts
of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks. If there is an adverse ruling against us in any litigation
 we
may be required to pay substantial damages
 discontinue the use and sale of infringing products and expend significant resources
to develop non-infringing technology or obtain licenses to infringing technology. Our failure to develop or license a substitute
technology could prevent us from selling our products.

If
securities or industry analysts do not publish research
 or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research
 about our business
 our
share price and trading volume could decline.

The
trading market for our common stock may be impacted
 in part
 by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts
publish about our business or us. There can be no assurance that analysts will cover us
 continue to cover us or provide favorable
coverage. If one or more analysts downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock
 our share price may decline. In addition
if one or more analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us
 we could lose visibility in
the financial markets
 which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.

We
will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company
 and our management will be required to devote
substantial time to compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.

As
a public company
 we will continue to incur significant legal
 accounting and other expenses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various
requirements on public companies
 including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate
governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these
compliance initiatives. Moreover
 these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make
some activities more time-consuming and costly.

We
cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur to continue to operate as a public company
 nor can we
predict the timing of such costs. These rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations
 in many cases due
to their lack of specificity
 and
 as a result
 their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided
by regulatory and governing bodies which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs
necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.

Failure
to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.

As
a Delaware corporation
 we are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 which generally prohibits United States
companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining
business. Some foreign companies
 including some that may compete with our Company
 may not be subject to these prohibitions.
Corruption
 extortion
 bribery
 pay-offs
 theft and other fraudulent practices may occur from time-to-time in countries in which
we conduct our business. However
 our employees or other agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible.
If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices
 we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences
that may have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations.



    
    


It
is difficult to predict the timing and amount of our sales because our distributors and national accounts may not be required
to place minimum orders with us.

Our
distributors are not required to place minimum monthly or annual orders for our products. Accordingly
 we cannot predict the timing
or quantity of purchases by any of our independent distributors or whether any of our distributors will continue to purchase products
from us in the same frequencies and volumes as they may have done in the past. Additionally
 our larger distributors and partners
may make orders that are larger than we have historically been required to fill. Shortages in inventory levels
 supply of raw
materials or other key supplies could negatively affect us.

If
we do not adequately manage our inventory levels
 our operating results could be adversely affected.

We
need to maintain adequate inventory levels to be able to deliver products on a timely basis. Our inventory supply depends on our
ability to correctly estimate demand for our products. Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise
 particularly
for new products
 seasonal promotions and new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to
maintain sufficient inventory of raw materials
 we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. If we overestimate
retailer demand for our products
 we may end up with too much inventory
 resulting in higher storage costs
 increased trade spend
and the risk of obsolete inventory. If we fail to manage our inventory to meet demand
 we could damage our relationships with
our retailers and could delay or lose sales opportunities
 which would unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect
our operating results.

Risks
Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock

Our
common stock is quoted on the OTCQB
 which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.

Our
common stock is quoted on the OTCQB
 which is a significantly more limited trading market than the New York Stock Exchange
 or
the NASDAQ Stock Market. The quotation of the Company&rsquo;s shares on the OTCQB may result in a less liquid market available
for existing and potential shareholders to trade shares of our common stock
 could depress the trading price of our common stock
and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future.

There
is limited liquidity on the OTCQB
 which may result in stock price volatility and inaccurate quote information.

When
fewer shares of a security are being traded on the OTCQB
 price volatility may increase and price movement may outpace the ability
to deliver accurate quote information. Due to lower trading volumes in shares of our common stock
 there may be a lower likelihood
of one&rsquo;s orders for shares of our common stock being executed
 and current prices may differ significantly from the price
one was quoted at the time of one&rsquo;s order entry.

If
we are unable to adequately fund our operations
 we may be forced to voluntarily file for deregistration of our common stock with
the SEC.

Compliance
with the periodic reporting requirements required by the SEC consumes a considerable amount of both internal
 as well external
resources and represents a significant cost for us. If we are unable to continue to devote adequate funding and the resources
needed to maintain such compliance
 while continuing our operations
 we could be forced to deregister with the SEC. After the
deregistration process
 our common stock would only be tradable on the &ldquo;Pink Sheets&rdquo; and could suffer a decrease in
or absence of liquidity.



    
    


Because
we became public by means of a &ldquo;reverse merger&rdquo;
 we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms.

Additional
risks may exist since we became public through a &ldquo;reverse merger&rdquo;. Securities analysts of major brokerage firms may
not provide coverage of us since there is little incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. We
cannot assure you that brokerage firms will want to conduct any secondary offerings on behalf of our Company in the future.

Future
sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise funds
in future securities offerings.

Future
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market
 or the perception that such sales may occur
could adversely affect the then prevailing market price of our common stock and could make it more difficult for us to raise funds
in the future through a public offering of our securities.

Our
common stock is thinly traded
 so you may be unable to sell at or near asking prices or at all if you need to sell your shares
to raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares.

Currently
the Company&rsquo;s common stock is quoted in the OTCQB and future trading volume may be limited by the fact that many major institutional
investment funds
 including mutual funds
 as well as individual investors follow a policy of not investing in OTCQB stocks and
certain major brokerage firms restrict their brokers from recommending OTCQB stocks because they are considered speculative
 volatile
and thinly traded. The OTCQB market is an inter-dealer market much less regulated than the major exchanges and our common stock
is subject to abuses
 volatility and shorting. Thus
 there is currently no broadly followed and established trading market for
the Company&rsquo;s common stock. An established trading market may never develop or be maintained. Active trading markets generally
result in lower price volatility and more efficient execution of buy and sell orders. Absence of an active trading market reduces
the liquidity of the shares traded there.

The
trading volume of our common stock has been and may continue to be limited and sporadic. As a result of such trading activity
the quoted price for the Company&rsquo;s common stock on the OTCQB may not necessarily be a reliable indicator of its fair market
value. Further
 if we cease to be quoted
 holders would find it more difficult to dispose of our common stock or to obtain accurate
quotations as to the market value of the Company&rsquo;s common stock and as a result
 the market value of our common stock likely
would decline.

Our
common stock is subject to price volatility unrelated to our operations.

The
market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors
 including market perception of our
ability to achieve our planned growth
 quarterly operating results of other companies in the same industry
 trading volume in
our common stock
 changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting the Company&rsquo;s
competitors or the Company itself. In addition
 the OTCQB is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations in general. This
volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their
operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock.

We
are subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock.


OTCQB. Our common stock is subject to the requirements of Rule 15(g)-9
 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act as long
as the price of our common stock is below $5.00 per share. Under such rule
 broker-dealers who recommend low-priced securities
to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must satisfy special sales practice requirements
 including
a requirement that they make an individualized written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser&rsquo;s
consent prior to the transaction. The Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 also requires
additional disclosure in connection with any trades involving a stock defined as a penny stock. Generally
 the Commission defines
a penny stock as any equity security not traded on a national exchange that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share. The
required penny stock disclosures include the delivery
 prior to any transaction
 of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny
stock market and the risks associated with it. Such requirements could severely limit the market liquidity of the securities and
the ability of purchasers to sell their securities in the secondary market.



    
    


Because
we do not intend to pay dividends
 shareholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in
value.

We
have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our preferred stock or common stock. For the foreseeable future
 it is expected
that earnings
 if any
 generated from our operations will be used to finance the growth of our business
 and that no dividends
will be paid to holders of the Company&rsquo;s common stock. As a result
 the success of an investment in our common stock will
depend upon any future appreciation in its value. There can be no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value.

The
price of our common stock may become volatile
 which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.

The
trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate in response to factors such as:



    
    
actual
    or anticipated variations in our operating results;

    
    
    

    
    
announcements
    of developments by us or our competitors;

    
    
    

    
    
announcements
    by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions
 strategic partnerships
 joint ventures or capital commitments;

    
    
    

    
    
adoption
    of new accounting standards affecting our industry;

    
    
    

    
    
additions
    or departures of key personnel;

    
    
    

    
    
introduction
    of new products by us or our competitors;

    
    
    

    
    
sales
    of our common stock or other securities in the open market; and

    
    
    

    
    
other
    events or factors
 many of which are beyond our control.


The
stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations. In the past
 following periods of volatility in the market
price of a company&rsquo;s securities
 securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such a company. Litigation
initiated against us
 whether or not successful
 could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management&rsquo;s attention
and Company resources
 which could harm our business and financial condition.

Investors
may experience dilution of their ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock.

We
intend to continue to seek financing through the issuance of equity or convertible securities to fund our operations. In the future
we may also issue additional equity securities resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present shareholders.
We may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common
stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees
 future acquisitions or for other business purposes. The future issuance
of any such additional shares of common stock will result in dilution to our shareholders and may create downward pressure on
the trading price of our common stock.



    
    


Provisions
in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company
 which may be beneficial to
our stockholders
 more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.

Provisions
in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage
 delay or prevent a merger
 acquisition or other change in control
of our company that stockholders may consider favorable
 including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium
for your shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of
our common stock
 thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition
 because our board of directors is responsible
for appointing the members of our management team
 these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders
to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors.
In addition
 because we are incorporated in Delaware
 we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law
 which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining
with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding
voting stock
 unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.

7. Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The
information and financial data discussed below is derived from the audited financial statements of Barfresh for its fiscal year
ended December 31
 2019 and for the fiscal year ended December 31
 2018. The financial statements of Barfresh were prepared and
presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The information and financial data
discussed below is only a summary and should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and related notes
of Barfresh contained elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis may contain forward-looking statements based
on assumptions about our future business. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements as a result of certain factors. See &ldquo;Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements&rdquo; above for a
discussion of forward-looking statements and the significance of such statements in the context of this Annual Report.

Barfresh
is a leader in the creation
 manufacturing and distribution of ready to blend frozen beverages. The current portfolio of products
includes smoothies
 shakes and frappes. Products are packaged in two distinct formats.

The
Company&rsquo;s original single serve format features portion controlled and ready to blend beverage ingredient packs or &ldquo;beverage
packs&rdquo;. The beverage packs contain all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage
 including the base (either
sorbet
 frozen yogurt or ice cream)
 real fruit pieces
 juices and ice &ndash; five ounces of water are added before blending.

The
Company&rsquo;s bulk &ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo; format also contains all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage
packaged in gallon containers in a concentrated formula that is mixed &ldquo;one to one&rdquo; with water. The Company has a &ldquo;no
sugar added&rdquo; version of the bulk &ldquo;Easy Pour&rdquo; format that is specifically targeted for the USDA national school
meal program
 including the School Breakfast Program
 the National School Lunch Program
 and Smart Snacks in Schools Program.
The Company is currently in contract to sell its bulk Easy Pour products into over three hundred schools. In addition
 the Company
received approval from the United States Defense Logistics Agency (&ldquo;DLA&rdquo;) to sell its smoothie products into all branches
of the U.S. Armed Forces
 and is currently in contract to sell its bulk Easy Pour products into over one hundred military bases
in the United States and abroad.

Domestic
and international patents and patents pending are owned by Barfresh
 as well as related trademarks for all of the single serve
products. Patent rights have been granted in 13 jurisdictions including the United States. In addition
 the Company has purchased
all of the trademarks related to the patented products.

The
Company conducts sales through several channels
 including National Accounts
 Regional Accounts
 and Broadline Distributors. Barfresh&rsquo;s
primary broadline distribution arrangement is through an exclusive nationwide agreement with Sysco Corporation (&ldquo;Sysco&rdquo;)
the U.S.&rsquo;s largest broadline distributor
 which was entered into during July 2014. Pursuant to that agreement
 all Barfresh
products are included in Sysco&rsquo;s national core selection of beverage items
 making Barfresh its exclusive single-serve
pre-portioned beverage provider. The agreement is mutually exclusive; however
 Barfresh may also sell the products to other foodservice
distributors
 but only to the extent required for such foodservice distributors to service multi-unit chain operators with at
least 20 units and where Sysco is not such multi- unit chain operator&rsquo;s nominated distributor for our products. On October
2
 2019
 the exclusive distribution agreement with Sysco expired
 opening the possibility to expand distribution with other distributors
outside of the Sysco system.

During
2016 and 2017 the Company announced that it had signed supply agreements with several of the major global on-site foodservice
operators. On March 8
 2018
 the Company announced that it had signed a new supply agreement with one of the largest of these
foodservice operators
 for exclusive distribution of four Barfresh single serve skus. On November 14
 2018
 the Company
announced that it had received approval for multiple products to be rolled out to a national restaurant chain with over 2
500
locations.

On
October 26
 2015
 Barfresh signed a five-year agreement with PepsiCo North America Beverages
 a division of PepsiCo
 to become
its exclusive sales representative within the food service channel to present the Barfresh line of ready-to-blend smoothies and
frozen beverages throughout the United States and Canada. Through this agreement
 Barfresh&rsquo; products are included as part
of PepsiCo&rsquo;s offerings to its significant customer base. The agreement facilitates access to potential National customer
accounts
 through introductions provided by PepsiCo&rsquo;s one thousand plus person foodservice sales team. Barfresh products
have become part of PepsiCo&rsquo;s customer presentations at national trade shows and similar venues.

Barfresh
utilizes contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the products in the United States. Production lines are currently operational
at two locations. The first location is in Salt Lake City
 which currently produces both bulk easy pour and single serve products.
Annual production capacity with this contract manufacturer is 14 million units per year. The second location is with Yarnell Operations
LLC.
 a subsidiary of Schulze &amp; Burch
 located in Arkansas. The Yarnell&rsquo;s agreement
 which was signed during February
2016
 and secures the capacity to ramp up to an incremental production capacity of 100 million units. Yarnell&rsquo;s location
enhances the company&rsquo;s ability to efficiently move product throughout the supply chain to destinations in the eastern United
States
 home to many of the country&rsquo;s large foodservice outlets.



    
    


During
November 2016
 the Company received an equity investment from Unibel
 the majority shareholder of the Bel Group (&ldquo;Unibel&rdquo;).
The Bel Group is headquartered in Paris
 France
 with global operations in 33 countries
 30 production sites on 4 continents and
nearly 12
000 employees. Its many branded products
 including The Laughing Cow&reg;
 Mini Babybel&reg; and Boursin&reg;
 are sold
in over 130 countries around the world. Pursuant to the securities purchase agreement
 Unibel purchased 15
625
000 shares of common
stock at $0.64 per share (&ldquo;Shares&rdquo;) and warrants to purchase 7
812
500 shares of common stock (&ldquo;Warrants&rdquo;)
for aggregate gross proceeds to Barfresh of $10 million. The Warrants are exercisable for a term of five years at a per share
price of $.88 for cash. Pursuant to the Investor Rights agreement
 Barfresh has registered the Shares and the Warrants
 and Unibel
was granted a seat on the Barfresh Board. This strategic investment provided Barfresh with necessary capital while leveraging
Unibel&rsquo;s more than 150 years of industrial expertise
 innovative capabilities
 world-class marketing and branding expertise
to accelerate our growth in new and existing markets and product channels.

On
February 14
 2018
 the Company announced the private placement of convertible notes with gross proceeds of $4.1 million The closing
of the first 60% of this amount occurred between March 12 and 22
 2018
 after notice was issued by the Company that it had entered
into a material agreement or series of related agreements with a national account for the sale of its products into approximately
1
000 new locations. The remaining 40% of the principal amount was to be received upon achieving a second milestone
 which is
entering into a material agreement or series of related agreements with a national account for the sale of its products into approximately
2
500 new locations. During November of 2018 the Company and several of the Convertible Note investors agreed to amend the definition
of Milestone 2 to allow for the funding the remaining 40% of the principal amount upon the Company receiving approval from a National
Restaurant Chain with over 2
500 for the rollout of its products. Such approval was received during the fourth quarter of 2018
and the Company received an additional $1.4 million of convertible note proceeds.

The
convertible notes are unsecured and have (i) a two-year term
 (ii) a 10% annual coupon to be paid in cash or stock at the Company&rsquo;s
discretion at a conversion price equal to 85% of the average closing bid prices of the Common Stock over the twenty (20) consecutive
trading day period immediately preceding the payment date
 but in no event lower than sixty cents ($0.60) per share of Common
Stock. The investor&rsquo;s may elect to convert their principal into common stock at a conversion price equal to the lower of:
(i) $0.88 per share of Common Stock
 or (ii) 85% of the average closing bid prices of the Common Stock over the twenty (20) consecutive
trading day period immediately preceding the date of investor&rsquo;s election to convert; but in no event lower than $0.60 per
share of Common Stock. Investors also received warrant coverage of 25% of the number of shares that would be issuable upon a full
conversion of the principal amount at an average of the twenty consecutive trading day period immediately preceding the applicable
closing date. If any principal amount remains outstanding after the one-year anniversary of the closing
 investors will be granted
an additional warrant with identical terms. The warrants are exercisable for a period of three years for cash at the greater of
120% of the closing price or $0.70 per share of common stock. After the initial private placement
 investors were offered the
opportunity to accelerate the issuance of the additional warrant by increasing their convertible note investment by 10% to 20%.
After the close of the first quarter 2018
 a number of investors took advantage of this acceleration opportunity
 resulting in
an increase in the amount of the total convertible note by $177
300 and the issuance of 930
332 additional warrants. During the
fourth quarter 2018
 four of the convertible note investors elected to convert their notes into stock
 with a total of $453
000
of convertible debt
 plus accrued interest being converted into stock.

During
the fourth quarter of 2018
 one investor exercised 833
333 N warrants for cash
 at $0.45 per share. $221
918 of the proceeds of
that transaction were used to pay down a short term note payable
 held by the same investor
 in the amount of $200
000
 plus accrued
interest. The balance of the proceeds of the N warrant exercise
 in the amount of $153
082 were received by the Company.

During
the first quarter of 2019
 the Company completed additional funding
 including a Private Placement Offering for common
shares priced at $0.60 per share
 resulting in the receipt of capital investment in the amount of $2.4 million and the issuance
of 4
000
000 shares. In addition
 during the first quarter of 2019 the Company offered to reduce the exercise price on its I Warrants
from $1 to $0.60
 for a limited time. During the time this offer was open
 I Warrant holders converted 2
841
454 warrants at $0.60
resulting in the receipt of capital investment in the amount of $1.7 million. In addition
 during the first quarter of 2019
 one
investor exercised G series warrants
 resulting in the receipt of capital investment in the amount of $180
000
 and the issuance
of 300
000 shares. In total
 during the first quarter of 2019 the Company raised $4.3 million and issued 7
141
454 shares
 and
no additional warrants were issued.

On
March 23
 2020
 the Company completed additional funding
 including a Private Placement Offering for common shares priced at $0.50
per share (subject to adjustment) resulting in the receipt of proceeds in the amount of $3.825 million and the issuance
of 7
650
000 shares. The investors of this Private Placement Offering will be granted O warrants to be eligible to purchase an
additional 0.50 shares for every share issued to each purchaser
 exercisable for a period of 3 years at an exercise price of $0.60
per share (subject to adjustment). If the volume-weighted average trading price for the 20 consecutive trading
days that conclude upon 6 months after the initial closing (the &ldquo;Six Month Price&rdquo;) exceeds or equals $0.50 per share
(the &ldquo;Target Price&rdquo;)
 the per share purchase price will not be adjusted. If the Six Month Price is less than the Target
Price
 the per share purchase price will be automatically reduced to the Six Month Price
 but in no event less than $0.35 per
share
 in which case the Company shall issue to each investor
 pro-rata based on such investor&rsquo;s investment: (a) shares
in a quantity that equals the difference between the number of shares issued to such purchaser at closing and the number of shares
that would have been issued to such purchaser at closing at the Six Month Price; and (b) a warrant for a number of shares of common
stock equal to 50% of the difference between the number of shares issued to such investor at closing and the number of shares
that would have been issued to such investor at closing at the Six Month Price
 with an exercise price equal to the sum of $0.10
per share and the Six Month Price
 but in no eventless than $0.45 per share. The exercise price per share for each warrant will
automatically adjust to the sum of $0.10 per share and the Six-Month Price
 but in no event less than $0.45 per share.

In addition
 the Company obtained a 24 month extension on $1
071
000
in principal
 and conversion of $720
000 of principal of the Milestone I Convertible Notes at a conversion price of $0.50 per
share. The remaining $110
166 was extended for thirty days. The interest rate on the principal balance of the extended Milestone
I Convertible Notes was amended to 15%. Furthermore
 the Company obtained a 12 month extension on $168
000 in principal
 and conversion
of $1
128
000 in principal of the Milestone II Convertible Notes. The remaining $67
200 was extended for thirty days. The Convertible
Noteholders of the Milestone I and II Convertible Notes were granted additional interest depending upon their election to convert
or extend their Convertible Notes.

Critical
Accounting Policies

Our
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;).

Revenue
Recognition

In
accordance with ASC 606
 &ldquo;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&rdquo;
 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains ownership
of promised goods. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to
receive in exchange for these goods. The Company applies the following five steps:



    
    
Identify
    the contract with a customer

    
    
    

    
    
A
    contract with a customer exists when (i) the Company enters into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each
    party&rsquo;s rights
 (ii) the contract has commercial substance and
 (iii) the Company determines that collection of substantially
    all consideration for goods or services that are transferred is probable. For the Company
 the contract is the approved sales
    order
 which may also be supplemented by other agreements that formalize various terms and conditions with customers.

    
    
    

    
    
Identify
    the performance obligation in the contract

    
    
    

    
    
Performance
    obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or that will be transferred to the customer. For the
    Company
 this consists of the delivery of frozen beverages
 which provide immediate benefit to the customer.

    
    
    

    
    
Determine
    the transaction price

    
    
    

    
    
The
    transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring
    goods and is generally stated on the approved sales order. Variable consideration
 which typically includes volume-based rebates
    or discounts
 are estimated utilizing the most likely amount method.

    
    
    

    
    
Allocate
                                         the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract 
        
Since
        our contracts contain a single performance obligation
 delivery of frozen beverages
 the transaction price is allocated
        to that single performance obligation.

    
    
    

    
    
Recognize
    Revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation

    
    
    

    
    
The
    Company recognizes revenue from the sale of frozen beverages when title and risk of loss passes and the customer accepts the
    goods
 which generally occurs at the time of delivery to a customer warehouse. Customer sales incentives such as volume-based
    rebates or discounts are treated as a reduction of sales at the time the sale is recognized. Shipping and handling costs are
    treated as fulfillment costs and presented in distribution
 selling and administrative costs.

    
    
    

    
    
The
    company evaluated the requirement to disaggregate revenue and concluded that substantially all of its revenue comes from a
    single product
 frozen beverages.


Share-based
Compensation

We
account for share-based employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance
with applicable accounting standards
 which require all share-based payments to employees
 including grants of stock options and
restricted stock units (RSUs)
 to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards
 with the resulting expense generally
recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the
award.



    
    


Convertible
Notes

We
issue debt that may have separate warrants
 conversion features
 or no equity-linked attributes. When we issue debt with warrants
we determine the value of the warrants using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model (&ldquo;Black-Scholes&rdquo;) using the stock
price on the date of issuance
 the risk free interest rate associated with the life of the debt
 and the estimated volatility
of our stock. When we issue debt with a conversion feature
 we must first assess whether the conversion feature meets the requirements
to be treated as a derivative. If the conversion feature within convertible debt meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative
we estimate the fair value of the convertible debt derivative using Black-Scholes upon the date of issuance
 using the stock price
on the date of issuance
 the risk free interest rate associated with the life of the debt
 and the estimated volatility of our
stock. If the conversion feature is not treated as a derivative
 we assess whether it is a beneficial conversion feature (&ldquo;BCF&rsquo;).
A BCF exists if the conversion price of the convertible debt instrument is less than the stock price on the commitment date. This
typically occurs when the conversion price is less than the fair value of the stock on the date the instrument was issued. The
value of a BCF is equal to the intrinsic value of the feature
 the difference between the conversion price and the common stock
into which it is convertible.

Derivative
Liability

The
Company evaluates its convertible instruments
 options
 warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded
components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under ASC Topic 815
 &ldquo;Derivatives and
Hedging.&rdquo; The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of any derivative is marked-to-market each balance
sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability
 the change in fair value
is recorded in the statement of operations as gain/loss from derivative liability. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative
instrument
 the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity.
We analyzed the derivative financial instruments in accordance with ASC 815. The objective is to provide guidance for determining
whether an equity-linked financial instrument is indexed to an entity&rsquo;s own stock. This determination is needed for a scope
exception which would enable a derivative instrument to be accounted for under the accrual method. The classification of a non-derivative
instrument that falls within the scope of ASC 815-40-05 &ldquo;Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to
 and
Potentially Settled in
 a Company&rsquo;s Own Stock&rdquo; also hinges on whether the instrument is indexed to an entity&rsquo;s
own stock. A non-derivative instrument that is not indexed to an entity&rsquo;s own stock cannot be classified as equity and must
be accounted for as a liability. There is a two-step approach in determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed
to an entity&rsquo;s own stock. First
 the instrument&rsquo;s contingent exercise provisions
 if any
 must be evaluated
 followed
by an evaluation of the instrument&rsquo;s settlement provisions. The Company utilized the fair value standard set forth by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board
 defined as the amount at which the assets (or liability) could be bought (or incurred) or
sold (or settled) in a current transaction between willing parties
 that is
 other than in a forced or liquidation sale.

Results
of Operations

Revenue
and cost of revenue

Revenue
increased $71
626
 or 2%
 from $4
235
159 in 2018 to $4
306
785 in 2019. Our products continue to be distributed through all 72
of Sysco&rsquo;s U.S. mainland distribution centers
 as well as through new customers beyond the Sysco distribution network.

Cost
of revenue for 2019 was $1
928
210 as compared to $2
033
396 in 2018. Our gross profit was $2
313
209 (54%) and $2
144
664 (51%)
for 2019 and 2018
 respectively. This improvement was driven by a number of factors
 including leverage due to larger scale of
production and product mix. We anticipate that our gross profit percentage for 2020 will be comparable to that of 2019. Depreciation
from manufacturing equipment was $65
366 and $57
099 for December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.



    
    


Operating
expenses

Our
operations were primarily directed towards increasing sales and expanding our distribution network.

Our
general and administrative expenses decreased $962
859 (12%) from $7
813
425 in 2018 to $6
850
566 in 2019
 with the improvement
driven by lower personnel expenses resulting from reduced headcount
 reduced stock-based compensation expense from terminated
employees
 and reduced marketing and selling expense from a renegotiated distribution agreement. The following is a breakdown
of our general and administrative expenses for the years 2019 and 2018.

Personnel
cost represents the cost of employees including salaries
 bonuses
 employee benefits and employment taxes for the years 2019 and
2018 and continues to be our largest cost. Personnel cost decreased $189
863 (6%) from $3
027
548 to $2
837
685. At year end 2018
we had 26 full time employees
 and we currently have 17 full time employees.

Stock
based compensation is used as an incentive to attract new employees and to compensate existing employees. Stock based compensation
includes stock issued and options granted to employees. Stock compensation for the current year was $225
026
 a decrease of $273
742
or 55%
 from the year ago expense of $498
768. The decrease is primarily due to reductions in our workforce and the timing of
equity grants. The Company issues additional stock options to its employees from time to time under its Equity Compensation Plan.

Legal
and professional fees decreased 34%
 or $158
836
 from $463
991 in 2018 to $305
155 in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to
reduced legal services required. We anticipate legal fees related to our business and financing activities to decrease as we have
renegotiated arrangements with existing service providers.

Travel
expenses decreased $73
685 (17%) from $432
140 in 2018 to $358
455 in 2019. The decrease is primarily due to reduced travel associated
with terminated employees. We anticipate that travel expenses for 2020 will be comparable to the current year.

Rent
expense is primarily for our location in Los Angeles
 California. Rent expense for the Los Angeles office is approximately $6
500
per month. During 2018 we leased office space at 8383 Wilshire Boulevard
 Beverly Hills
 California pursuant to a lease that commenced
on November 1
 2016 and expired March 31
 2019
 with monthly rent expense of $14
488. Effective April 1
 2019
 we have entered
into a new lease for office space located at 3600 Wilshire Boulevard Suite 1720
 Los Angeles
 90010.



    
    


Marketing
and selling expenses decreased $181
952 (24%) from $750
059 in 2018 to $568
107 in 2019. Lower marketing and selling expenses
were primarily due to lower percentage commission associated with a renegotiated distribution agreement.

Consulting
fees increased $58
612 (97%)
 from $60
359 in 2018
 to $118
971 in 2019. The increase was due primarily to services related to
consulting to improve sales operations. Our consulting fees vary based on needs. We engaged consultants in the areas of sales
operations during the both 2019 and 2018. The need for future consulting services will be variable.

Director
fees increased $4
386
 or 2%
 from $241
000 in 2018 to $245
386 in 2019 due to director and officer insurance premiums.
Annual director fees are anticipated at $50
000 per non-employee director.

Research
and development expenses decreased $135
833
 (20%) from $674
224 in 2018 to $538
391 in 2019 due to reduced product development
activity with national accounts and fewer market tests. These expenses relate to the services performed by our Director of Manufacturing
and Product Development
 and consultants supporting that employee. These activities are primarily directed towards to development
of new products.

Shipping
and storage expense decreased $113
634 (13%) from $864
871 in 2018 to $751
237 in 2019. Shipping and storage expense as a percentage
of revenue decreased from 20% in 2018 to 17% in 2019. This improvement is primarily due to the growth of the scale of our business
and the corresponding cost savings associated with freight movement. We anticipate that shipping and storage expense as a percentage
of sales will continue to reduce in the future
 as the Company continues to take advantage of more efficient distribution arrangements.

Other
expenses consist of ordinary operating expenses such as investor relations
 office
 telephone
 insurance
 and stock related costs.
Other expense increased $210
180
 from $599
364 in 2018 to $809
544 in 2019
 driven mainly by equipment repair
 recruiting
and insurance expense.

We
had operating losses of $5
187
204 in 2019 and $6
180
080 in 2018. The improvement of $992
876 or 16%
 was primarily due to higher
gross profit margin
 and lower G&amp;A expenses.

Interest
expense for 2019 is $1
213
263 relates to &ldquo;Milestone 1&rdquo; convertible debt in the amount of $2
704
800 that was issued
on March 14
 2018
 which bears interest at 10%
 &ldquo;Milestone 2&rdquo; convertible debt in the amount of $1
363
200 that was
issued on November 30
 2018
 which bears interest at 10%. Of the Milestone 1 convertible debt
 $453
000 of principal
 and the
accrued interest thereon
 was converted into stock during the fourth quarter of 2018. The principal and accrued interest on the
Note Payable in the amount of $250
000 was repaid during the fourth quarter of 2018. Interest expense for 2019 includes amortization
of $881
871 of the value of warrants issued with the Milestone 1 and Milestone 2 convertible debt.

The
change in fair value of the derivative liability resulted in a gain of $1
114
625 for the year ended December 31
 2019. The gain
was driven by the decrease in the stock price of the Company.

The
warrant modification was revalued at February 22
 2019 with a value of $849
505. The difference in fair value immediately before
and after the modification of the warrant resulted in a loss of $307
460.

We
had net losses of $5
593
302 and $7
322
823 for the years 2019 and 2018
 respectively. This reduction in net loss
 in the amount
of $1
729
521
 or 24%
 is primarily attributable to the same factors that drove the improvement in operating losses
 partially
offset by certain non-cash charges
 including higher interest
 warrant modification
 and gain from derivative liability
 in 2019.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

As
of December 31
 2019
 we had a working capital surplus of $146
337 as compared with a working capital surplus of $652
360 at December
31
 2018. The reduction in working capital surplus is primarily due to the reduction in inventory and an increase in accrued interest
partially offset by a reduction in accrued liabilities.



    
    


During
the twelve-month period ended December 31
 2019
 we used cash of $3
353
326 in operations
 $466
216 for the purchase of equipment
and $5
324 for patents and trademarks. The Company received $1
500
357 in cash for warrant exercises
 $2
400
000 in cash for issuance
of stock and paid $25
686 in operating leases.

Our
liquidity needs will depend on how quickly we are able to profitably ramp up sales
 as well as our ability to control and reduce
variable operating expenses
 and to continue to control and reduce fixed overhead expense.

On
February 14
 2018
 the Company announced the private placement of convertible notes with gross proceeds of $4.1 million The closing
of the first 60% of this amount occurred between March 12 and 22
 2018
 after notice was issued by the Company that it had entered
into a material agreement or series of related agreements with a national account for the sale of its products into approximately
1
000 new locations. The remaining 40% of the principal amount was to be received upon achieving a second milestone
 which is
entering into a material agreement or series of related agreements with a national account for the sale of its products into approximately
2
500 new locations. During November of 2018 the Company and several of the Convertible Note investors agreed to amend the definition
of Milestone 2 to allow for the funding the remaining 40% of the principal amount upon the Company receiving approval from a National
Restaurant Chain with over 2
500 for the rollout of its products. Such approval was received during the fourth quarter of 2018
and the Company received an additional $1.4 million of convertible note proceeds.

The
convertible notes are unsecured and have (i) a two-year term
 (ii) a 10% annual coupon to be paid in cash or stock at the Company&rsquo;s
discretion at a conversion price equal to 85% of the average closing bid prices of the Common Stock over the twenty (20) consecutive
trading day period immediately preceding the payment date
 but in no event lower than sixty cents ($0.60) per share of Common
Stock. The investor&rsquo;s may elect to convert their principal into common stock at a conversion price equal to the lower of:
(i) $0.88 per share of Common Stock
 or (ii) 85% of the average closing bid prices of the Common Stock over the twenty (20) consecutive
trading day period immediately preceding the date of investor&rsquo;s election to convert; but in no event lower than $0.60 per
share of Common Stock. Investors also received warrant coverage of 25% of the number of shares that would be issuable upon a full
conversion of the principal amount at an average of the twenty consecutive trading day period immediately preceding the applicable
closing date. If any principal amount remains outstanding after the one-year anniversary of the closing
 investors will be granted
an additional warrant with identical terms. The warrants are exercisable for a period of three years for cash at the greater of
120% of the closing price or $0.70 per share of common stock. After the initial private placement
 investors were offered the
opportunity to accelerate the issuance of the additional warrant by increasing their convertible note investment by 10% to 20%.
After the close of the first quarter of 2018
 a number of investors took advantage of this acceleration opportunity
 resulting
in an increase in the amount of the total convertible note by $177
300 and the issuance of 930
332 additional warrants. During
the fourth quarter of 2018
 four of the convertible note investors elected to convert their notes into stock
 with a total of
$453
000 of convertible debt
 plus accrued interest being converted into stock.

During
the fourth quarter of 2018
 one investor exercised 833
333 N warrants for cash
 at $0.45 per share. $221
918 of the proceeds of
that transaction were used to pay down a short term note payable
 held by the same investor
 in the amount of $200
000
 plus accrued
interest. The balance of the proceeds of the N warrant exercise
 in the amount of $153
082 were received by the Company.

During
the first quarter of 2019
 the Company completed additional funding including a Private Placement Offering for common
shares priced at $0.60 per share
 resulting in the receipt of capital investment in the amount of $2.4 million and the issuance
of 4
000
000 shares. In addition
 during the first quarter of 2019 the Company offered to reduce the exercise price on its I Warrants
from $1 to $0.60
 for a limited time. During the time this offer was open
 I Warrant holders converted 2
841
454 warrants at $0.60
resulting in the receipt of capital investment in the amount of $1.7 million. In addition
 during the first quarter of 2019
 one
investor exercised G series warrants
 resulting in the receipt of capital investment in the amount of $180
000
 and the issuance
of 300
000 shares. In total
 during the first quarter of 2019 the Company has raised $4.3 million and issued 7
141
454 shares
and no additional warrants.

On
March 23
 2020
 the Company completed additional funding
 including a Private Placement Offering for common shares priced at $0.50
per share (subject to adjustment)
 resulting in the receipt of proceeds in the amount of $3.825 million and the issuance
of 7
650
000 shares. The investors of this Private Placement Offering will be granted O warrants to be eligible to purchase an
additional 0.50 shares for every share issued to each purchaser
 exercisable for a period of 3 years at an exercise price of $0.60
per share (subject to adjustment) but in no event less than $0.45 per share. If the volume-weighted average trading
price for the 20 consecutive trading days that conclude upon 6 months after the initial closing (the &ldquo;Six Month Price&rdquo;)
exceeds or equals $0.50 per share (the &ldquo;Target Price&rdquo;)
 the per share purchase price will not be adjusted. If the
Six Month Price is less than the Target Price
 the per share purchase price will be automatically reduced to the Six Month Price
but in no event less than $0.35 per share
 in which case the Company shall issue to each investor
 pro-rata based on such investor&rsquo;s
investment: (a) shares in a quantity that equals the difference between the number of shares issued to such purchaser at closing
and the number of shares that would have been issued to such purchaser at closing at the Six Month Price; and (b) a warrant for
a number of shares of common stock equal to 50% of the difference between the number of shares issued to such investor at closing
and the number of shares that would have been issued to such investor at closing at the Six Month Price
 with an exercise price
equal to the sum of $0.10 per share and the Six Month Price
 but in no eventless than $0.45 per share. The exercise price per
share for each warrant will automatically adjust to the sum of $0.10 per share and the Six-Month Price
 but in no event less than
$0.45 per share. In addition
 the Company obtained a 24 month extension on $1
071
000 in principal
 and conversion of $720
000
of principal of the Milestone I Convertible Notes at a conversion price of $0.50 per share. The remaining $110
166 was extended
for thirty days. The interest rate on the principal balance of the extended Milestone I Convertible Notes was amended to 15%.
Furthermore
 the Company obtained a 12 month extension on $168
000 in principal
 and conversion of $1
128
000 in principal of
the Milestone II Convertible Notes. The remaining $67
200 was extended for thirty days. The Convertible Noteholders of the Milestone
I and II Convertible Notes were granted additional interest depending upon their election to convert or extend their Convertible
Notes.

The
impact of COVID-19 on the Company is evolving rapidly with events unfolding on a daily and weekly basis. The direct impact to
our operations has begun to take affect at the close of the first quarter ended March 31
 2020. Specifically
 our business has
been impacted by dining bans targeted at restaurants to reduce the size of public gatherings. We have noted restaurant chains
have closed operations and furloughed employees which would preclude our single serve products from being served at those establishments
for a number of weeks. Furthermore
 many school districts have closed regular attendance which could conceivably last to the end
of the school year. This will directly impact the sales of our Bulk Product into that sales channel. Our headquarters are located
in Los Angeles
 California
 where the entire state has been issued a &ldquo;shelter in place&rdquo; order from the Governor of
California. Consequently
 our staff in the headquarter office are working remotely until further notice. At this point
 we have
not experienced a disruption in the supply chain for manufacturing our products. The developments surrounding COVID-19 remain
fluid and dynamic
 and consequently
 will require the Company to continue to monitor news headlines from government and health
officials
 as well as
 the business community.

Our
operations to date have been financed by the sale of securities
 the issuance of convertible debt and the issuance of short-term
debt
 including related party advances. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations with the capital raised
we will be required to raise additional funds either in the form of equity or in the form of debt. There are no assurances
that we will be able to generate the necessary capital to carry out our current plan of operations.



    
    


We
have entered into a direct lease for new premises covering the period April 1
 2019 to March 31
 2023. The aggregate minimum requirements
under the non-cancellable direct lease as of December 31
 2019 is $254
368.

Management&rsquo;s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President Finance
we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as such term is defined under Securities and Exchange Act
of 1934 Rules 13a-15(f). Based on this evaluation
 our Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President Finance concluded that the
Company&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31
 2019
 due to inadequate segregation
of duties.

Management&rsquo;s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
 as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act
 for the Company.

Internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that
in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles
 and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management
and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use
or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2019.
The framework used by management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled &ldquo;Internal
Control &ndash; Integrated Framework&rdquo; issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)
in 2013.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President Finance
we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as such term is defined under Securities and Exchange Act
of 1934 Rules 13a-15(f). Based on this evaluation
 our Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President Finance concluded that the
Company&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31
 2019.



    
    


Management
has identified the following material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting:

Inadequate
Segregation of Duties: We have an inadequate number of personnel to properly implement internal controls over financial reporting.

Since
the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting did identify material weaknesses
 management
considers its internal control over financial reporting to be ineffective.

Management
recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control
 and accordingly
 even effective
internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or
detect material misstatements. In addition
 effective internal control at a point in time may become ineffective in future periods
because of changes in conditions or due to deterioration in the degree of compliance with our established policies and procedures.

In
an effort to remediate the identified material weakness and enhance our internal control over financial reporting
 we plan to
engage additional financial personnel to help ensure that we are able to properly implement internal control procedures.

This
report shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act
 or otherwise subject to the liabilities
of that section
 and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company
 whether made before or after the date hereof
regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

During
the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31
 2019
 there was a significant reduction in headcount
 specifically in the areas
of finance
 operations and administration. The decrease in staffing gave rise to a material weakness over our internal control
over financial reporting. The Company will evaluate the staffing necessary to reinstate the documentation standards sufficient
to ensure proper implementation of internal control procedures over the coming quarters.

judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. We determined
 as of December 31
 2018
 that five of our seven directors
are independent
 which constitutes a majority. One of our directors
 Alice Elliot
 resigned effective April 1
 2019
 reducing
the current number of directors to six
 four of which are independent.

Committees

We
currently have an audit committee
 a compensation committee and a nominating and governance committee. The members of the
audit committee are Arnold Tinter
 Steven Lang
 and Alexander Ware. The audit committee is primarily responsible for
reviewing the services performed by our independent auditors and evaluating our accounting policies and our system of
internal controls. Steven Lang
 Arnold Tinter
 and Alex Ware are independent members of the audit committee
 as defined
above. The members of the
compensation committee are Arnold Tinter
 Joe Cugine
 and Riccardo Delle Coste. The compensation committee is primarily
responsible for reviewing and approving our salary and benefits policies (including stock options) and other compensation of
our executive officers. The members of the nominating committee are Arnold Tinter
 Steven Lang
 and Isabelle Ortiz-Cachet.
The nominating and governance committee is primarily responsible for overseeing corporate governance and for identifying

the best of our knowledge
 none of our executive officers or directors are parties to any material proceedings adverse to the
Company
 have any material interest adverse to the Company or have been subject to legal
 administrative or judicial orders
 proceedings
or decrees required to be disclosed.

Code

13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
 and Director Independence.

Certain
Relationships and Related Transactions

The
following includes a summary of transactions since the beginning of fiscal 2019 or any currently proposed transaction
 in which
we were or are to be a participant and the amount involved exceeded or exceeds the lesser of $120
000 or one percent of the average
of our total assets at year-end for the last two completed fiscal years and in which any related person had or will have a direct
or indirect material interest (other than compensation described under &ldquo;Executive Compensation&rdquo;). We believe the terms
obtained or consideration that we paid or received
 as applicable
 in connection with the transactions described below were comparable
to or better than terms available or the amounts that would be paid or received
 as applicable
 in arm&rsquo;s-length transactions.

The
Company&rsquo;s policy with regard to related party transactions requires any related party loans that are (i) non-interest bearing
and in excess of $100
000 or (ii) interest bearing
 irrespective of amount
 must be approved by the Company&rsquo;s board of directors.
All issuances of securities by the Company must be approved by the board of directors
 irrespective of whether the recipient is
a related party. Each of the foregoing transactions
 if required by its terms
 was approved in this manner.

Director
Independence

We
use the definition of &ldquo;independence&rdquo; standards as defined in the NASDAQ Stock Market Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that
an &ldquo;independent director&rdquo; is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual having
a relationship
 which
 in the opinion of the Company&rsquo;s board of directors
 would interfere with the exercise of independent
judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. We have determined as of December 31
 2019 that four of our six directors
are independent
 which constitutes a majority.

Audit
Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures

Under
the SEC&rsquo;s rules
 an audit committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent
registered public accounting firm in order to ensure that they do not impair the auditors&rsquo; independence. The SEC&rsquo;s
rules specify the types of non-audit services that an independent auditor may not provide to its audit client and establish the
audit committee&rsquo;s responsibility for administration of the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm.
The Company has established an Audit Committee. Accordingly

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Barfresh Food Group
 Inc.

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Barfresh Food Group
 Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of December
31
 2019 and 2018
 and the related consolidated statements of 
stockholders&rsquo; equity (deficit)
 and cash flows for the years then ended
 and the related notes (collectively referred to
as the &ldquo;financial statements&rdquo;). In our opinion
 the consolidated financial statements present fairly
 in all material
respects
 the financial position of Barfresh Food Group
 Inc. as of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for the years then ended
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

Basis
for Opinion

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) and are required to be independent with respect to Barfresh
Food Group
 Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether
due to error or fraud. Barfresh Food Group Inc. is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity&rsquo;s internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion.

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risk of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements
 whether
due to error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Note
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Barfresh
Food Group Inc.
 (&ldquo;we
&rdquo; &ldquo;us
&rdquo; &ldquo;our
&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) was incorporated on February
25
 2010 in the State of Delaware. We are engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of ready to blend beverages
 particularly
smoothies
 shakes and frappes.

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;).

Basis
of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and our wholly owned subsidiaries
 Barfresh
Inc. and Barfresh Corporation Inc. (formerly known as Smoothie
 Inc.). All inter-company balances and transactions among the companies
have been eliminated upon consolidation.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the years reported. Actual
results may differ from these estimates.

Concentration
of Credit Risk

The
amount of cash on deposit with financial institutions exceeds the $250
000 federally insured limit at December 31
 2019 and 2018.
However
 we believe that cash on deposit that exceeds $250
000 in the financial institutions is financially sound and the risk
of loss is minimal.

Restricted
Cash

In
the third quarter of 2019
 the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-18
 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (&ldquo;ASU
2016-18&rdquo;)
 which enhances and clarifies the guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement
of cash flows and requires additional disclosures about restricted cash balances. At December 31
 2019
 the Company had $91
385
in restricted cash related to our co-packing agreement with Yarnell Operations
 LLC.

Fair
Value Measurement

Financial
Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) Topic 820

Measurements and Disclosures
 provides a comprehensive framework for measuring fair value and expands
disclosures which are required about fair value measurements. Specifically
 ASC 820 sets forth a definition of fair value and
establishes a hierarchy prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques
 giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets and liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable value inputs. ASC 820 defines the hierarchy
as follows:

Level
1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. The types of assets
and liabilities included in Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices
 such as equities listed
on the New York Stock Exchange.

Level
2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets but are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported
date. The types of assets and liabilities in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or contracts
or priced with models using highly observable inputs.

Level
3 - Significant inputs to pricing that are unobservable as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included
in Level 3 are those with inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation
 such as complex and subjective models
and forecasts used to determine the fair value of financial transmission rights.

Our
financial instruments consist of cash
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable
 accrued expenses
 derivative liabilities
 and convertible
notes. The carrying value of our financial instruments approximates their fair value
 except for the derivative liability in which
carrying value is fair value.

Accounts
Receivable

Accounts
receivable are typically unsecured. Our credit policy calls for payment generally within 30 days. The credit worthiness of a customer
is evaluated prior to a sale. As of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the company&rsquo;s allowance for doubtful accounts was $141
788
and $61
788 respectively. There was $89
397 of bad debt expense recorded for the year ended December 31
 2019 and $61
788 of bad
debt expense for the year ended December 31
 2018. The allowance was applied to certain receivable accounts which are over 95
days.


    
    




Inventory
consists of finished goods and is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first in first out basis. The company
monitors the remaining useful life of its inventory and establishes a reserve of obsolescence where appropriate. As of December
31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company&rsquo;s inventory reserve was $100
651 and $31
237 respectively.

Intangible
Assets

Intangible
assets are comprised of patents
 net of amortization and trademarks. The patent costs are being amortized over the life of the
patent

- Goodwill and Other
 the costs of internally developing other intangible assets
 such as patents
are expensed as incurred. However
 as allowed by ASC 350
 costs associated with the acquisition of patents from third parties
legal fees and similar costs relating to patents have been capitalized.

In
accordance with ASC 350 legal costs related to trademarks have been capitalized. We have determined that trademarks have an indeterminable
life and therefore are not being amortized.

Long-Lived
Assets and Other Acquired Intangible Assets

We
evaluate the recoverability of property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events
or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest
level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability
of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected
to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable
the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any impairment charges during the years presented.

Property
Plant
 and Equipment

Property
plant
 and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss
 if any. Depreciation is
calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are being amortized
over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term that includes any expected renewal periods that are deemed
to be reasonably assured. The estimated useful lives used for financial statement purposes are:



Furniture
    and fixtures: 
5
    years

Manufacturing
    equipment and customer equipment: 
3
    years to 7 years

Leasehold
    improvements: 
2
    years

    
5
    years


Revenue
Recognition

In
accordance with ASC 606
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains ownership of promised
goods. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange
for these goods. The Company applies the following five steps:



    
    
Identify
    the contract with a customer

    
    
A
    contract with a customer exists when (i) the Company enters into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each
    party&rsquo;s rights
 (ii) the contract has commercial substance and
 (iii) the Company determines that collection of substantially
    all consideration for goods or services that are transferred is probable. For the Company
 the contract is the approved sales
    order
 which may also be supplemented by other agreements that formalize various terms and conditions with customers.

    
    
    

    
    
Identify
    the performance obligation in the contract

    
    
Performance
    obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer.
    For the Company
 this consists of the delivery of frozen beverages
 which provide immediate benefit to the customer.



    
    




    
    
Determine
    the transaction price

    
    
The
    transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring
    goods and is generally stated on the approved sales order. Variable consideration
 which typically includes volume-based rebates
    or discounts
 are estimated utilizing the most likely amount method.

    
    
    

    
    
Allocate
                                         the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract 
Since
        our contracts contain a single performance obligation
 delivery of frozen beverages
 the transaction price is allocated
        to that single performance obligation.

    
    
    

    
    
Recognize
    Revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation

    
    
The
    Company recognizes revenue from the sale of frozen beverages when title and risk of loss passes and the customer accepts the
    goods
 which generally occurs at the time of delivery to a customer warehouse. Customer sales incentives such as volume-based
    rebates or discounts are treated as a reduction of sales at the time the sale is recognized. Shipping and handling costs are
    treated as fulfillment costs and presented in distribution
 selling and administrative costs.

    
    
    

    
    
The
    company evaluated the requirement to disaggregate revenue and concluded that substantially all of its revenue comes from a
    single product
 frozen beverages.


Research
and Development

Expenditures
for research activities relating to product development and improvement are charged to expense as incurred. We incurred $538
391
and $674
224
 in research and development expenses for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.

Shipping
and Storage Costs

Shipping
and handling costs are included in general and administrative expenses. For the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 shipping
and handling costs totaled $751
237 and $864
871
 respectively.

Rent
Expense

As
of January 1
 2019
 the Company adopted ASC 842. ASC 842 replaced the prior lease accounting guidance in its entirety. As disclosed
in Note 7
 we entered into a new office space lease that took effect on April 1
 2019 and recorded a right-of-use asset and corresponding
liability for amounts that approximate our future commitments of $241
555. Lease expense for finance leases consists of the amortization
of the ROU asset on a straight-line basis over the asset&rsquo;s estimated useful life and is included in operating expenses in
the consolidated statement of income.

Income
Taxes

The
provision for income taxes is determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740
 
(&ldquo;ASC 740&rdquo;). Under this method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

ASC
740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize
 measure
 present
 and disclose in their financial statements
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740
 tax positions must initially be recognized
in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50%
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant
facts.

ASC
740 requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight of evidence
 it is more
than likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized.

For
the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018 we did not have any interest and penalties or any significant unrecognized uncertain
tax positions.


    
    


Derivative
Liability

The
Company evaluates its convertible instruments
 options
 warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded
components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under ASC Topic 815
 &ldquo;Derivatives and
Hedging.&rdquo; The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of any derivative is marked-to-market each balance
sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability
 the change in fair value
is recorded in the statement of operations as gain/loss from derivative liability. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative
instrument
 the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity.
We analyzed the derivative financial instruments in accordance with ASC 815. The objective is to provide guidance for determining
whether an equity-linked financial instrument is indexed to an entity&rsquo;s own stock. This determination is needed for a scope
exception which would enable a derivative instrument to be accounted for under the accrual method. The classification of a non-derivative
instrument that falls within the scope of ASC 815-40-05 &ldquo;Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to
 and
Potentially Settled in
 a Company&rsquo;s Own Stock&rdquo; also hinges on whether the instrument is indexed to an entity&rsquo;s
own stock. A non-derivative instrument that is not indexed to an entity&rsquo;s own stock cannot be classified as equity and must
be accounted for as a liability. There is a two-step approach in determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed
to an entity&rsquo;s own stock. First
 the instrument&rsquo;s contingent exercise provisions
 if any
 must be evaluated
 followed
by an evaluation of the instrument&rsquo;s settlement provisions. The Company utilized the fair value standard set forth by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board
 defined as the amount at which the assets (or liability) could be bought (or incurred) or
sold (or settled) in a current transaction between willing parties
 that is
 other than in a forced or liquidation sale.

Earnings
per Share

We
calculate net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260
. Basic net loss per share is computed
by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period
 and diluted earnings
per share is computed by including common stock equivalents outstanding for the period in the denominator. At December 31
 2019
and 2018 any equivalents would have been anti-dilutive as we had losses for the periods then ended.

Stock
Based Compensation

We
calculate stock compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718
 (&ldquo;ASC 718&rdquo;).
ASC 718 requires that the cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and
establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires all entities
to apply a fair-value-based measurement method in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees except for equity
instruments held by employee stock ownership plans

Recent
pronouncements

From
time to time
 new accounting pronouncements are issued that we adopt as of the specified effective date. We believe that the impact
of recently issued standards that are not yet effective may have an impact on our results of operations and financial position.

In
February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 &ldquo;Leases&rdquo;
 to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions.
This ASU will require organizations that lease assets (&ldquo;lessees&rdquo;) to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use
asset on its balance sheet for all leases with terms of more than twelve months. A lease liability is a lessee&rsquo;s obligation
to make lease payments arising from a lease
 measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset represents the lessee&rsquo;s
right to use
 or control use of
 a specified asset for the lease term. The amendments in this ASU leaves the accounting for the
organization that own the assets leased to the lessee (&ldquo;lessor&rdquo;) largely unchanged except for targeted improvements
to align it with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606
 &ldquo;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&rdquo;.

The
Company has evaluated the effect of the standard on our financial statements. Based on our evaluation
 we have one material lease
subject to adoption of this standard
 effective January 1
 2019. As disclosed in Note 8
 we entered into a new office space lease
that took effect on April 1
 2019 and recorded a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability for amounts that approximate our
future commitments of $241
555.

Note
4. Intangible Assets

As
of December 31
 2019
 intangible assets consist of patent costs of $764

 2018
 intangible assets consist of patent costs of $764
891
 trademarks of $103
309 and accumulated amortization
of $330
411.

The
amounts carried on the balance sheet represent cost to acquire
 legal fees and similar costs relating to the patents incurred
by the Company. Amortization is calculated through the expiration date of the patent
 which is December 2025. The amount charged
to expenses for amortization of the patent costs was $63
610 and $63
610 for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018

6. Convertible Notes (Related and Unrelated Party)

In
March 2018
 we closed an offering of $2
527
500 in convertible notes
 Series CN Note 1 of 2
 of which
 management
 directors and
significant shareholders have invested $840
000. The convertible notes bear 10% interest per annum and are due and payable on
March 14
 2020. The notes are convertible at any time prior to the due date into our common stock at conversion price of $0.88
per share or 85% of the average closing price of the common stock over the twenty consecutive trading days immediately preceding
the date of note holders&rsquo; election; but in no event lower than $0.60 per share. In addition
 the interest is convertible
at any time prior to the due dates into our common stock at conversion price of 85% of the average closing price of the common
stock over the twenty consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of note holders&rsquo; election; but in no event
lower than $0.60 per share. There were 1
331
583 warrants issued
 in conjunction with the convertible note offering.

The
fair value of the warrants
 $0.17 per share ($220
548 in the aggregate)
 was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model using the following assumptions:




    
    

    
    

    
    

    
    


The
value of $220
548 was recorded as a debt discount related to the issuance of the warrants.

In
April 2018
 we offered investors in our March 2018 Convertible Note (&ldquo;Series CN Notes&rdquo;) the opportunity to accelerate
the issuance of certain warrants associated with the CN Notes. Pursuant to the acceleration offer
 Series CN Notes investors who
invested an additional 10% to 20% of the Series CN Note amount
 immediately received an additional 25% warrant coverage on their
initial CN Note investment
 which would otherwise have been issued after one year. During April 2018
 we closed the CN Note acceleration
offer in the amount of $177
300 in convertible notes
 of which
 management
 directors and significant shareholders have invested
$30
000. The CN Note acceleration offer convertible notes bear 10% interest per annum and are due and payable on March 14
 2020.
The notes are convertible at any time prior to the due date into our common stock at conversion price of $0.88 per share or 85%
of the average closing price of the common stock over the twenty consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of note
holders&rsquo; election; but in no event lower than $0.60 per share. In addition
 the interest is convertible at any time prior
to the due dates into our common stock at conversion price of 85% of the average closing price of the common stock over the twenty
consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of note holders&rsquo; election; but in no event lower than $0.60 per
share. There were 937
373 warrants issued in conjunction with the Series CN Note acceleration offer convertible note offering.

The
fair value of the warrants
 $0.25 per share ($235
519 in the aggregate)
 was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model using the following assumptions:



    
    

    
    

    
    

    
    


The
value of $105
199 was recorded as a debt discount related to the issuance of the warrants as using the fair value would cause
the debt discount to exceed the gross proceeds received.

In
November and December 2018
 three investors elected to convert their convertible note issued on March 14
 2018 into stock. The
total debt converted was $453
000 and $30
459 accrued interest into 804
396 shares of stock.

In
March 2019
 an investor elected to exercise I-Warrants by using part of the investor&rsquo;s convertible note. The total debt
settled was $350
634 of principal and $33
929 of accrued interest.

The
convertible notes consist of the following components as of the year-end:

 we closed an offering of $1
363
200 in convertible notes
 Series CN 2 of 2
 of which
 management
 directors and
significant shareholders have invested $560
000. The convertible notes bear 10% interest per annum and are due and payable on
November 30
 2020. The notes are convertible at any time prior to the due date into our common stock at conversion price of $0.88
per share or 85% of the average closing price of the common stock over the twenty consecutive trading days immediately preceding

Note
7. Derivative Liabilities

As
discussed in Note 6
 Convertible Notes
 the Company issued Series CN Note acceleration offer convertible notes payable that provide
variable conversion provisions. The conversion terms of the convertible notes are variable based on certain factors
 such as the
future price of the Company&rsquo;s common stock. The number of shares of common stock to be issued is based on the future price
of the Company&rsquo;s common stock
 therefore the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the promissory
note is indeterminate.

The
fair values of the Company&rsquo;s derivative liabilities are estimated at the issuance date and are revalued at each subsequent
reporting date. The Company recognized a derivative liability and debt discount of $569
588 at March 14
 2018 related to the Series
CN Convertible notes 1 of 2; $69
400 at April 11
 2018 related to the Series CN Notes Warrant Acceleration; and $697
186 at November
30
 2018 related to the Series CN Convertible note 2 of 2. The derivative liability was revalued at December 31
 2019 and 2018
with a value of $211
028 and $1
325
653. The Company recorded a net gain of $1
114
625 and a net loss of $87
630 for the years
ended December 31
 2019 and 2018 respectively related to the derivative liability. The 2018 net loss consists of a $110
829 gain
for a portion of the derivative liability being settled upon a noteholders decision to convert their outstanding principal to
equity under the terms of the convertible note agreement
 and a loss of $198
459 from the change in fair value.

The
fair value of the derivative liability for CN Convertible Note 1 of 2 and CN Note Warrant Acceleration was calculated using the
Black-Scholes model using the following assumptions.



    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    


The
fair value of the derivative liability for CN Convertible Note 2 of 2 was calculated using the Black-Scholes model using the following
assumptions.

8. Commitments and Contingencies

We
lease office space under non-cancelable operating lease which expires on March 31
 2023. We incurred lease expense of $92
608
and $167
530 for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively. As of December 31
 2019
 our right of use asset and
related liability was $203
287 and $215
689
 respectively.

In
determining the present value of our operating lease right-of-use asset and liability
 we used a 10% discount rate (which approximates
our borrowing rate). The remaining term on the lease is 3.25 years.

ASC
740 requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight of evidence
 it is more
than likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized. After consideration of all the
evidence
 both positive and negative
 management has determined that a $10
395
000 and $7
969
000 allowance at December 31
 2019
and 2018
 respectively
 is necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.
The increase in the valuation allowance for the current period is $2
426
000.

As
of December 31
 2019
 we have a net operating loss carry forward of approximately $37
259

future taxable income. If not used
 this carry forward will expire as follows:

13. Liquidity

We
have a history of operating losses and negative cash flow. As our operations grow
 we expect to experience significant increases
in our working capital requirements. These conditions raise substantial doubt over the Company&rsquo;s ability to meet all of
its obligations over the twelve months following the filing of this Form 10-K. Management has evaluated these conditions
 and
concluded that current plans will alleviate this concern. As of December 31
 2019
 we had $1
091
374 of cash on the balance sheet.
We have continued to significantly reduce core operating expenses
 reducing total General and Administrative Expense in 2019 by
$962
859
 or 12%
 as compared with 2018. In addition
 in the first quarter of 2020
 the Company completed $3.825 million of funding.
These financings included a Private Placement Offering for common shares priced at $0.50 cents per share. Moreover
 on
March 23
 2020 the Company obtained extensions or conversion of its Milestone I and II Convertible Notes as described in Note
14.

Management
has concluded that these actions have alleviated the substantial doubt of our ability to continue as a going concern. However
the Company cannot predict
 with certainty
 the outcome of its action to generate liquidity
 including the availability of additional
financing
 or whether such actions would generate the expected liquidity as planned.

Note
14. Subsequent Events

On
March 23
 2020
 the Company completed additional funding including a Private Placement Offering for common shares priced at $0.50
per share (subject to adjustment)
 resulting in the receipt of proceeds in the amount of $3.825 million and the issuance
of 7
650
000 shares. The investors of this Private Placement Offering will be granted O warrants to be eligible to purchase an
additional 0.50 shares for every share issued to each purchaser
 exercisable for a period of 3 years at an exercise price of $0.60
per share
 (subject to adjustment). If the volume-weighted average trading price for the 20 consecutive trading days
that conclude upon 6 months after the initial closing (the &ldquo;Six Month Price&rdquo;) exceeds or equals $0.50 per share (the
&ldquo;Target Price&rdquo;)
 the per share purchase price will not be adjusted. If the Six Month Price is less than the Target
Price
 the per share purchase price will be automatically reduced to the Six Month Price
 but in no event less than $0.35 per
share
 in which case the Company shall issue to each investor
 pro-rata based on such investor&rsquo;s investment: (a) shares
in a quantity that equals the difference between the number of shares issued to such purchaser at closing and the number of shares
that would have been issued to such purchaser at closing at the Six Month Price; and (b) a warrant for a number of shares of common
stock equal to 50% of the difference between the number of shares issued to such investor at closing and the number of shares
that would have been issued to such investor at closing at the Six Month Price
 with an exercise price equal to the sum of $0.10
per share and the Six Month Price
 but in no eventless than $0.45 per share. The exercise price per share for each warrant will
automatically adjust to the sum of $0.10 per share and the Six-Month Price
 but in no event less than $0.45 per share. In
addition
 the Company obtained a 24 month extension on $1
071
000 in principal
 and conversion of $720
000 of principal of the
Milestone I Convertible Notes at a conversion price of $0.50 per share. The remaining $110
166 was extended for thirty days. The
interest rate on the principal balance of the extended Milestone I Convertible Notes was amended to 15%. Furthermore
 the Company
obtained a 12 month extension on $168
000 in principal
 and conversion of $1
128
000 in principal of the Milestone II Convertible
Notes. The remaining $67
200 was extended for thirty days. The Convertible Noteholders of the Milestone I and II Convertible Notes
were granted additional interest depending upon their election to convert or extend their Convertible Notes.

The
impact of COVID-19 on the Company is evolving rapidly with events unfolding on a daily and weekly basis. The direct impact to
our operations has begun to take affect at the close of the first quarter ended March 31
 2020. Specifically
 our business has
been impacted by dining bans targeted at restaurants to reduce the size of public gatherings. We have noted restaurant chains
have closed operations and furloughed employees which would preclude our single serve products from being served at those establishments
for a number of weeks. Furthermore
 many school districts have closed regular attendance which could conceivably last to the end
of the school year. This will directly impact the sales of our Bulk Product into that sales channel. Our headquarters are located
in Los Angeles
 California
 where the entire state has been issued a &ldquo;shelter in place&rdquo; order from the Governor of
California. Consequently
 our staff in the headquarter office are working remotely until further notice. At this point
 we have
not experienced a disruption in the supply chain for manufacturing our products. The developments surrounding COVID-19 remain
fluid and dynamic
 and consequently
 will require the Company to continue to monitor news headlines from government and health
officials
 as well as
 the business community.

DESCRIPTION
OF THE REGISTRANT&rsquo;S SECURITIES
REGISTERED
PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE
SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

As
of December 31
 2019
 Barfresh Food Group
 Inc.&rsquo;s (&ldquo;Barfresh
&rdquo; the &ldquo;Company
&rdquo; &ldquo;we
&rdquo;
&ldquo;our
&rdquo; &ldquo;us&rdquo;) common stock
 par value $0.000001 per share (&ldquo;Common Stock&rdquo;) was registered under
Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;) and quoted on OTCQB under the
symbol &ldquo;BRFH&rdquo;.

The
following is a summary of the material terms of our common stock. This summary does not purport to be exhaustive and is qualified
in its entirety by reference to our certificate of incorporation
 as amended (&ldquo;Certificate&rdquo;) and our amended and restated
bylaws (&ldquo;Bylaws&rdquo;) and to the applicable provisions of Delaware law.

Authorized
Common Stock

Our
authorized shares of common stock consists of 295
000
000 shares of common stock
 par value $0.000001 per share. As of December
31
 2019
 130
341
737 shares of our common stock were outstanding.

Common
Stock

Each
share of our common stock entitles its holder to one vote in the election of each director and on all other matters voted on generally
by our shareholders
 other than any matter that (i) solely relates to the terms of any outstanding series of preferred stock or
the number of shares of that series and (ii) does not affect the number of authorized shares of preferred stock or the powers
privileges and rights pertaining to the common stock. No share of our common stock affords any cumulative voting rights. This
means that the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares voting for the election of directors can elect all directors
to be elected if they choose to do so. Holders of our common stock will be entitled to dividends in such amounts and at such times
as our board of directors in its discretion may declare out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends. We currently
intend to retain our entire available discretionary cash flow to finance the growth
 development and expansion of our business
and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future dividends will be paid
at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors
 including:



    
    
general
    business conditions;

    
    
    

    
    
industry
    practice;

    
    
    

    
    
our
    financial condition and performance;

    
    
    

    
    
our
    future prospects;

    
    
    

    
    
our
    cash needs and capital investment plans;

    
    
    

    
    
our
    obligations to holders of any preferred stock we may issue;

    
    
    

    
    
income
    tax consequences; and

    
    
    

    
    
the
    restrictions Delaware and other applicable laws and our credit arrangements then impose.


If
we liquidate or dissolve our business
 the holders of our common stock will share ratably in all our assets that are available
for distribution to our shareholders after our creditors are paid in full and the holders of all series of our outstanding preferred
stock
 if any
 receive their liquidation preferences in full.

Our
common stock has no preemptive rights and is not convertible or redeemable or entitled to the benefits of any sinking or repurchase
fund.



    
    


Anti-Takeover
Effects of Certain Provisions of Delaware Law and Our Certificate and Bylaws

We
are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the &ldquo;DGCL&rdquo;)
 an anti-takeover
law. Subject to certain exceptions
 the statute prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a &ldquo;business
combination&rdquo; with an &ldquo;interested stockholder&rdquo; for a period of three years after the date of the transaction
in which the person became an interested stockholder unless:



    
    
prior
    to such date
 the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction which
    resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;

    
    
    

    
    
upon
    consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder
 the interested stockholder
    owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced
 excluding for
    purposes of determining the number of shares outstanding those shares owned (1) by persons who are directors and also officers
    and (2) by employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares
    held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or

    
    
    

    
    
on
    or after such date
 the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special
    meeting of stockholders
 and not by written consent
 by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting
    stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.


For
purposes of Section 203
 a &ldquo;business combination&rdquo; includes a merger
 asset sale or other transaction resulting in
a financial benefit to the interested stockholder
 and an &ldquo;interested stockholder&rdquo; is a person who
 together with
affiliates and associates
 owns
 or within three years prior to the date of determination whether the person is an &ldquo;Interested
Stockholder&rdquo; did own
 15% or more of the corporation&rsquo;s voting stock.

In
addition
 our authorized but unissued shares of common stock are available for our board to issue without stockholder approval.
We may use these additional shares for a variety of corporate purposes
 including future public or private offerings to raise
additional capital
 corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of our authorized but unissued shares of
common stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of our company by means of a proxy contest
tender offer
 merger or other transaction. Our authorized but unissued shares may be used to delay
 defer or prevent a tender
offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in its best interest
 including those attempts that might result in
a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders.

The
Company&rsquo;s directors and executive officers are indemnified as provided by the Delaware General Corporation Law and the Company&rsquo;s
Certificate. These provisions state that the Company&rsquo;s directors may cause the Company to indemnify a director or former
director against all costs
 charges and expenses
 including an amount paid to settle an action or satisfy a judgment
 actually
and reasonably incurred by him as a result of him acting as a director. The indemnification of costs can include an amount paid
to settle an action or satisfy a judgment. Such indemnification is at the discretion of the Company&rsquo;s board of directors
and is subject to the SEC&rsquo;s policy regarding indemnification.

Insofar
as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors
 officers or persons controlling
the Company pursuant to the foregoing provisions
 or otherwise
 the Company has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC
 such
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is
 therefore
 unenforceable.

In
the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment of expenses incurred or paid by a
director
 officer or controlling person in a successful defense of any action
 suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director
officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered
 we will
 unless in the opinion of its counsel
the matter has been settled by controlling precedent
 submit to the court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication
of such issue.

of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
 it being acknowledged by the Holder that the Company

is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. To the extent that the limitation contained

this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation
herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations
contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this Warrant. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall
not apply to any holder of greater than 5% of the Common Stock of the Company prior to the Initial Exercise Date. The Beneficial

holder of record of such shares for all purposes
 as of the date the Warrant has been exercised by payment to the Company of the
Exercise Price and all taxes required to be paid by the Holder
 if any
 pursuant to Section 2(d)(v) prior to the issuance of such
Warrant Shares
 have been paid. The Warrant Shares shall bear a restrictive legend substantially similar to the restrictive legend
placed on the Common Shares issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.

 the Company shall
 at the request
of a Holder and upon surrender of this Warrant certificate

 then the Holder will have
the right to rescind such exercise.

of this Warrant. As to any fraction of a share which Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such exercise

 (ii) combines
(including by way of reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares
 or (iv) issues by
reclassification of shares of the Common Stock any shares of capital stock of the Company
 then
 in each case
 the Exercise Price
shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares
if any) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately after such event and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted
such that the aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant shall remain unchanged. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 3(a)
shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend
or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision
 combination or re-classification.

c)

 if any) issued and outstanding.

d)
. The Company may at any time during the term of this Warrant reduce the then current Exercise
Price to any amount and for any period of time deemed appropriate by the board of directors of the Company provided that any such
reduction is made in identical manner to all then unexercised Warrants held by Holders.

e)
. Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this
Section 3
 the Company shall promptly mail to the Holder a notice setting forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and setting
forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment.

Section

of the assignee or assignees and in the denomination or denominations specified in such instrument of assignment
 and shall issue
to the assignor a new Warrant evidencing the portion of this Warrant not so assigned

to the Holder
 and for all other purposes
 absent actual notice to the contrary.

d)
. If
 at the time of the surrender of this Warrant in connection with any transfer of this Warrant
the transfer of this Warrant shall not be registered pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act
and under applicable state securities or blue sky laws

the Holder or transferee of this Warrant
 as the case may be

 such information regarding
the distribution of such holder&rsquo;s registrable securities as is required by law to be disclosed.

d)

 Sundays
 Holidays
 etc
required or granted herein shall not be a Business Day
 then such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next
succeeding Business Day.

e)
. The Company covenants that during the period the Warrant is outstanding
 it will reserve from its authorized
and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares to provide for the issuance of the Warrant Shares upon the exercise of
any purchase rights under this Warrant. The Company further covenants that its issuance of this Warrant shall constitute full
authority to its officers who are charged with the duty of executing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates
for the Warrant Shares upon the exercise of the purchase rights under this Warrant. The Company will take all such reasonable
action as may be necessary to assure that such Warrant Shares may be issued as provided herein without violation of any applicable
law or regulation
 or of any requirements of the Trading Market upon which the Common Stock may be listed. The Company covenants
that all Warrant Shares which may be issued upon the exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant will
 upon exercise
of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant
 be duly authorized
 validly issued
 fully paid and nonassessable and free
from all taxes
 liens and charges created by the Company in respect of the issue thereof (other than taxes in respect of any transfer
occurring contemporaneously with such issue).

Except
and to the extent as waived or consented to by the Holder
 the Company shall not by any action
 including
 without limitation
amending its certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization
 transfer of assets
 consolidation
 merger
 dissolution
issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action
 avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the
terms of this Warrant
 but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all
such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of Holder as set forth in this Warrant against impairment.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
 the Company will (a) not increase the par value of any Warrant Shares above
the amount payable therefor upon such exercise immediately prior to such increase in par value
 (b) take all such action as may

Stock on a Trading Market. The Company will take all action reasonably necessary to continue the listing or quotation and trading
of its Common Stock on a Trading Market and will comply in all respects with the Company&rsquo;s reporting
 filing and other obligations
under the bylaws or rules of the Trading Market.


    
    


4.10
. Each Purchaser severally and not jointly with the other Purchasers
covenants that neither it nor any Affiliate acting on its behalf or pursuant to any understanding with it will execute any Short
Sales during the period commencing at the Discussion Time and ending at the time that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are first publicly announced as described in Section 4.4. Each Purchaser
 severally and not jointly with the other Purchasers
covenants that until such time as the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are publicly disclosed by the Company as described
in Section 4.4
 such Purchaser will maintain the confidentiality of the existence and terms of this transaction and the information
included in the Disclosure Schedules. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 no Purchaser makes any representation
 warranty or covenant
hereby that it will not engage in Short Sales in the securities of the Company after the time that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are first publicly announced as described in Section 4.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 in the case of a Purchaser
that is a multi-managed investment vehicle whereby separate portfolio managers manage separate portions of such Purchaser&rsquo;s
assets and the portfolio managers have no knowledge of the investment decisions made by the portfolio managers managing other
portions of such Purchaser&rsquo;s assets
 the covenant set forth above shall only apply with respect to the portion of assets
managed by the portfolio manager that made the investment decision to purchase the Securities covered by this Agreement.

4.11
. The Company shall deliver
 or cause to be delivered
 the respective Securities purchased
by each Purchaser to such Purchaser within five (5) Trading Days of the Closing Date.

4.12
. The Company agrees to file in a timely manner a Form D with respect to the Securities as required
under Regulation D and to provide a copy thereof
 promptly upon request of any Purchaser. The Company shall take such action as
the Company shall reasonably determine is necessary in order to obtain an exemption for
 or to qualify the Securities for
 sale
to the Purchasers at the Closing under applicable securities or &ldquo;Blue Sky&rdquo; laws of the states of the United States
and shall provide evidence of such actions promptly upon request of any Purchaser.

4.13
. The Per Share Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment in accordance
with this Section 4.13. Provided that if the volume-weighted average trading price for the last twenty (20) consecutive trading
&rdquo;) exceeds or equals
&rdquo;)
 the Per Share Purchase Price will not be adjusted. If the Six Month Price
is less than the Target Price
 the Per Share Purchase Price will be automatically reduced to the Six Month Price
 but in no event
less than $0.35 per Share
 in which case the Company shall issue to each Purchaser
 based on such Purchaser&rsquo;s investment:
(a) shares in a quantity that equals the difference between the number of Shares issued to such Purchaser at closing and the number
of Shares that would have been issued to such Purchaser at closing at the Six Month Price; and (b) a Warrant for a number of Warrant
Shares equal to fifty percent (50%) of the difference between the number of Shares issued to such Purchaser at closing and the
number of Shares that would have been issued to such Purchaser at closing at the Six Month Price
 with an exercise price equal
to the sum of $0.10 per Share and the Six Month Price
 but in no event less than $0.45 per Share. The exercise price per share
for the Warrant issued at Closing will automatically adjust to the sum of $0.10 per share and the Six Month Price
 but in no event
less than $0.45 per Share.

By
way of example
 if a Purchaser invests an aggregate of $1
000
000 and the Six Month Price exceeds or equals the Target Price
the Purchaser will have received an aggregate of 2
000
000 Shares and a Warrant for 1
000
000 Warrant Shares at an exercise price
of $0.60 per Share. If the Six Month Price is $0.40
 Purchaser will have received an aggregate of 2
500
000 Shares and a Warrant
for 1
250
000 Warrant Shares at an exercise price of $0.50 per share.

or
 in the case of a waiver
 by the party against whom enforcement of any such waived provision is sought. No waiver of any default
with respect to any provision
 condition or requirement of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a continuing waiver in the future
or a waiver of any subsequent default or a waiver of any other provision
 condition or requirement hereof
 nor shall any delay
or omission of any party to exercise any right hereunder in any manner impair the exercise of any such right.

5.5

5.8
iaries. This Agreement is intended for the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns and is not for the benefit of

5.9
. All questions concerning the construction
 validity
 enforcement and interpretation of the Transaction Documents

 without regard
to the principles of conflicts of law thereof. Each party agrees that all legal proceedings concerning the interpretations
 enforcement
and defense of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other Transaction Documents (whether brought against a
party hereto or its respective affiliates
 directors
 officers
 shareholders
 employees or agents) shall be commenced exclusively
in the state and federal courts sitting in Los Angeles

of the state and federal courts sitting in the Los Angeles

herewith or with any transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein (including with respect to the enforcement of any of
the Transaction Documents)
 and hereby irrevocably waives
 and agrees not to assert in any suit
 action or proceeding
 any claim
that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court
 that such suit
 action or proceeding is improper or is
an inconvenient venue for such proceeding. Each party hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to process
being served in any such suit
 action or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof via registered or certified mail or overnight delivery
(with evidence of delivery) to such party at the address in effect for notices to it under this Agreement and agrees that such

5.10
. The representations and warranties contained herein shall survive the Closing and the delivery of the Shares
and Warrant Shares.

5.11
. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts
 all of which when taken together shall be considered
one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to the other
party
 it being understood that both parties need not sign the same counterpart. In the event that any signature is delivered
by facsimile transmission or by e-mail delivery of a &ldquo;.pdf&rdquo; format data file
 such signature shall create a valid
and binding obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as

. If any term
 provision
 covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be invalid
 illegal
 void or unenforceable
 the remainder of the terms
 provisions
 covenants and restrictions set forth herein
shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected
 impaired or invalidated
 and the parties hereto shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to find and employ an alternative means to achieve the same or substantially the same result
as that contemplated by such term
 provision
 covenant or restriction. It is hereby stipulated and declared to be the intention
of the parties that they would have executed the remaining terms
 provisions
 covenants and restrictions without including any
of such that may be hereafter declared invalid
 illegal
 void or unenforceable.

5.13
. If any certificate or instrument evidencing any Securities is mutilated
 lost
 stolen or destroyed
the Company shall issue or cause to be issued in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation thereof (in the case of mutilation)
or in lieu of and substitution therefor
 a new certificate or instrument
 but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory
to the Company of such loss
 theft or destruction. The applicant for a new certificate or instrument under such circumstances
shall also pay any reasonable third-party costs (including customary indemnity) associated with the issuance of such replacement
Securities.


    
    


5.14
. The obligations of each Purchaser under any Transaction
Document are several and not joint with the obligations of any other Purchaser
 and no Purchaser shall be responsible in any way
for the performance or non-performance of the obligations of any other Purchaser under any Transaction Document. Nothing contained
herein or in any other Transaction Document
 and no action taken by any Purchaser pursuant thereto
 shall be deemed to constitute
the Purchasers as a partnership
 an association
 a joint venture or any other kind of entity
 or create a presumption that the
Purchasers are in any way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Documents. Each Purchaser shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights
 including without
limitation
 the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of the other Transaction Documents
 and it shall not be necessary
for any other Purchaser to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose. Each Purchaser has been represented
by its own separate legal counsel in their review and negotiation of the Transaction Documents. The Company&rsquo;s counsel does
not represent any of the Purchasers. The Company has elected to provide all Purchasers with the same terms and Transaction Documents
for the convenience of the Company and not because it was required or requested to do so by the Purchasers.

5.15
. The parties agree that each of them and/or their respective counsel has reviewed and had an opportunity to
revise the Transaction Documents and
 therefore
 the normal rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be
resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of the Transaction Documents or any amendments
hereto.

 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
&#13;&amp;#8220;Leases&amp;#8221;
 to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. This ASU will require organizations that lease&#13;assets (&amp;#8220;lessees&amp;#8221;) to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on its balance sheet for all leases with&#13;terms of more than twelve months. A lease liability is a lessee&amp;#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
&#13;measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset represents the lessee&amp;#8217;s right to use
 or control use of
 a specified&#13;asset for the lease term. The amendments in this ASU leaves the accounting for the organization that own the assets leased to the&#13;lessee (&amp;#8220;lessor&amp;#8221;) largely unchanged except for targeted improvements to align it with the lessee accounting model and&#13;Topic 606

 the Company completed additional&#13;funding including a Private Placement Offering for common shares priced at $0.50 per share (subject to adjustment)
 resulting in&#13;the receipt of proceeds in the amount of $3.825 million and the issuance of 7
650
000 shares. The investors of this Private Placement&#13;Offering will be granted O warrants to be eligible to purchase an additional 0.50 shares for every share issued to each purchaser
&#13;exercisable for a period of 3 years at an exercise price of $0.60 per share
 (subject to adjustment). If the volume-weighted average&#13;trading price for the 20 consecutive trading days that conclude upon 6 months after the initial closing (the &amp;#8220;Six Month Price&amp;#8221;)&#13;exceeds or equals $0.50 per share (the &amp;#8220;Target Price&amp;#8221;)
 the per share purchase price will not be adjusted. If the Six&#13;Month Price is less than the Target Price
 the per share purchase price will be automatically reduced to the Six Month Price
 but&#13;in no event less than $0.35 per share
 in which case the Company shall issue to each investor
 pro-rata based on such investor&amp;#8217;s&#13;investment: (a) shares in a quantity that equals the difference between the number of shares issued to such purchaser at closing&#13;and the number of shares that would have been issued to such purchaser at closing at the Six Month Price; and (b) a warrant for&#13;a number of shares of common stock equal to 50% of the difference between the number of shares issued to such investor at closing&#13;and the number of shares that would have been issued to such investor at closing at the Six Month Price
 with an exercise price&#13;equal to the sum of $0.10 per share and the Six Month Price
 but in no eventless than $0.45 per share. The exercise price per share&#13;for each warrant will automatically adjust to the sum of $0.10 per share and the Six-Month Price
 but in no event less than $0.45&#13;per share. In addition
 the Company obtained a 24 month extension on $1
071
000 in principal
 and conversion of $720
000 of principal&#13;of the Milestone I Convertible Notes at a conversion price of $0.50 per share. The remaining $110

 2020. Specifically
 our business has been impacted by dining bans targeted at restaurants&#13;to reduce the size of public gatherings. We have noted restaurant chains have closed operations and furloughed employees which&#13;would preclude our single serve products from being served at those establishments for a number of weeks. Furthermore
 many school&#13;districts have closed regular attendance which could conceivably last to the end of the school year. This will directly impact&#13;the sales of our Bulk Product into that sales channel. Our headquarters are located in Los Angeles
 California
 where the entire&#13;state has been issued a &amp;#8220;shelter in place&amp;#8221; order from the Governor of California. Consequently
 our staff in the headquarter&#13;office are working remotely until further notice. At this point
 we have not experienced a disruption in the supply chain for&#13;manufacturing our products. The developments surrounding COVID-19 remain fluid and dynamic
 and consequently
 will require the&#13;Company to continue to monitor news headlines from government and health officials
 as well as

    
    


 we expect to experience significant increases in our working capital requirements. These conditions&#13;raise substantial doubt over the Company&amp;#8217;s ability to meet all of its obligations over the twelve months following the filing&#13;of this Form 10-K. Management has evaluated these conditions
 and concluded that current plans will alleviate this concern. As&#13;of December 31
 2019
 we had $1
091
374 of cash on the balance sheet. We have continued to significantly reduce core operating&#13;expenses
 reducing total General and Administrative Expense in 2019 by $962
859
 or 12%
 as compared with 2018. In addition
 in&#13;the first quarter of 2020
 the Company completed $3.825 million of funding. These&amp;#160;financings&amp;#160;included a Private Placement&#13;Offering for common shares priced at $0.50 cents per share. Moreover

 Series CN Notes investors who invested an additional 10% to 20% of the Series&#13;CN Note amount
 immediately received an additional 25% warrant coverage on their initial CN Note investment
 which would otherwise&#13;have been issued after one year. During April 2018
 we closed the CN Note acceleration offer in the amount of $177

A lease liability is a lessee&amp;#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
&#13;measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset represents the lessee&amp;#8217;s right to use
 or control use of
 a specified&#13;asset for the lease term. The amendments in this ASU leaves the accounting for the organization that own the assets leased to the&#13;lessee (&amp;#8220;lessor&amp;#8221;) largely unchanged except for targeted improvements to align it with the lessee accounting model and&#13;Topic 606

 we have one material lease subject to adoption of this standard
&#13;effective January 1
 2019. As disclosed in Note 8
 we entered into a new office space lease that took effect on April 1
 2019&#13;and recorded a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability for amounts that approximate our future commitments of $241

 the Company completed additional
funding including a Private Placement Offering for common shares priced at $0.50 per share (subject to adjustment)
 resulting in
the receipt of proceeds in the amount of $3.825 million and the issuance of 7
650
000 shares. The investors of this Private Placement
Offering will be granted O warrants to be eligible to purchase an additional 0.50 shares for every share issued to each purchaser
exercisable for a period of 3 years at an exercise price of $0.60 per share
 (subject to adjustment). If the volume-weighted average
trading price for the 20 consecutive trading days that conclude upon 6 months after the initial closing (the &#8220;Six Month Price&#8221;)
exceeds or equals $0.50 per share (the &#8220;Target Price&#8221;)
 the per share purchase price will not be adjusted. If the Six
Month Price is less than the Target Price
 the per share purchase price will be automatically reduced to the Six Month Price
 but
in no event less than $0.35 per share
 in which case the Company shall issue to each investor
 pro-rata based on such investor&#8217;s
investment: (a) shares in a quantity that equals the difference between the number of shares issued to such purchaser at closing
and the number of shares that would have been issued to such purchaser at closing at the Six Month Price; and (b) a warrant for
a number of shares of common stock equal to 50% of the difference between the number of shares issued to such investor at closing
and the number of shares that would have been issued to such investor at closing at the Six Month Price
 with an exercise price
equal to the sum of $0.10 per share and the Six Month Price
 but in no eventless than $0.45 per share. The exercise price per share
for each warrant will automatically adjust to the sum of $0.10 per share and the Six-Month Price
 but in no event less than $0.45
per share. In addition
 the Company obtained a 24 month extension on $1
071
000 in principal
 and conversion of $720
000 of principal
of the Milestone I Convertible Notes at a conversion price of $0.50 per share. The remaining $110
166 was extended for thirty days.
The interest rate on the principal balance of the extended Milestone I Convertible Notes was amended to 15%. Furthermore
 the Company
obtained a 12 month extension on $168
000 in principal
 and conversion of $1
128
000 in principal of the Milestone II Convertible
Notes. The remaining $67
200 was extended for thirty days. The Convertible Noteholders of the Milestone I and II Convertible Notes
were granted additional interest depending upon their election to convert or extend their Convertible Notes.


rapidly with events unfolding on a daily and weekly basis. The direct impact to our operations has begun to take affect at the
close of the first quarter ended March 31
 2020. Specifically
 our business has been impacted by dining bans targeted at restaurants
to reduce the size of public gatherings. We have noted restaurant chains have closed operations and furloughed employees which
would preclude our single serve products from being served at those establishments for a number of weeks. Furthermore
 many school
districts have closed regular attendance which could conceivably last to the end of the school year. This will directly impact
the sales of our Bulk Product into that sales channel. Our headquarters are located in Los Angeles
 California
 where the entire
state has been issued a &#8220;shelter in place&#8221; order from the Governor of California. Consequently
 our staff in the headquarter
office are working remotely until further notice. At this point
 we have not experienced a disruption in the supply chain for
manufacturing our products. The developments surrounding COVID-19 remain fluid and dynamic
 and consequently
 will require the
Company to continue to monitor news headlines from government and health officials
 as well as
 the business community.

 Convertible Notes
the Company issued Series CN Note acceleration offer convertible notes payable that provide variable conversion provisions. The
conversion terms of the convertible notes are variable based on certain factors
 such as the future price of the Company&#8217;s
common stock. The number of shares of common stock to be issued is based on the future price of the Company&#8217;s common stock
therefore the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the promissory note is indeterminate.


liabilities are estimated at the issuance date and are revalued at each subsequent reporting date. The Company recognized a derivative
liability and debt discount of $569
588 at March 14
 2018 related to the Series CN Convertible notes 1 of 2; $69
400 at April 11
2018 related to the Series CN Notes Warrant Acceleration; and $697
186 at November 30
 2018 related to the Series CN Convertible
note 2 of 2. The derivative liability was revalued at December 31
 2019 and 2018 with a value of $211
028 and $1
325
653. The Company
recorded a net gain of $1
114
625 and a net loss of $87
630 for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018 respectively related
to the derivative liability. The 2018 net loss consists of a $110
829 gain for a portion of the derivative liability being settled
upon a noteholders decision to convert their outstanding principal to equity under the terms of the convertible note agreement
and a loss of $198
459 from the change in fair value.


for CN Convertible Note 1 of 2 and CN Note Warrant Acceleration was calculated using the Black-Scholes model using the following
assumptions.

the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight of evidence
 it is more than likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized. After consideration of all the evidence
 both positive and negative
 management
has determined that a $10
395
000 and $7
969
000 allowance at December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively
 is necessary to reduce
the deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. The increase in the valuation allowance for the
current period is $2
426
000.


 2019
 we have a net operating
loss carry forward of approximately $37

known as Smoothie

in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the years reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

000 federally insured limit at December 31
 2019 and 2018. However
 we believe that cash on deposit

 the Company
adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-18
 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (&#8220;ASU 2016-18&#8221;)
 which enhances
and clarifies the guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows and requires
additional disclosures about restricted cash balances. At December 31
 2019
 the Company had $91

to our co-packing agreement with Yarnell Operations

Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 820
 (&#8220;ASC 820&#8221;)
provides a comprehensive framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures which are required about fair value measurements.
Specifically
 ASC 820 sets forth a definition of fair value and establishes a hierarchy prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques
giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and the lowest priority to
unobservable value inputs. ASC 820 defines the hierarchy as follows:


in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. The types of assets and liabilities included in
Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices
 such as equities listed on the New York Stock Exchange.


than quoted prices in active markets but are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The types of assets
and liabilities in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or contracts or priced with models using
highly observable inputs.


that are unobservable as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are those with inputs requiring
significant management judgment or estimation
 such as complex and subjective models and forecasts used to determine the fair value
of financial transmission rights.


accounts receivable
 accounts payable
 accrued expenses
 derivative liabilities
 and convertible notes. The carrying value of
our financial instruments approximates their fair value
 except for the derivative liability in which carrying value is fair value.








Our credit policy calls for payment generally within 30 days. The credit worthiness of a customer is evaluated prior to a sale.
As of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the company&#8217;s allowance for doubtful accounts was $141

was $89

 2019 and $61

and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows
are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison
of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that
the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable
 the carrying amount of such assets is
reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any impairment charges during the years presented.

 Revenue from Contracts
with Customers
 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains ownership of promised goods. The amount of revenue recognized reflects
the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods. The Company applies the following
five steps:



    
    
    

    
    
A contract with a customer exists when (i) the Company enters into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party&#8217;s rights
 (ii) the contract has commercial substance and
 (iii) the Company determines that collection of substantially all consideration for goods or services that are transferred is probable. For the Company
 the contract is the approved sales order
 which may also be supplemented by other agreements that formalize various terms and conditions with customers.

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer. For the Company
 this consists of the delivery of frozen beverages
 which provide immediate benefit to the customer.




    
    
    

    
    
The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods and is generally stated on the approved sales order. Variable consideration
 which typically includes volume-based rebates or discounts
 are estimated utilizing the most likely amount method.

    
    
    

    
    
    
Allocate the transaction price to performance
        obligations in the contract 

        obligation
 delivery of frozen beverages
 the transaction price is allocated to that single performance obligation.

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of frozen beverages when title and risk of loss passes and the customer accepts the goods
 which generally occurs at the time of delivery to a customer warehouse. Customer sales incentives such as volume-based rebates or discounts are treated as a reduction of sales at the time the sale is recognized. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and presented in distribution
 selling and administrative costs.

    
    
    

    
    
The company evaluated the requirement to disaggregate revenue and concluded that substantially all of its revenue comes from a single product
 frozen beverages.

general and administrative expenses. For the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 shipping and handling costs totaled $751
237
and $864

 respectively.








 2019
 the Company adopted
ASC 842. ASC 842 replaced the prior lease accounting guidance in its entirety. As disclosed in Note 7
 we entered into a new office
space lease that took effect on April 1
 2019 and recorded a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability for amounts that approximate
our future commitments of $241
555. Lease expense for finance leases consists of the amortization of the ROU asset on a straight-line
basis over the asset&#8217;s estimated useful life and is included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income.








in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740
 (&#8220;ASC 740&#8221;). Under this method
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date.


how companies should recognize
 measure
 present
 and disclose in their financial statements
 uncertain tax positions taken or
expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740
 tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when
it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially
and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon
ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.


the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight of evidence
 it is more than likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized.


 2019 and
2018 we did not have any interest and penalties or any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions.








options
 warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives
to be separately accounted for under ASC Topic 815
 &#8220;Derivatives and Hedging.&#8221; The result of this accounting treatment
is that the fair value of any derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event
that the fair value is recorded as a liability
 the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as gain/loss
from derivative liability. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument
 the instrument is marked to fair value at the
conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity. We analyzed the derivative financial instruments in accordance
with ASC 815. The objective is to provide guidance for determining whether an equity-linked financial instrument is indexed to
an entity&#8217;s own stock. This determination is needed for a scope exception which would enable a derivative instrument to
be accounted for under the accrual method. The classification of a non-derivative instrument that falls within the scope of ASC
815-40-05 &#8220;Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to
 and Potentially Settled in
 a Company&#8217;s Own
Stock&#8221; also hinges on whether the instrument is indexed to an entity&#8217;s own stock. A non-derivative instrument that
is not indexed to an entity&#8217;s own stock cannot be classified as equity and must be accounted for as a liability. There is
a two-step approach in determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity&#8217;s own stock. First
the instrument&#8217;s contingent exercise provisions
 if any
 must be evaluated
 followed by an evaluation of the instrument&#8217;s
settlement provisions. The Company utilized the fair value standard set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
 defined
as the amount at which the assets (or liability) could be bought (or incurred) or sold (or settled) in a current transaction between
willing parties
 that is
 other than in a forced or liquidation sale.








with ASC Topic 260
. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period
 and diluted earnings per share is computed by including common stock
equivalents outstanding for the period in the denominator. At December 31
 2019 and 2018 any equivalents would have been anti-dilutive
as we had losses for the periods then ended.








with ASC Topic 718
 (&#8220;ASC 718&#8221;). ASC 718 requires that the cost resulting
from all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement
objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair-value-based measurement
method in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees except for equity instruments held by employee stock
ownership plans

 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
&#8220;Leases&#8221;
 to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. This ASU will require organizations that lease
assets (&#8220;lessees&#8221;) to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on its balance sheet for all leases with
terms of more than twelve months. A lease liability is a lessee&#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset represents the lessee&#8217;s right to use
 or control use of
 a specified
asset for the lease term. The amendments in this ASU leaves the accounting for the organization that own the assets leased to the
lessee (&#8220;lessor&#8221;) largely unchanged except for targeted improvements to align it with the lessee accounting model and

known as Smoothie
 Inc.). All inter-company balances and transactions among the companies have been eliminated upon consolidation.

in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the years reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.




institutions exceeds the $250
000 federally insured limit at December 31
 2019 and 2018. However
 we believe that cash on deposit
that exceeds $250
000 in the financial institutions is financially sound and the risk of loss is minimal.




 the Company adopted
FASB ASU No. 2016-18
 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (&#8220;ASU 2016-18&#8221;)
 which enhances and clarifies
the guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows and requires additional disclosures
about restricted cash balances. At December 31
 2019
 the Company had $91
385 in restricted cash related to our co-packing agreement
with Yarnell Operations
 LLC.




Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 820
 (&#8220;ASC 820&#8221;)
provides a comprehensive framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures which are required about fair value measurements.
Specifically
 ASC 820 sets forth a definition of fair value and establishes a hierarchy prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques
giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and the lowest priority to
unobservable value inputs. ASC 820 defines the hierarchy as follows:


in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. The types of assets and liabilities included in
Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices
 such as equities listed on the New York Stock Exchange.


than quoted prices in active markets but are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The types of assets
and liabilities in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or contracts or priced with models using
highly observable inputs.


that are unobservable as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are those with inputs requiring
significant management judgment or estimation
 such as complex and subjective models and forecasts used to determine the fair value
of financial transmission rights.


accounts receivable
 accounts payable
 accrued expenses
 derivative liabilities
 and convertible notes. The carrying value of our
financial instruments approximates their fair value
 except for the derivative liability in which carrying value is fair value.




Our credit policy calls for payment generally within 30 days. The credit worthiness of a customer is evaluated prior to a sale.
As of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the company&#8217;s allowance for doubtful accounts was $141
788 and $61
788 respectively. There
was $89
397 of bad debt expense recorded for the year ended December 31
 2019 and $61
788 of bad debt expense for the year ended
December 31
 2018. The allowance was applied to certain receivable accounts which are over 95 days.




carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first in first out basis. The company monitors the remaining useful life
of its inventory and establishes a reserve of obsolescence where appropriate. As of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company&#8217;s
inventory reserve was $100
651 and $31
237 respectively.

and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows
are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison
of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that
the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable
 the carrying amount of such assets is reduced
to fair value. We have not recorded any impairment charges during the years presented.

cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss
 if any. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are being amortized over the shorter of the useful life of
the asset or the lease term that includes any expected renewal periods that are deemed to be reasonably assured. The estimated
useful lives used for financial statement purposes are:



    
    

    
    

    
    

    
    





 Revenue from Contracts
with Customers
 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains ownership of promised goods. The amount of revenue recognized reflects
the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods. The Company applies the following
five steps:



    
    
    

    
    
A contract with a customer exists when (i) the Company enters into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party&#8217;s rights
 (ii) the contract has commercial substance and
 (iii) the Company determines that collection of substantially all consideration for goods or services that are transferred is probable. For the Company
 the contract is the approved sales order
 which may also be supplemented by other agreements that formalize various terms and conditions with customers.

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer. For the Company
 this consists of the delivery of frozen beverages
 which provide immediate benefit to the customer.




    
    
    

    
    
The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods and is generally stated on the approved sales order. Variable consideration
 which typically includes volume-based rebates or discounts
 are estimated utilizing the most likely amount method.

    
    
    

    
    
    
Allocate the transaction price to performance
        obligations in the contract 

        obligation
 delivery of frozen beverages
 the transaction price is allocated to that single performance obligation.

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of frozen beverages when title and risk of loss passes and the customer accepts the goods
 which generally occurs at the time of delivery to a customer warehouse. Customer sales incentives such as volume-based rebates or discounts are treated as a reduction of sales at the time the sale is recognized. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and presented in distribution
 selling and administrative costs.

    
    
    

    
    
The company evaluated the requirement to disaggregate revenue and concluded that substantially all of its revenue comes from a single product
 frozen beverages.

general and administrative expenses. For the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 shipping and handling costs totaled $751
237
and $864
871
 respectively.




 2019
 the Company adopted
ASC 842. ASC 842 replaced the prior lease accounting guidance in its entirety. As disclosed in Note 7
 we entered into a new office
space lease that took effect on April 1
 2019 and recorded a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability for amounts that approximate
our future commitments of $241
555. Lease expense for finance leases consists of the amortization of the ROU asset on a straight-line
basis over the asset&#8217;s estimated useful life and is included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income.




in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740
 (&#8220;ASC 740&#8221;). Under this method
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date.


how companies should recognize
 measure
 present
 and disclose in their financial statements
 uncertain tax positions taken or
expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740
 tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when
it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially
and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon
ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.


the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight of evidence
 it is more than likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized.


 2019 and 2018
we did not have any interest and penalties or any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions.




options
 warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives
to be separately accounted for under ASC Topic 815
 &#8220;Derivatives and Hedging.&#8221; The result of this accounting treatment
is that the fair value of any derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event
that the fair value is recorded as a liability
 the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as gain/loss
from derivative liability. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument
 the instrument is marked to fair value at the
conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity. We analyzed the derivative financial instruments in accordance
with ASC 815. The objective is to provide guidance for determining whether an equity-linked financial instrument is indexed to
an entity&#8217;s own stock. This determination is needed for a scope exception which would enable a derivative instrument to be
accounted for under the accrual method. The classification of a non-derivative instrument that falls within the scope of ASC 815-40-05
&#8220;Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to
 and Potentially Settled in
 a Company&#8217;s Own Stock&#8221;
also hinges on whether the instrument is indexed to an entity&#8217;s own stock. A non-derivative instrument that is not indexed
to an entity&#8217;s own stock cannot be classified as equity and must be accounted for as a liability. There is a two-step approach
in determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity&#8217;s own stock. First
 the instrument&#8217;s
contingent exercise provisions
 if any
 must be evaluated
 followed by an evaluation of the instrument&#8217;s settlement provisions.
The Company utilized the fair value standard set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
 defined as the amount at which
the assets (or liability) could be bought (or incurred) or sold (or settled) in a current transaction between willing parties
that is
 other than in a forced or liquidation sale.




with ASC Topic 260
. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period
 and diluted earnings per share is computed by including common stock
equivalents outstanding for the period in the denominator. At December 31
 2019 and 2018 any equivalents would have been anti-dilutive
as we had losses for the periods then ended.




with ASC Topic 718
 (&#8220;ASC 718&#8221;). ASC 718 requires that the cost resulting
from all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement
objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair-value-based measurement
method in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees except for equity instruments held by employee stock ownership
plans




 new accounting pronouncements
are issued that we adopt as of the specified effective date. We believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not
yet effective may have an impact on our results of operations and financial position.


 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
&#8220;Leases&#8221;
 to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. This ASU will require organizations that lease
assets (&#8220;lessees&#8221;) to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on its balance sheet for all leases with
terms of more than twelve months. A lease liability is a lessee&#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset represents the lessee&#8217;s right to use
 or control use of
 a specified
asset for the lease term. The amendments in this ASU leaves the accounting for the organization that own the assets leased to the
lessee (&#8220;lessor&#8221;) largely unchanged except for targeted improvements to align it with the lessee accounting model and
