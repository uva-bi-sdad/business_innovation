As used in this Annual Report
 the terms we, us, our, Olivia, and &#8220;Issuer&#8221; mean Olivia
 Inc. unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

























We are a development stage company incorporated in the State of Delaware on August 2
 2011
 as a for-profit company
 and established a fiscal year end of December 31. The business plan of the Company is to create an online bread club
 which allows members to purchase baked goods and also provide input and recipes online.


Our Registration Statement went live on April 19
 2013. On September 2
 2013
 we issued 237
500 shares of common stock to various shareholders at a price of $0.16 per share
 for $38
000.


Since the conclusion of our offering
 we began to design the website for our online bread club. We intend to use all the proceeds from the offering over the next 12 month period.





We intend
 in due course
 subject to legal advice
 to apply for trademark protection
 patent and/or copyright protection in the applicable jurisdictions. Currently
 we have no intellectual property for which to apply for trademark
 patent and/or copyright protection. We believe that as the Company develops it may create designs or web content for which intellectual property protection can be sought.


If appropriate
 we intend to aggressively assert our rights trademark and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property
 including product technology
 product research and concepts and recognized trademarks. These rights are protected through the acquisition of trademark registrations
 the maintenance of copyrights
 and
 where appropriate
 litigation against those who are
 in our opinion
 infringing these rights.


While there can be no assurance that registered trademarks and copyrights will protect our proprietary information
 we intend to assert our intellectual property rights against any infringer. Although any assertion of our rights can result in a substantial cost to
 and diversion of effort by
 our Company
 management believes that the protection of our intellectual property rights is a key component of our operating strategy.





We are unaware of and do not anticipate having to expend significant resources to comply with any governmental regulations. We are subject to the laws and regulations of those jurisdictions in which we plan to conduct our social networking meetings and sell advertising
 which are generally applicable to business operations
 such as business licensing requirements
 income taxes and payroll taxes. In general
 the development and operation of our business is not subject to special regulatory and/or supervisory requirements.





As the date of this Annual Report
 Olivia has no permanent staff other than our President Elchanan Menachem Grossbaum and our Secretary Eliezer Prager who are employed elsewhere and have the flexibility to work on Olivia up to 20 hours per week. They are both prepared to devote more time to our operations as may be required and as our finances permit.


Currently
 we have not entered into an employment agreement with our officers. The Company presently does not have pension
 health
 annuity
 insurance
 stock options
 profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however
 the Company may adopt plans in the future. Management does not plan to hire additional employees at this time. Depending on the success of this offering we plan to retain web development
 data entry and editorial staff initially on a contract basis. Our two officers and two directors will be responsible for the initial operations management. Once the Company launches its social networking meetings and website
 it may hire a full time website operations manager and an event planner.
























In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 stockholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors:








At December 31
 2013
 we had $32
584 cash on-hand
 our current liabilities were $13
651 and our cumulative net loss since inception was $38
478. Therefore
 there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We have incurred limited operating losses since our formation and expect to incur losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future
 and we may not achieve profitability. We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. We also expect to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operating losses and capital expenditures until our bread club becomes a viable business. As a result
 we will need to generate significant revenues from the online artisan bread business in order to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not be able to generate these revenues
 build a strong customer base or achieve profitability in the future. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the value of our business.

OUR LACK OF AN OPERATING HISTORY GIVES NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR FUTURE OPERATIONS WILL RESULT IN PROFITABLE REVENUES
 WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE SUSPENSION OR END OF OUR OPERATIONS AND THE LOSS OF ANY INVESTMENT.


We were incorporated on August 2
 2011 and we have not realized any revenues to date. We have no operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon the completion of this offering and our ability to generate revenues through sales of our service/intended products.


At December 31
 2013
 we had $ 32
584 cash on hand
 our current liabilities were $13
651 and our net loss since inception was $38
478. We have incurred operating losses since our formation and expect to incur losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future
 and we may not achieve profitability. We also expect to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operating losses and capital expenditures. As a result we will need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not be able to generate these revenues or achieve profitability in the future. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the value of our business and may cause us to go out of business.




We have not developed an online bread club service including website content and website software. We do not know the exact cost of its execution and the costs related with logistics after sales. In the case of a higher than expected cost of execution
 we will not be able to offer our online bread club service. Furthermore
 we may find problems in the process to develop such an online bread club. If we are unable to execute the online bread club
 we will have to cease our operations
 resulting in the complete loss of your investment.







Our Officers and Directors do not have experience in developing an online bread club or in the development of a website. Additionally
 we currently have no customers or advertisers of our bread club. Therefore
 without this experience
 our management&#8217;s business experience may not be enough to effectively start-up and maintain our company. As a result
 the implementation of our business plan may be delayed
 or eventually
 unsuccessful.














BECAUSE WE ARE SMALL AND DO NOT HAVE MUCH CAPITAL
 WE MUST LIMIT OUR MARKETING ACTIVITIES. AS A RESULT
 OUR SALES MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO OPERATE PROFITABLY. IF WE DO NOT MAKE A PROFIT
 WE MAY HAVE TO SUSPEND OR CEASE OPERATIONS WHICH WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF YOUR INVESTMENT


Due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital
 we must limit our marketing activities to potential customers having the likelihood of purchasing our service. We intend to generate revenue through the sale of our services. Because we will be limiting the scope of our marketing activities
 we may not be able to generate enough sales to operate profitably. If we cannot operate profitably
 we may have to suspend or cease operations.




We are a new company with no established visibility or recognition in the artisan bread community. Since our brand is not established and our service is not going to be recognized within the industry
 we may have trouble placing our products within the artisan and specialty brand community: If we are not able to have our bread sold to our marketplace and our intended services on our website
 we may not be able to generate revenues and our business plan may fail.




Our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors
 many of which we have no control. Factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly include: our inability to generate enough working capital from future equity sales; the level of commercial acceptance by consumers of our online bread club; fluctuations in the demand for our online artisan bread club; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our business
 operations and infrastructure and general economic conditions.


If realized
 any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and operating results.


OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS MAY NOT BE IN A POSITION TO DEVOTE A MAJORITY OF THEIR TIME TO OUR OPERATIONS
 WHICH MAY RESULT IN PERIODIC INTERRUPTIONS AND EVEN BUSINESS FAILURE.

Our officers and Directors have other outside business activities and are devoting approximately 5-10 hours per week to our operations. They are
 however
 prepared to devote additional time if required. Our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are not convenient to them which may result in periodic interruptions or suspensions of our business plan. Such delays could have a significant negative effect on the success of the business.

IF OUR COMPANY IS DISSOLVED
 IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE SUFFICIENT ASSETS REMAINING TO DISTRIBUTE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS.


In the event of the dissolution of our company
 the proceeds realized from the liquidation of our assets
 if any
 will be used primarily to pay the claims of our creditors
 if any
 before there can be any distribution to the shareholders. In that case
 the ability of purchasers of the offered shares to recover all or any portion of the purchase price for the offered shares will depend on the amount of funds realized and the claims to be satisfied there from.





We have not assembled our management team as a result of our relatively limited activities to date. In addition
 we have only two management members which may be insufficient to run our operation. As a result
 we may be unable to effectively develop and manage our business and we may fail.

















COMPETITORS MAY ENTER THIS SECTOR WITH SUPERIOR SERVICES
 INFRINGING OUR CUSTOMER BASE
 AND AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS ADVERSELY.


We have identified a market opportunity for our online artisan bread company. Competitors may enter this sector with superior manufacturing
 logistics
 prices
 or benefits. This would infringe on our customer base
 having an adverse effect upon our business and the results of our operations.


SINCE OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CURRENTLY OWN 84% OF THE OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK



Our officers and directors
 Messrs. Grossbaum and Prager
 own 1
250
000 shares of common stock representing 84% of our outstanding stock following the sale of 237
500 shares pursuant to our Registration Statement. As a result
 they have control of us even if the full offering was subscribed for and be able to choose all of our directors. Their interests may differ from the ones of other stockholders. Factors that could cause their interests to differ from the other stockholders include the impact of corporate transactions on the timing of business operations and their ability to continue to manage the business given the amount of time they are able to devote to us.


All decisions regarding the management of our affairs will be made exclusively by them. Purchasers of the offered shares may not participate in our management and
 therefore
 are dependent upon her management abilities. The only assurance that our shareholders
 including purchasers of the offered shares
 have that our officers and directors will not abuse their discretion in executing our business affairs
 is their fiduciary obligation and business integrity. Such discretionary powers include
 but are not limited to
 decisions regarding all aspects of business operations
 corporate transactions and financing. Our officers also have the ability to accomplish or ratify actions at the shareholder level which would otherwise implicate their fiduciary duties if done as one of the members of our board of directors.


Accordingly
 no person should purchase the offered shares unless willing to entrust all aspects of management to the officers and directors
 or their successors. Potential purchasers of the offered shares must carefully evaluate the personal experience and business performance of our management.





WE ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE A TIME TABLE FOR THE EXECUTION OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN
 WHICH CASTS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ON THE VIABILITY OF OUR BUSINESS AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.


We initially anticipated that we would requirea total of $100
000 in order to implement our business plan. We raised a total of $58
000 -- $20
000 from our officers and directors and $38
000 from the sale of shares pursuant to the Registration Statement. Additionally
 we anticipate that virtually all aspects of our business plan must be executed concurrently or near concurrently with each other in order for us to generate more than nominal revenues. Because we have taken no steps to identify other potential sources of financing that we may require to execute our business plan
 we cannot estimate if or when we will obtain additional financing. Therefore
 we are also unable to provide a timeline for the implementation of our business plan. Our inability to provide a timeline for the implementation of our business plan at this time casts substantial doubt on the viability of our business and will have an adverse impact on our ability to attract investors
 which may cause the business to fail. Any investment in our business is therefore highly speculative. We intend to allocate $20
000 of the raise to offering and administrative expenses. The remaining $38
000 is intended for bread club development activities
 such as analyzing which private label manufactures
 software firms
 and hosting firms are needed to implement our online bread club.



















In their audit report dated February 16
 2014
 our auditors have expressed an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as an ongoing business. Because our officers may be unwilling or unable to loan or advance any additional capital to us
 we believe that if we do not raise additional capital
 we may be required to suspend or cease the implementation of our business plan. Due to the fact that there is no minimum investment and no refunds on sold shares
 you may be investing in a company that will not have the funds necessary to develop its business strategies. As such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your entire investment. See the Auditors Report accompanying our Audited Financial Statements. Because we have been issued an opinion by our auditor that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as a going concern it may be more difficult to attract investors.


THE ENACTMENT OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO RETAIN OR ATTRACT OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS
 WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS OR PREVENT US FROM BECOMING PROFITABLE.


The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the &#8220;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#8221;) was enacted in response to public concern regarding corporate accountability in the wake of a number of accounting scandals. The stated goals of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are to increase corporate responsibility
 provide enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosure pursuant to applicable securities laws. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act applies to all companies that file or are required to file periodic reports with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;).


Upon becoming a public company
 we will be required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has resulted in the imposition of a series of rules and regulations by the SEC that increase the responsibilities and liabilities of directors and executive officer
 the perceived increased personal risk associated with these changes may deter qualified individuals from accepting such roles. Consequently
 it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve as our directors or executive officer
 and we may need to incur additional operating costs. This could prevent us from becoming profitable.


SINCE WE ANTICIPATE OPERATING EXPENSES WILL INCREASE PRIOR TO EARNING REVENUE
 WE MAY NEVER ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY.


We anticipate an increase in our operating expenses
 without realizing any revenues from the sale of bread. Within the next 18 months
 we will have costs related to (i) creating the bread club
 (ii) initiation of our marketing campaign
 (iii) administrative expenses
 and (iv) the expenses of this offering.


There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful. We cannot provide investors with any assurance that our service will attract customers; generate any operating revenue or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unable to address these risks
 there is a high probability that our business can fail
 which will result in the loss of your entire investment.


WE MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO CARRY OUT OUR BUSINESS PLAN. IF WE CANNOT SECURE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL
 OR IF AVAILABLE CAPITAL IS TOO EXPENSIVE
 OUR BUSINESS WILL FAIL.


If we are not successful in earning revenue once we have started our sales activity
 we may require additional financing to sustain our business operations. Currently
 we do not have any arrangements for financing and can provide no assurances to investors that we will be able to obtain any when required. Obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number of factors
 including our sales results. These factors may have an effect on the timing
 amount
 terms or conditions of additional financing and make such additional financing unavailable to us.
















BEACUSE OUR REGISTRATION STATEMENT HAS BEEN DECLARED EFFECTIVE
 WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE SEC&#8217;S REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO MAINTAIN THIS REPORTING STATUS WITH THE SEC.


Our registration statement was declared effective on April 19
 2013. We have limited reporting obligations pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. If we fail to meet our reporting obligations
 we will lose our reporting status with the SEC. Our management believes that if we cannot maintain our reporting status with the SEC we will have to cease all efforts directed towards developing our company. In that event
 any investment in the company could be lost in its entirety.





Each state has its own securities laws
 often called &#8220;blue sky&#8221; laws
 which (1) limit sales of securities to a state&#8217;s residents unless the securities are registered in that state or qualify for an exemption from registration
 and (2) govern the reporting requirements for broker-dealers doing business directly or indirectly in the state. Before a security is sold in a state
 there must be a registration in place to cover the transaction
 or it must be exempt from registration. The applicable broker-dealer must also be registered in that state.


We do not know whether our securities will be registered or exempt from registration under the laws of any state. A determination regarding registration will be made by those broker-dealers
 if any
 who agree to serve as market makers for our common stock. We have not yet applied to have our securities registered in any state. There may be significant state blue sky law restrictions on the ability of investors to sell
 and on purchasers to buy
 our securities. You should therefore consider the resale market for our common stock to be limited
 as you may be unable to resell your shares without the significant expense of state registration or qualification.





 2014 there are fewer than 300 shareholders. If we do not become a reporting issuer and instead make a decision to suspend our public reporting
 we will no longer be obligated to file periodic reports with SEC and your access to our business information will be restricted. In addition
 if we do not become a reporting issuer
 we will not be required to furnish proxy statements to security holders
 and our directors
 officers and principal beneficial owners will not be required to report their beneficial ownership of securities to the SEC pursuant to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS
 ARE LOCATED IN ISRAEL. ANY ATTEMPT TO ENFORCE LIABILITIES UPON THEM UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES AND BANKRUPTCY LAWS MAY BE DIFFICULT.

Since our Officers and Directors
 are located in Israel
 any attempt to enforce liabilities upon such individual under the U.S. securities and bankruptcy laws may be difficult.

In accordance with the Israeli Law on Enforcement of Foreign Judgments
 5718-1958
 and subject to certain time limitations (the application to enforce the judgment must be made within five years of the date of judgment or such other period as might be agreed between Israel and the United States)
 an Israeli court may declare a foreign civil judgment enforceable if it finds that:








the judgment was rendered by a court which was
 according to the laws of the State in which the court is located
 competent to render the judgment;

















































































the time the action was instituted in the foreign court
 a suit in the same matter and between the same parties was pending before a court or tribunal in Israel.




In general
 an obligation imposed by the judgment of a United States court is enforceable according to the rules relating to the enforceability of judgments in Israel
 and a United States court is considered competent to render judgments according to the laws of private international law in Israel.

Furthermore
 Israeli courts may not adjudicate a claim based on a violation of U.S. securities laws if the court determines that Israel is not the most appropriate forum in which to bring such a claim. Even if an Israeli court agrees to hear such a claim
 it may determine that Israeli law
 not U.S. law
 is applicable to the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable
 the content of applicable U.S. law must be proven as a fact
 which can be a time-consuming and costly process.

Since our Directors and Officers do not reside in the United States it may be difficult for courts in the United States to obtain jurisdiction over our foreign assets or persons
 and
 as a result
 it may be difficult or impossible for you to enforce judgments rendered against us or our Directors or Officers in United States courts. Thus
 investing in us may pose a greater risk because should any situation arise in the future in which you have a cause of action against these persons or us
 you may face potential difficulties in bringing lawsuits or
 if successful
 in collecting judgments against these persons or us.



WE ARE AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY AND WE INTENED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF REDUCED DISCLOSURE AND GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES
 WHICH COULD RESULT IN OUR STOCK BEING LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS.

We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012
 which we refer to as the JOBS Act
 and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including
 but not limited to
 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements
 and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result
 there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We expect to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company
 which in certain circumstances could be for up to five years.



Pursuant to the JOBS Act of 2012
 as an emerging growth company the Company can elect to take advantage of the extended transition period for any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the PCAOB or the SEC. The Company has elected take advantage of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies
 the Company
 as an emerging growth company
 can adopt the standard for the private company. This may make comparison of the Company's financial statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as possible different or revised standards may be used.


















The JOBS Act is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on &#8220;emerging growth companies. The Company meets the definition of an emerging growth company and so long as it qualifies as an &#8220;emerging growth company
&#8221; it will
 among other things:











BECAUSE THE COMPANY QUALIFIES AS AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY AND AS A SMALLER REPORTING COMPANY
 IT IS RELEIVED OF MANY GOVERNANCE AND DISLCOSURE ISSUES INCLUDING THE FACT THAT THE COMPANY&#8217;S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO ATTEST TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY&#8217;S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

Because the Company has elected to take advantage of the extended time periods for compliance with new or revised accounting standards provided for under Section 102(b) of the JOBS Act
 among other things
 this means that the Company's independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting so long as it qualifies as an emerging growth company
 which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in the internal control over financial reporting go undetected. The Company would also be exempt from these requirements as a smaller reporting company. Likewise
 so long as it qualifies as an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company
 the Company may elect not to provide certain information
 including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of executive officers
 that would otherwise have been required to provide in filings with the SEC
 which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate the Company. As a result
 investor confidence in the Company and the market price of its common stock may be adversely affected.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT&#8217;S COMMON EQUITY
 RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES







There is currently no market for our shares. We cannot give you any assurance that the shares will ever have a market or that if a market for our shares ever develops
 that you will be able to sell your shares. In addition
 even if a public market for our shares develops
 there is no assurance that a secondary public market will be sustained.


The shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol OTCBB &#8220;OLIA&#8221;
 but no active trading market has developed and we cannot assure you that an active trading market will ever develop.





As of February 19
 2014 we had outstanding 1
487
500 shares of common stock
 which were held by 38 non-affiliated stockholders of record and 2 affiliated stockholders of records.





Since our inception
 we have not declared nor paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our current policy is to retain any earnings in order to finance our operations. Our Board of Directors will determine future declarations and payments of dividends
 if any
 in light of the then-current conditions it deems relevant and in accordance with applicable corporate law.











During the fiscal year ended December 31
 2013
 except as included in our Registration Statement that went effective on April 19
 2013 we have not sold any equity securities not registered under the Securities Act.




During each month within the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31
 2013
 neither we nor any &#8220;affiliated purchaser
&#8221; as that term is defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act
 repurchased any of our common stock or other securities.



























We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on August 2
 2011
 as a for-profit company
 and an established fiscal year end of December 31. Our Registration Statement went live on April 19
 2013. On September 2
 2013
 pursuant to our Registration Statement
 we issued 237
500 shares of common stock to various shareholders at a price of $0.16 per share
 for $38
000.


Since the conclusion of our offering
 we have begun to design the website for our online bread club. We intend to use all the proceeds from the offering over the next 12 month period.





In the second quarter of 2014
 we intend to post on sites like www.odesk.com and solicit bids for the development of the website and back end software.




We plan to spend the remainder of the 12 months after this offering focused on contracting with the private label manufacturer and marketing our website. We will register our website on a large number of search engines
 using various SEO techniques
 and also purchase AdWords on Google.


If we are unable to complete any phase of our website development or marketing efforts because we do not have enough resources
 we believe that we will have to cease our search for contract manufacturer
 development and or marketing operations until we raise more money. Attempting to raise capital after failing in any phase of our bread club development plan would be difficult. As such
 if we cannot secure additional proceeds we may have to cease marketing our website which may negatively affect investors&#8217; investment.







We anticipate that we will require total financing of $100
000 to execute our business plan over a 12 month period. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available or available on suitable terms.


We have not raised these funds yet but we still intend to design
 launch and market our website that shall include our online bread club. We intend to use all the proceeds from the offering over the 12 month period after completion thereof.


The Company has done market research on the artisan bread industry and has reviewed potential white label manufacturers. The Company intends to begin development of recipes
 website and conclude negotiations with a previously identified white label manufacturer of bread. We then plan to develop a specification list for features of the website.


Additionally
 one of our officers and directors has strong experience in on-line food retailing and we intend to utilize his expertise in pursuing our business plan.







Based on our initial research which included reviewing contract bread manufacturers
 we believe any search for a contract manufacturer of bread and development of the website and software to take between 2-3 months. During such period
 we will plan our marketing strategy
 based in part on the percentage of the offering sold and the cash available.

We plan to spend the next two quarters focused on contracting with the private label manufacturer and marketing our website. We will register our website in a large number of search engines
 using various SEO techniques
 and also purchase AdWords on Google.

&#160;If we are unable to complete any phase of our website development or marketing efforts because we do not have enough resources
 we believe that we will have to cease our search for contract manufacturer
 development and or marketing operations until we raise money. Attempting to raise capital after failing in any phase of our bread club development plan would be difficult. As such
 if we cannot secure additional proceeds we may have to cease marketing our website which may negatively affect investors&#8217; investment.







In the twelve month period ending December 31
 2013 we had no revenue and total expenses of $37
910
 current liabilities of $13
651 and a cumulative net loss since inception of $38
478. Our expenses were largely related to professional fee and costs related to the Registration Statement.


















As of December 31
 2013
 the Company had total current assets of $33
173 and total current liabilities of $13
651. The cash and cash equivalents was $32
584 as of December 31
 2013 compared to $25 as of December 31
 2012. Our cumulative net loss since inception is $38
478.

The net cash provided by financing activities was $58
000 for the twelve month period ended December 31
 2013
 2013&#160;compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $593 for the twelve months ended December 31
 2012.&#160;This increase is attributed to share issuance for cash during the twelve months December 31
 2013.&#160;Net cash provided by financing activities was $58
593 for the period of inception (August 2
 2011) through December 31
 2013.

Our auditors have issued an explanatory note regarding &#8220;going concern&#8221;
 meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from our intended offering and implemented our plan of operations. Our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in our effective registration statement. We must raise additional cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. In the event of the failure to complete our financing we would need to seek capital from other resources such as debt financing
 which may not even be available to us.


Management believes that if subsequent private placements are successful
 we will generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof. However
 additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all
 and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements.


We do not anticipate researching any further products or services other than the ones described in the business section above nor the purchase of any significant equipment. The health bars to be sold shall be provided by our suppliers and partners. Our company believes that
 due to the fact that we have not implemented our business plan and have not generated any revenues yet
 it is important to keep the focus on our business plan before starting researching for new products and services
 depending on the results of our plan of operation We also do not expect any significant additions to the number of employees
 as the company intends to hire third party consultants when necessary.


The Company&#8217;s sole Officers and Directors
 Elchanan Menachem Grossbaum and Eliyahu Prager&#160;have indicated at this time that they may be willing to provide funds required to maintain the reporting status in the form of a non-secured loan for the next twelve months as the expenses are incurred if no other proceeds are obtained by the Company. However
 there is no contract in place or written agreement securing this agreement. Management believes if the Company cannot maintain its reporting status with the SEC it will have to cease all efforts directed towards the Company. As such
 any investment previously made would be lost in its entirety.

We went public on April 19
 2013and
 by doing so
 have incurred and will continue to incur additional significant expenses for legal
 accounting and related services. Once we become a public entity
 subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act of '34
 we will incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting
 legal and a host of other expenses including annual reports and proxy statements
 if required. We estimate that these costs will range up to $50
000 per year for the next few years and will be higher if our business volume and activity increases but lower during the first year of being public because our overall business volume will be lower
 and we will not yet be subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 until we exceed $75 million in market capitalization.


These obligations will reduce our ability and resources to expand our business. We hope to be able to use our status as a public company to increase our ability to use noncash means of settling obligations and compensate independent contractors who provide professional services to us
 although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of those efforts. We will reduce the compensation levels paid to management if there is insufficient cash generated from operations to satisfy these costs.

Olivia

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Olivia
 Inc. (&#8220;the Company&#8221;) as of December 31
 2013 and 2012 and the related statements of operations
 changes in stockholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for the years then ended and for the period from inception (August 2
 2011) through December 31
 2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion
 the financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of Olivia Inc as of December 31
 2013 and 2012 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the period described above in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements
 the Company is in the development stage
 and has not established any source of revenue to cover its operating costs. As of December 31
 2013
 the Company does not have sufficient working capital and cash resources to meet its planned business objectives. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. Management&#8217;s plan regarding these matters is also described in Note 1 to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

OLIVIA
 INC.






Olivia Inc is a Delaware company (the &#8220;Company&#8221;)
 incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on August 02
 2011. The Company is in the development stage as defined by Accounting Standards Codification 915 (ASC 915)
 &#8220;Accounting and reporting by Development Stage Enterprises&#8221;
 the Company is devoting substantially all of its efforts to development of business plans. The business plan of the Company is to create an online bread club
 which allows members to purchase baked goods and also provide input and recipes online.














The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As at December 31
 2013
 the Company has a loss from operations of $37
910 an accumulated deficit of $38
478 and has earned no revenues since inception. The Company intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements
 which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures
 working capital and other cash requirements for the year ending December 31
 2014.


The ability of the Company to emerge from the development stage is dependent upon
 among other things
 obtaining additional financing to continue operations
 and development of its business plan. In response to these problems
 management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings.


These factors
 among others
 raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.









The principal accounting policies are set out below
 these policies have been consistently applied to the period presented
 unless otherwise stated:



Cash and equivalents include investments with initial maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its cash balances at credit-worthy financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250
000.

















Property
 Plant and Equipment
The Company does not own any property
 plant and equipment.







The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260
 Earnings Per Share ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the effects of all potential dilutive common shares
 which comprise options granted to employees. As at December 31
 2013
 the Company had no potentially dilutive shares.



Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 740
 &#8220;Income Taxes.&#8221; Under the asset and liability method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (temporary differences). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.



































































The above loan is unsecured
 bears no interest and has no set terms of repayment. This loan is repayable on demand.






















On August 15
 2012
 the Company issued 1
250
000 shares of common stock to the two directors and officers of the Company at a price of $0.016 per share
 for $20
000
 for initial capital (stock subscription receivable). The proceeds from this stock subscription was received on January 11
 2013.


On September 2
 2013
 the Company issued 237
500 shares of common stock to various shareholders at a price of $0.16 per share
 for $38
000. The proceeds from the sale of shares
 net of professional fees was deposited into the Company&#8217;s bank account on September 25
 2013
 net of professional fees.



The (benefit)/provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31
 2013 and 2012
 was as follows (assuming a 15% effective tax rate):

The Corporation had deferred income tax assets as of December 31

 as follows:

The Company provided a valuation allowance equal to the deferred income tax assets for period ended December 31
 2013 because it is not presently known whether future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize the loss carryforwards.

As of December 31
 2013
 the Company had approximately $38
478 in tax loss carryforwards that can be utilized future periods to reduce taxable income
 and expire by the year 2033.





The federal income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by the IRS
 generally for three years after they are filed.
























In September 2006
 the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 &#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221;. The objective of SFAS 157 (ASC 820) is to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and to expand disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 (ASC 820) defines fair value
 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles
 and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 (ASC 820) applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements.

From time to time
 the director and stockholder of the Company provides advances to the Company for its working capital purposes. These advances bear no interest and are due on demand.




In July 2013
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2013-11: Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward
 a Similar Tax Loss
 or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists. The new guidance requires that unrecognized tax benefits be presented on a net basis with the deferred tax assets for such carryforwards. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15
 2013. We do not expect the adoption of the new provisions to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.




In accordance with ASC 855-10
 Company management reviewed all material events through the date of this report and determined that there are no additional material subsequent events to report.

























Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer&#8217;s management
 including the principal executive and principal financial officer
 or persons performing similar functions
 as appropriate
 to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Any controls and procedures
 no matter how well designed and operated
 can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.

We have carried out an evaluation
 under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report.


Based on that evaluation
 our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.




Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
 as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This annual report does not include a report of management's assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting due to a transition period established by rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission for newly public companies.





There were no significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our fourth fiscal quarter
 that could materially affect
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

The following is a brief account of the education and business experience of our directors and executive officers during at least the past five years
 indicating their principal occupations and employment during the period
 and the name and principal business of the organization in which such occupations or employment were carried on.








From 2011 to the present
 Mr. Grossbaum has been&#160;the coordinator of Matzila a non-school based
 community education program funded by the Israel Interior Ministry. Mr. Grossbaum&#8217;s responsibilities include all organizational and operational aspects of the program for student ranging from elementary school through high school. At Matzila
 Mr. Grossbaum brings his vision for change for the students and implements learning processes to assist moving these students into the regular school system. He is&#160;responsible for&#160;management and professional development&#160;and&#160;managing relationships between the school and the community.&#160;Mr. Grossbaum has a wide&#160;experience&#160;in&#160;management which were supported by&#160;management&#160;courses
 among them the C.B.T course given by the Kiviti&#160;institute. From 2008 till the present
 Mr. Grossbaum is also the&#160;head master of Shearei Tvuna where he is the&#160;head&#160;of&#160;education.





Since 2010 Mr. Prager is the co-owner of an online retail food company Yashir for you. The company operates a web site which sells home delivered food products. As one of the founders of&#160;the company
 Mr.&#160;Prager developed the business concept
 the financial plan
 planned the web site and implemented them. He now oversees marketing and the financial aspect of the company. In addition Mr. Prager's&#160;responsibilities&#160;include all the company's logistics management. From 2008-10
 prior to founding Yashir for You
&#160;Mr. Prager was in Sheirut Leumi (a form of National Service) assisting children with their educational studies 2008-2010. Mr. Prager on-line retail experience and his management and people skills will help the company.




We do not presently have a separately constituted audit committee
 compensation committee
 nominating committee
 executive committee or any other committees of our Board of Directors. As such
 our entire Board of Directors acts as our audit committee.





Our Board of Directors does not currently have any member who qualifies as an audit committee financial expert. We believe that the cost related to retaining such a financial expert at this time is prohibitive. Further
 because we are in the start-up stage of our business operations
 we believe the services of an audit committee financial expert are not warranted at this time.




















None of our Directors
 nominee for Directors
 or officers has appeared as a party during the past ten years in any legal proceedings that may bear on his ability or integrity to serve as a Director or officer of the Company.





The Company has chosen to combine the principal executive officer and Board chairman positions. The Company believes that this Board leadership structure is the most appropriate for the Company for the following reasons. First
 the Company is a development stage company and at this early stage it is more efficient to have the leadership of the Board in the same hands as the principal executive officer of the Company. The challenges faced by the Company at this stage &#8211; obtaining financing and performing research and development activities &#8211; are most efficiently dealt with by having one person intimately familiar with both the operational aspects as well as the strategic aspects of the Company&#8217;s business. Second
 Mr. Grossbaum is uniquely suited to fulfill both positions of responsibility because he possesses management experience.





Since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent Directors
 the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our Board of Directors. Thus
 there is a potential conflict of interest in that our Directors have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation
 in essence their own
 and audit issues that may affect management decisions. We are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executives or Directors.



The Board assesses on an ongoing basis the risks faced by the Company. These risks include financial
 technological
 competitive
 and operational risks. The Board dedicates time at each of its meetings to review and consider the relevant risks faced by the Company at that time. In addition
 since the Company does not have an Audit Committee
 the Board is also responsible for the assessment and oversight of the Company&#8217;s financial risk exposures.





We have not paid
 nor do we owe
 any compensation to our executive officers for the year ending December 31
 2013. From inception through December 31
 2013
 we have not paid any compensation to our officers.


As of December 31
 2013
 we had no employment agreements with any of our executive officers or employees.





We do not currently have a stock option plan. No individual grants of stock options
 whether or not in tandem with stock appreciation rights known as SARs or freestanding SARs have been made to any executive officer or any Director since our inception; accordingly
 no stock options have been granted or exercised by any of the officers or Directors since we were founded.




















We do not have any long-term incentive plans that provide compensation intended to serve as incentive for performance. No individual grants or agreements regarding future payouts under non-stock price-based plans have been made to any executive officer or any Director or any employee or consultant since our inception; accordingly
 no future payouts under non-stock price-based plans or agreements have been granted or entered into or exercised by any of the officers or Directors or employees or consultants since we were founded.








Employment Contracts
 Termination of Employment
 Change-in-Control Arrangements


As of December 31
 2013
 there were no employment or other contracts or arrangements with officers or Directors. There are no compensation plans or arrangements
 including payments to be made by us
 with respect to our officers
 Directors or consultants that would result from the resignation
 retirement or any other termination of such Directors
 officers or consultants from us. There are no arrangements for Directors
 officers
 employees or consultants that would result from a change-in-control.








The following table sets forth
 as of February 19
 2014
 certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock by each stockholder known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common stock and by each of our current Directors and executive officers. Each person has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares of common stock
 except as otherwise indicated. Information relating to beneficial ownership of common stock by our principal stockholders and management is based upon information furnished by each person using beneficial ownership concepts under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under these rules
 a person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares voting power
 which includes the power to vote or direct the voting of the security
 or investment power
 which includes the power to vote or direct the disposition of the shares. The person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any security of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days. Under the Securities and Exchange Commission rules
 more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities
 and a person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of securities as to which he or she may not have any pecuniary beneficial interest.


The percentages below are calculated based on 2

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
 AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.

The principal accounting policies
are set out below
 these policies have been consistently applied to the period presented
 unless otherwise stated:

Cash
and cash equivalents
Cash
and equivalents include investments with initial maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its cash balances at
credit-worthy financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#34;FDIC&#34;) up to $250
000.&#160;


Property
Plant and Equipment
The
Company does not own any property
 plant and equipment.

Accounts
payable and accrued expenses
Accounts
payable and accrued expenses are carried at amortized cost and represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company
prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid and arise when the Company becomes obliged to make future payments in respect
of the purchase of these goods and services.

Earnings
per share
The
Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260
 &#34;Earnings Per Share&#34; ASC 260 requires presentation of
both basic and diluted earnings per share (&#147;EPS&#148;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is calculated by
dividing the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders and
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the effects of all potential dilutive common shares
 which comprise
options granted to employees. As at December 31
 2013
 the Company had no potentially dilutive shares.

Income
taxes
Income
taxes are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 740
 &#147;Income Taxes.&#148; Under the asset and liability method
 deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (temporary differences). Deferred tax assets and liabilities

Olivia
Inc is a Delaware company (the &#147;Company&#148;)
 incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on August 02
 2011.
The Company is in the development stage as defined by Accounting Standards Codification 915 (ASC 915)
 &#147;Accounting and reporting
by Development Stage Enterprises&#148;
 the Company is devoting substantially all of its efforts to development of business plans.
The business plan of the Company is to create an online bread club
 which allows members to purchase baked goods and also provide
input and recipes online.

Basis
of Presentation
The
Company maintains its accounting records on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;).

These
financial statements are presented in US dollars.

Fiscal
Year End
The
Corporation has adopted a fiscal year end of December 31.

Going
concern
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates
the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As at December 31
 2013
 the Company
has a loss from operations of $37
910 an accumulated deficit of $38
478 and

 which
may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures
 working capital and other cash requirements for the year ending December
31
 2014.

The
ability of the Company to emerge from the development stage is dependent upon
 among other things
 obtaining additional financing
to continue operations
 and development of its business plan. In response to these problems
 management intends to raise additional
funds through public or private placement offerings.

These
factors
 among others
 raise substantial doubt about the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts or revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

In
September 2006
 the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 &#147;Fair Value Measurements&#148;. The objective of SFAS 157 (ASC 820) is to
increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and to expand disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS
157 (ASC 820) defines fair value
 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 (ASC 820) applies under other accounting pronouncements that require
or permit fair value measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements.

The
Company has various financial instruments that must be measured under the new fair value standard including: cash in bank. The
Company currently does not have non-financial assets or non-financial liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value
on a recurring basis. The Company&#146;s financial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from the three levels of
the fair value hierarchy. The three levels are as follows:



    
Quoted prices in active markets
    for identical instruments;

    
Other significant observable inputs (including
    quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments);

    
Significant unobservable inputs (including
    assumptions in determining the fair value of certain investments).




    

Financial
assets and liabilities carried at fair value and measured on a recurring basis are classified in the hierarchy as follows:

In
July 2013
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;)
No. 2013-11: Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward
 a Similar Tax Loss
 or a Tax
Credit Carryforward Exists. The new guidance requires that unrecognized tax benefits be presented on a net basis with the deferred
tax assets for such carryforwards. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning
after December 15
 2013. We do not expect the adoption of the new provisions to have a material impact on our financial condition
or results of operations.






        
          

        
          
            

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    








        
          

        
          
            
                
              
                
              

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    

                  
                    
                    





















    
  
      

          

        

      






        
        


        
        
The
Company maintains its accounting records on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;).

These
financial statements are presented in US dollars.



        
        
The
Corporation has adopted a fiscal year end of December 31.



        
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates
the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As at December 31
 2013
 the Company
has a loss from operations of $37
910 an accumulated deficit of $38
478 and has earned no revenues since inception. The Company
intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements
 which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures
working capital and other cash requirements for the year ending December 31
 2014.

The
ability of the Company to emerge from the development stage is dependent upon
 among other things
 obtaining additional financing
to continue operations
 and development of its business plan. In response to these problems
 management intends to raise additional
funds through public or private placement offerings.

These
factors
 among others
 raise substantial doubt about the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.


        
        
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts or revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.




        
        
Cash
and equivalents include investments with initial maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its cash balances at
credit-worthy financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#34;FDIC&#34;) up to $250
000.&#160;




Property
 plant and equipment
        
The
Company does not own any property
 plant and equipment.



        
        
Accounts
payable and accrued expenses are carried at amortized cost and represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company
prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid and arise when the Company becomes obliged to make future payments in respect
of the purchase of these goods and services.



        
        
The
Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260
 &#34;Earnings Per Share&#34; ASC 260 requires presentation of
both basic and diluted earnings per share (&#147;EPS&#148;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is calculated by
dividing the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders and
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the effects of all potential dilutive common shares
 which comprise
options granted to employees. As at December 31
 2013
 the Company had no potentially dilutive shares.



        
        
Income
taxes are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 740
 &#147;Income Taxes.&#148; Under the asset and liability method
 deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (temporary differences). Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered
or settled. Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that some portion or
all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

 (b) the possible effects of such conditions and events
 (c) management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions and events and any mitigating factors
 (d) possible discontinuance of operations
 (e) management's plans (including relevant prospective financial information)
 and (f) information about the recoverability or classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts or classification of liabilities. If management's plans alleviate the substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern
 disclosure of the principal conditions and events that initially raised the substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern would be expected to be considered. Disclose whether operations for the current or prior years generated sufficient cash to cover current obligations
 whether waivers were obtained from creditors relating to the company's default under the provisions of debt agreements and possible effects of such conditions and events
 such as: whether there is a possible need to obtain additional financing (debt or equity) or to liquidate certain holdings to offset future cash flow deficiencies. Disclose appropriate parent company information when parent is dependent upon remittances from subsidiaries to satisfy its obligations.
