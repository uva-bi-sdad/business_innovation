In this Annual Report
 unless otherwise specified
 all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to common stock refer to the shares of our common stock.


As used in this Annual Report
 the terms we, us, our, Aquino, and &#8220;Issuer&#8221; mean Aquino Milling Inc. unless the context clearly requires otherwise.


























We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 14
 2011. We purchased rice milling equipment
 and expected to commence our rice milling operations in September
 2012. The Company issued 1
000
000 shares of its common stock to its President (100
000 shares) and Secretary (900
000 shares) at inception in exchange for $18
000. We are a development stage company and have limited financial resources. We have not established or attempted to establish a source of equity or debt financing. Our auditors indicated in their Report on our Financial Statements that &#8220;the Company has not established a source of revenue or financing
 which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.&#8221;





The principal services that we will provide will be rice milling services for local farmers in Gerona
 Philippines.





Our rice milling facility was located on a suitable plot of land
 in Pinasling Gerona
 Tarlac in the Philippines.

Gerona is a 2nd class municipality in the province of Tarlac
 Philippines. It has a population of 72
618 people in 15
769 households. Gerona has a land area of 141.47 square kilometers of plain and rugged agricultural land representing 4.63% of the province total area. The Tarlac River
 which originates from the eastern slopes of the Zambales Mountain
 cuts across the west central areas
 dividing the town into two parts. It is characterized as plain
 low-lying agricultural land.





We built a rice milling factory in Gerona Tarlac to service the local rice farmers. Rice will be cleaned
 and de-husked from brown rice to produce white rice and sold for local consumption. Based on our research
 the rice would have to be logistically picked up from local farmers who currently farm and sell their rice on a cash basis to local traders for 850 pesos = $20 unmilled rice per 50kg bag. This price is usually fixed by the government although local traders who carry cash in hand
 negotiate better deals with the rice farmers. Our services for rice milling would have been charged at about 65 pesos=$1.53 per 50kg bag of milled rice.












We negotiated with local taxi drivers to deliver the rice and the farmer to our facility in Gerona Tarlac
 each taxi would paid $.23 per 50kg bag.

We compete with local traders who visit the farmers residence and offer them cash in hand in exchange for their unmilled rice. In addition
 there are two private companies that provide rice milling services in the area in which we intend to provide our services. As of now there are two local rice mills in Gerona Tarlac. The current and potential competitors have and can devote substantially greater resources to rice milling than we can. In addition
 we cannot provide any assurance that another rice milling facility will not successfully offer a competitive rice milling service. We believe it is likely that there will be additional entrants to the rice milling market in Gerona. These competitors will compete against us for the contracts with rice farmers. This competition could cause us to enter into rice milling agreements with less favorable terms or lose potential rice farmers who could use our services.


We intended to compete by offering the farmers to mill rice in our facility and thereby allow them to make a higher profit on their harvest. We expected to charge a fixed fee for our services
 allowing them the full benefit of selling their white milled rice a full market value. We expected to be a local rice milling facility
 therefore all the farmers in our target area will be able to come and visit our facility. We expected to compete on service. However
 we cannot predict the likelihood or timing for our success. No assurances can be given that our competitive strategy will have any success.

























As of December 31
 2012
 we had no employees but our President has provided services at no cost to the Company. During 2012
 our President
 Mr. Aquino devoted at least thirty hours a week to us.&#160;&#160;As to the future
 there is no written employment contract or agreement with our President and we will also use independent contractors and consultants to assist in many aspects of our business on an as-needed basis pending financial resources that become available to us.





Our operational office is Mauplas
 Pinasling

 Philippines 2312. This space is provided to us free of charge by our President. There is no written lease agreement. Our executive office and mailing address is 10685-B Hazelhurst Dr. #13025

To our knowledge
 we are not a party to any current
 pending
 or threatened litigation of any type.




In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 stockholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors:


















We are an early stage company and have extremely limited financial resources. We have working capital of $4
204 and stockholders&#8217; equity of $ 531 at December 31
 2012. Our independent registered auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their opinion on our financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31
 2012 that states that this lack of resources causes substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. No assurances can be given that we will generate sufficient revenue or obtain necessary financing to continue as a going concern.









Because we have only recently commenced business operations and suffered a near total loss of our milling facility in a weather related event
 we face a high risk of business failure.




We were formed in November 2011. All of our efforts to date have related to developing our business plan and building our mill which was wiped out as a result of Typhoon Soala in the summer of 2012.&#160;&#160;Through December 31
 2012
 we had substantially no operating revenues. We face a high risk of business failure.

























Most of our competitors
 which include well known rice milling facilities
 have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than do we.




Most of our competitors
 which include government owned milling facilities in the Philippines
 have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than do we. Many private milling facilities have been in business for several years and have the credibility and have the ability to advertise in a wide variety of media
 including television. We will principally depend on the business contacts of our President and word of mouth. There are no assurances that our approach will be successful.










AMI is and will continue to be completely dependent on the services of our founder and President
 Louie Aquino
 the loss of whose services may cause our business operations to cease
 and we will need to engage and retain qualified employees and consultants to further implement our strategy.




AMI&#8217;s operations and business strategy are completely dependent upon the knowledge and business connections of Mr. Aquino. He is under no contractual obligation to remain employed by us. If he should choose to leave us for any reason or if he becomes ill and is unable to work for an extended period of time before we have hired additional personnel
 our operations will likely fail. Even if we are able to find additional personnel
 it is uncertain whether we could find someone who could develop our business along the lines described in this prospectus. We will fail without the services of Mr. Aquino or an appropriate replacement(s).


We intend to acquire key-man life insurance on the life of Mr. Aquino naming us as the beneficiary when and if we obtain the resources to do so and if he is insurable. We have not yet procured such insurance
 and there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain such insurance in the future. Accordingly
 it is important that we are able to attract
 motivate and retain highly qualified and talented personnel and independent contractors.















Our financial prospects will be significantly dependent upon our rice milling related services. Rice milling services is dependent on rice consumption spending levels. As a result
 sales of white rice tend to decline during general economic downturns and recessions. Accordingly
 the current economic recession in the Philippines has led to a weakening in the fundamental demand for our services. In addition
 unforeseen events beyond our control
 such as the imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities towards rice milling related services and products
 also may adversely affect our business and results of operations.















Our revenues and operating results are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter because our industry experiences seasonal fluctuations
 due to rice harvest times and interest for rice milling related services offered by us.

There are two rice harvests per year
 hence we anticipate we will have a steady flow of business from September &#8211; December and from March &#8211; May.

Because of these fluctuations and uncertainties
 our operating results may fail to meet the expectations of investors. If this happens
 the trading price of our common stock would almost certainly be materially adversely affected.





























Following the effective date of our registration statement of which this prospectus is a part
 we will be required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. In order to comply with these requirements
 our independent registered public accounting firm will have to review our financial statements on a quarterly basis and audit our financial statements on an annual basis. Moreover
 our legal counsel will have to review and assist in the preparation of such reports. The costs charged by these professionals for such services cannot be accurately predicted at this time because factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports cannot be determined at this time and will have a major affect on the amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys. However
 the incurrence of such costs will obviously be an expense to our operations and thus have a negative effect on our ability to meet our overhead requirements and earn a profit. We may be exposed to potential risks resulting from any new requirements under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud
 our business and operating results could be harmed
 investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information
 and the trading price of our common stock
 if a market ever develops
 could drop significantly.










Our internal controls may be inadequate
 which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated to the public.




Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)
 internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by
 or under the supervision of
 the principal executive and principal financial officer and effected by the Board of Directors
 management and other personnel
 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:





&#183; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
 and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and/or Directors of the Company; and


&#183; provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


Our internal controls may be inadequate or ineffective
 which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated to the public. Investors relying upon this misinformation may make an uninformed investment decision.















As a public company
 we will have to comply with numerous financial reporting and legal requirements
 including those pertaining to audits and internal control. The costs of this compliance could be significant. If our revenues are insufficient
 and/or we cannot satisfy many of these costs through the issuance of our shares
 we may be unable to satisfy these costs in the normal course of business which would result in our being unable to continue as a going concern.





























We have only two Directors. Accordingly
 we cannot establish board committees comprised of independent members to oversee functions like compensation or audit issues. Until we have a larger board of Directors that would include some independent members
 if ever
 there will be limited oversight of our officers decisions and activities and little ability for minority shareholders to challenge or reverse those activities and decisions
 even if they are not in the best interests of minority shareholders.



















We have no committed source of financing. Wherever possible
 our Board of Directors will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances
 we believe that the non-cash consideration will consist of restricted shares of our common stock. Our Board of Directors has authority
 without action or vote of the shareholders
 to issue all or part of the authorized (120
000
000 shares). In addition
 if a trading market develops for our common stock
 we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock
 possibly at a discount to the then-prevailing market. These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders may further dilute common stock book value
 and that dilution may be material.















Our Board of Directors has authority
 without action or vote of the shareholders
 to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued common shares. Such issuances may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management and the interests of existing management which may not be the same as the interests of other shareholders. Our ability to issue shares without shareholder approval serves to enhance existing management&#8217;s ability to maintain control of our Company.














Our bylaws provide for indemnification of Directors and Officers of the Company. We have been advised that
 in the opinion of the SEC
 indemnification for liabilities arising under federal securities laws is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is
 therefore
 unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification for liabilities arising under federal securities laws
 other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by a Director
 officer or controlling person in the successful defense of any action
 suit or proceeding
 is asserted by a Director
 officer or controlling person in connection with our activities
 we will (unless in the opinion of our counsel
 the matter has been settled by controlling precedent) submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction
 the question whether indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. The legal process relating to this matter if it were to occur is likely to be very costly and may result in us receiving negative publicity
 either of which factors is likely to materially reduce the market and price for our shares
 if such a market ever develops.
















We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. The future payment of dividends directly depends upon our future earnings
 capital requirements
 financial requirements and other factors that our board of Directors will consider. Since we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock
 return on your investment
 if any
 will depend solely on an increase
 if any
 in the market value of our common stock.

























Because we are not subject to compliance with rules requiring the adoption of certain corporate governance measures
 our stockholders have limited protection against interested Director transactions
 conflicts of interest and similar matters.





The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 as well as rule changes proposed and enacted by the SEC
 the New York and American Stock Exchanges and the Nasdaq Stock Market (as a result of Sarbanes-Oxley)
 require the implementation of various measures relating to corporate governance. These measures are designed to enhance the integrity of corporate management and the securities markets and apply to securities that are listed on those exchanges or the Nasdaq Stock Market. Because we are not presently required to comply with many of the corporate governance provisions and because we chose to avoid incurring the substantial additional costs associated with such compliance any sooner than legally required
 we have not yet adopted these measures.


Because our Directors are not independent Directors
 we do not currently have independent audit or compensation committees. As a result
 these Directors have the ability
 among other things
 to determine their own level of compensation. Until we comply with such corporate governance measures
 regardless of whether such compliance is required
 the absence of such standards of corporate governance may leave our stockholders without protections against interested Director transactions
 conflicts of interest
 if any
 and similar matters and investors may be reluctant to provide us with funds necessary to expand our operations.


We intend to comply with all corporate governance measures relating to Director independence as and when required. However
 we may find it very difficult or be unable to attract and retain qualified Officers
 Directors and members of board committees required to provide for our effective management as a result of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has resulted in a series of rules and regulations by the SEC that increase responsibilities and liabilities of Directors and executive officers. The perceived increased personal risk associated with these recent changes may make it more costly or deter qualified individuals from accepting these roles.















As of the effective date of our registration statement of which this prospectus is a part
 we will become subject to certain informational requirements of the Exchange Act
 as amended
 and we will be required to file periodic reports (i.e.
 annual
 quarterly and special reports) with the SEC which will be immediately available to the public for inspection and copying. Except during the year that our registration statement becomes effective
 these reporting obligations may (in our sole discretion) be automatically suspended under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act if we have less than 310 shareholders and do not file a registration statement on Form 8A (of which we have no current plans to file). If this occurs after the year in which our registration statement becomes effective
 we will no longer be obligated to file periodic reports with the SEC and your access to our business information would then be even more restricted. After this registration statement on Form S-1 becomes effective
 we may be required to deliver periodic reports to security holders. However
 we will not be required to furnish proxy statements to security holders and our Directors
 officers and principal beneficial owners will not be required to report their beneficial ownership of securities to the SEC pursuant to Section 16 of the Exchange Act until we have both 500 or more security holders and greater than $10 million in assets. This means that your access to information regarding our business will be limited.

ITEM 5.&#160;&#160;MARKET FOR REGISTRANT&#8217;S COMMON EQUITY
 RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES








There is currently no market for our shares. We cannot give you any assurance that the shares will ever have a market or that if a market for our shares ever develops
 that you will be able to sell your shares. In addition
 even if a public market for our shares develops
 there is no assurance that a secondary public market will be sustained.


The shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol OTC BB &#8220;AQOC&#8221;
 but no active trading market has developed and we cannot assure you that an active trading market will ever develop.





As of January 31
 2013
 we had outstanding 1
200
000 shares of common stock
 which were held by 42 non-affiliated stockholders of record and 2 affiliated stockholders of records.




















Since our inception
 we have not declared nor paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.&#160;&#160;Our current policy is to retain any earnings in order to finance our operations.&#160;&#160;Our Board of Directors will determine future declarations and payments of dividends
 if any
 in light of the then-current conditions it deems relevant and in accordance with applicable corporate law.











During the fiscal year ended December 31
 2012
 except as included in our Registration Statement that went effective on March 26
 2012
 we have not sold any equity securities not registered under the Securities Act.




During each month within the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 30
 2012
 neither we nor any &#8220;affiliated purchaser
&#8221; as that term is defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act
 repurchased any of our common stock or other securities.













We were incorporated on November 14
 2011. Our business activity through December 31
 2011 involved incorporation efforts
 planning and research of (i) potential clients in the Gerona area and (ii) cost evaluation for acquiring rice milling machines
 as well as preparation of this Offering
 whose Registration Statement was declared effective on March 26
 2012.


In 2012
 we incurred costs to research the market
quarter of 2012. Unfortunately
 at the end of July/early August 2012 Typhoon Soala flooded most of the Phillipines and especially Tarlac and destroyed our milling facility resulting in a total loss of our equipment .At the time we had not yet earned any revenue from rice milling activities as this was the beginning of the rice season. All rice crops were destroyed. Our mill was under two meters of water for an extended period of time
 causing electrical and rust damage to our mill. We are currently in the process of attempting to fix the electrical and generator components of the mill but we will not have sufficient funds to acquire a new mill.

















As a result of our losses
 we have determined that we will seek additional funding and/or a new line of operations.





If we decide to raise additional funding
 our plan to continue as a going concern is to reach the point where we begin generating sufficient revenue from our rice milling services to meet all of our obligations on a timely basis. In the early stages of our operations we intend to keep costs to a minimum.


If we are successful in our additional fundraising activities
 then in second half of 2013 we will purchase a rice mill
 rebuild our warehouse and continue to operate according to our original business plan.








For the three and twelve month period ended December 31
 2012
 we had no revenues. The period ended December 31
 2011 is measured from inception
 which was November 14
 2011 and we had no revenue.


Total expenses for the twelve month period ended December 31
 2012 was $38
845
 and an extraordinary loss of $13
000 as a result of Typoon Soala in July/August 2012 resulting in a net loss of $43
865. and total expenses since inception (November 14
 2011) were $40
449 resulting in a cumulative net loss since inception of $45
469.





We estimate that we will require at least $25
000 for the next 12 months of operations including acquiring a new mill and rebuilding our warehouse facility
 finalizing our facility and running the milling to during the harvest season. As of December 31
 2012
 we had $4
204 available in cash.





Since incorporation
 most of our resources and work was devoted to planning our business
 implementing systems and controls
 completing our registration statement
 buying the mill and constructing our warehouse. We had begun introductory marketing to attract farmers to use our rice milling facilities. We expected to commence milling activity in the next harvest starting September 2012. We did not so commence as a result of Typhoon Soala.



































In May 2012 we raised $28
000 pursuant to our offering.










In June we finalized the acquisition of the rice milling machine and began installation in our newly constructed warehouse
 we also plan on negotiating fixed prices for logistics/transportation with independent taxis in the town of Gerona.



























We became a public company and
 by doing so
 have incurred and will continue to incur additional significant expenses for legal
 accounting and related services.&#160;&#160;We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act of '34
 we will incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting
 legal and a host of other expenses including annual reports and proxy statements
 if required. We estimate that these costs will range up to $50
000 per year for the next few years and will be higher if our business volume and activity increases but lower during the first year of being public because our overall business volume will be lower
 and we will not yet be subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 until we exceed $75 million in market capitalization.


These obligations will reduce our ability and resources to expand our business. We hope to be able to use our status as a public company to increase our ability to use non-cash means of settling obligations and compensate independent contractors who provide professional services to us
 although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of those efforts. We will reduce the compensation levels paid to management if there is insufficient cash generated from operations to satisfy these costs.


As of December 31
 2012
 we owed $188 in connection with organizational costs which may be converted into an interest-free demand loan from our President. The proceeds were used for basic working capital purposes. Recently
 our President provided a loan to the Company of $8
000 which mostly was used to attempt to fix our facility and milling machine.





The preparation of financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments
 estimates
 and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
 liabilities
 revenue and expenses
 and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.


An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made
 and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used
 or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically
 could materially impact the financial statements.


Financial Reporting Release No. 60 requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements. There are no critical policies or decisions that rely on judgments that are based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Note 2 to the financial statements
 included elsewhere in this prospectus
 includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements.





There is a seasonal trend in our business. There are generally two rice harvests per year. September-December and March-May. Initially
 our income and activity will be heavily based on those two three month periods. If we rebuild
 we will target to be operational for the March-May harvest.




We have no off-balance sheet arrangements
 as defined in Item 313(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K
 or obligations under any guarantee contracts or contingent obligations. We also have no other commitments
 other than the costs of being a public company that will increase our operating costs or cash requirements in the future.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Aquino Milling Inc. (a Delaware corporation in the development stage) as of December 31
 2012 and 2011 and the related statements of operations
 stockholders&#8217; equity
 and cash flows for the years ended December 31
 2012 and 2011 and cumulative from inception (November14
 2011). These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion
 the financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of Aquino Milling Inc. as of December 31
 2012 and 2011 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31
 2012 and 2011
 and cumulative from inception (November14
 2011) in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements
 the Company is in the development stage
 and has incurred an operating loss since inception. Further
 as of December 31
 2012
 the cash resources of the Company were insufficient to meet its planned business objectives. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. Management&#8217;s plan regarding these matters is also described in Note 2 to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Aquino Milling Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is in the development stage
 and has limited operations. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 14
 2011. The business plan of the Company is to build and maintain a rice mill in the Philippines.








For purposes of reporting within the statement of cash flows
 the Company considers all cash on hand
 cash accounts not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties
 and all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.





The Company recognizes revenues when delivery of goods or completion of services has occurred provided there is persuasive evidence of an agreement
 acceptance has been approved by its customers
 the fee is fixed or determinable based on the completion of stated terms and conditions
 and collection of any related receivable is probable.





Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to the common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Fully diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. There were no dilutive financial instruments issued or outstanding for the period ended December 31
 2012.











Changes in circumstances
 such as the Company generating taxable income
 could cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset. Any change in the valuation allowance will be included in income in the year of the change in estimate.



















Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820 &#8220;Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures&#8221; (ASC 820) defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1)&#160;market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2)&#160;a reporting entity&#8217;s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels
 which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:


Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical
 unrestricted assets or liabilities.

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability
 either directly or indirectly
 including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g.
 interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.





The Company estimates the fair value of financial instruments using the available market information and valuation methods. Considerable judgment is required in estimating fair value. Accordingly
 the estimates of fair value may not be indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. As of December 31
 2012 and 2011
 the carrying value of accounts payable and accrued liabilities
 and loans from related parties approximated fair value due to the short-term nature and maturity of these instruments.





The Company defers as other assets the direct incremental costs of raising capital until such time as the offering is completed. At the time of the completion of the offering
 the costs are charged against the capital raised. Should the offering be terminated
 deferred offering costs are charged to operations during the period in which the offering is terminated.





The Company considers incremental costs and expenses related to the registration of equity securities with the SEC
 whether by contractual arrangement as of a certain date or by demand
 to be unrelated to original issuance transactions. As such
 subsequent registration costs and expenses are reflected in the accompanying financial statements as general and administrative expenses
 and are expensed as incurred.





All non cancellable leases with an initial term greater than one year are categorized as either capital leases or operating leases. Assets recorded under capital leases are amortized according to the methods employed for property and equipment or over the term of the related lease
 if shorter.




















The financial statements are prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
 liabilities and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.





The Company is currently in the development stage
 and has limited operations. The business plan of the Company is to build and maintain a rice mill in the Philippines.


The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
 which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has incurred an operating loss since inception. Further
 as of December 31
 2012 the cash resources of the Company were insufficient to meet its current business plan. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.





As of December 31
 2012 fixed assets were comprised of a rice mill located in the Philippines. As of December 31
 2012 the rice mill was not placed in service.





On November 21
 2011
 the Company issued 1
000
000 shares of common stock to the directors of the Company at a price of $0.018 per share
 for $18
000 subscription receivable. Payments of the subscriptions were received by December 31
 2011.


The Company has commenced a capital formation activity by filing a Registration Statement on Form S-1 to the SEC to register and sell in a self-directed offering 500
000 shares of newly issued common stock at an offering price of $0.20 per share for proceeds of up to $100
000. As of May 10
 2012
 the Company had received $40
000 in proceeds. The Company offset the proceeds by $12
000 of legal and audit offering costs related to this capital formation activity.





The provision (benefit) for income taxes for the periods ended December 31
 2012 and 2012 were as follows (assuming a 15% effective tax rate):

The Company provided a valuation allowance equal to the deferred income tax assets for periods ended December 31
 2012 and December 31
 2011 because it is not presently known whether future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize the loss carryforwards.


As of December 31
 2012
 the Company had approximately $45
469 in tax loss carryforwards that can be utilized future periods to reduce taxable income
 and expire by the year 2032.

 generally for three years after they are filed.



On November 21
 2011
 the Company issued 1
000
000 shares of common stock to the directors of the Company at a price of $0.018 per share
 for $18
000 subscription receivable. Payments of the subscriptions were received by December 31
 2011.


As of December 31
 2012
 loans from related parties amounted to $188 and represented working capital advances from Directors who are also stockholders of the Company. The loans are unsecured
 non-interest bearing
 and due on demand.&#160;























In May 2011
 the FASB issued ASU 2011-04
 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). Under ASU 2011-04
 the guidance amends certain accounting and disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements to ensure that fair value has the same meaning in U.S. GAAP and in IFRS and that their respective fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are the same. ASU 2011-04 is effective for public entities during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15
 2011. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company does not believe that the adoption of ASU 2011-04 will have a material impact on the Company's results of operation and financial condition.

In June 2011
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05
 Comprehensive Income (ASC Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income, (ASU 2011-05) which amends current comprehensive income guidance. This accounting update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders' equity. Instead
 comprehensive income must be reported in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two sections
 net income and other comprehensive income
 or in two separate but consecutive statements. ASU 2011-05 will be effective for public companies during the interim and annual periods beginning after Dec. 15
 2011 with early adoption permitted. The Company does not believe that the adoption of ASU 2011-05 will have a material impact on the Company's results of operation and financial condition.

There were various other updates recently issued
 most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries.&#160;&#160;None of the updates are expected to a have a material impact on the Company's financial position
 results of operations or cash flows.





As a result of a flood on August 9
 2012 a rice mill in the Philippines was written off as a total loss. The loss per share attributable to the loss was $(0.01).


























Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s rules and forms.&#160;&#160;Disclosure controls and procedures include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer&#8217;s management
 including the principal executive and principal financial officer
 or persons performing similar functions
 as appropriate
 to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.&#160;&#160;Any controls and procedures
 no matter how well designed and operated
 can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.

We have carried out an evaluation
 under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
 as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report.


Based on that evaluation
 our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.




Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
 as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).&#160;&#160;Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.&#160;&#160;This annual report does not include a report of management's assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting due to a transition period established by rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission for newly public companies.





There were no significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our fourth fiscal quarter
 that could materially affect
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

 or removal.

The following is a brief account of the education and business experience of our directors and executive officers during at least the past five years
 indicating their principal occupations and employment during the period
 and the name and principal business of the organization in which such occupations or employment were carried on.


Louie P. Aquino
 President
 Chief Executive Officer
 Chief Financial Officer
 Treasurer
 and Director


Mr. Louie P. Aquino is self employed since September 2011 and currently acts as a buyer and seller of unmilled rice in the Tarlac Province. Between 2007-2011 Mr. Aquino was a self employed private caregiver to geriatric individuals where he was responsible for all aspects of their day to day care. Mr. Aquino completed a seminar in the Philippines to qualify as a caregiver in 2005. In 2004 Mr. Aquino worked part time in the government offices in the computer department in Tarlac. In 2003-2004 Mr. Aquino received a technical degree in Computer Science from the AMA Computer College in Tarlac
 Philippines. Mr. Aquino has a lifetime of experience in rice farming in the Philippines as this is his family&#8217;s business.


Daniel Hochester
 Secretary and Director


Mr. Daniel Hochster is the co-owner of Chesed for Alafim a Hong Kong clothing design and manufacturing company which sells under the brands LEON
 DNH and BANDC. Chesed for Alafim seeks to sell quality clothing at a low price point and therefore it manufactures in the Far&#8211;East. It sells its goods to wholesalers in the United Kingdom and USA. Since 2007 to present Mr. Hochster has been the acting president of the company where he is responsible for day to day operations. His organizational skills
 negotiation skills on lowering costs
 his experience working in the Far East
 his marketing skills will assist Aquino Milling and help grow the business.



















We do not presently have a separately constituted audit committee
 compensation committee
 nominating committee
 executive committee or any other committees of our Board of Directors. As such
 our entire Board of Directors acts as our audit committee.





Our Board of Directors does not currently have any member who qualifies as an audit committee financial expert. We believe that the cost related to retaining such a financial expert at this time is prohibitive. Further
 because we are in the start-up stage of our business operations
 we believe the services of an audit committee financial expert are not warranted at this time.





None of our Directors
 nominee for Directors
 or officers has appeared as a party during the past ten years in any legal proceedings that may bear on his ability or integrity to serve as a Director or officer of the Company.





The Company has chosen to combine the principal executive officer and Board chairman positions. The Company believes that this Board leadership structure is the most appropriate for the Company for the following reasons. First
 the Company is a development stage company and at this early stage it is more efficient to have the leadership of the Board in the same hands as the principal executive officer of the Company. The challenges faced by the Company at this stage &#8211; obtaining financing and performing research and development activities &#8211; are most efficiently dealt with by having one person intimately familiar with both the operational aspects as well as the strategic aspects of the Company&#8217;s business. Second
 Mr. Aquino is uniquely suited to fulfill both positions of responsibility because he possesses management experience
 technical experience
 and experience with start-up companies.





Since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent Directors
 the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our Board of Directors. Thus
 there is a potential conflict of interest in that our Directors have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation
 in essence their own
 and audit issues that may affect management decisions. We are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executives or Directors.



The Board assesses on an ongoing basis the risks faced by the Company. These risks include financial
 technological
 competitive
 and operational risks. The Board dedicates time at each of its meetings to review and consider the relevant risks faced by the Company at that time. In addition
 since the Company does not have an Audit Committee
 the Board is also responsible for the assessment and oversight of the Company&#8217;s financial risk exposures.




















We have not paid
 nor do we owe
 any compensation to our executive officers for the year ending December 31
 2012. From inception through December 31
 2012
 we have not paid any compensation to our officers.


As of December 31
 2012
 we had no employment agreements with any of our executive officers or employees.





We do not currently have a stock option plan. No individual grants of stock options
 whether or not in tandem with stock appreciation rights known as SARs or freestanding SARs have been made to any executive officer or any Director since our inception; accordingly
 no stock options have been granted or exercised by any of the officers or Directors since we were founded.





We do not have any long-term incentive plans that provide compensation intended to serve as incentive for performance. No individual grants or agreements regarding future payouts under non-stock price-based plans have been made to any executive officer or any Director or any employee or consultant since our inception; accordingly
 no future payouts under non-stock price-based plans or agreements have been granted or entered into or exercised by any of the officers or Directors or employees or consultants since we were founded.








Employment Contracts
 Termination of Employment
 Change-in-Control Arrangements


As of December 31
 2012
 there were no employment or other contracts or arrangements with officers or Directors. There are no compensation plans or arrangements
 including payments to be made by us
 with respect to our officers
 Directors or consultants that would result from the resignation
 retirement or any other termination of such Directors
 officers or consultants from us. There are no arrangements for Directors
 officers
 employees or consultants that would result from a change-in-control.























The following table sets forth
 as of January 31
 2013
 certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock by each stockholder known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common stock and by each of our current Directors and executive officers. Each person has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares of common stock
 except as otherwise indicated. Information relating to beneficial ownership of common stock by our principal stockholders and management is based upon information furnished by each person using beneficial ownership concepts under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under these rules
 a person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares voting power
 which includes the power to vote or direct the voting of the security
 or investment power
 which includes the power to vote or direct the disposition of the shares. The person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any security of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days. Under the Securities and Exchange Commission rules
 more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities
 and a person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of securities as to which he or she may not have any pecuniary beneficial interest.


The percentages below are calculated based on 1
200
000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of January 28
 2013. We do not have any outstanding options
 warrants or other securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of our common stock.

ITEM 13.&#160; CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
 AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.


Except as disclosed below
 since the beginning of the fiscal year preceding the last fiscal year none of the following persons has had any direct or indirect material interest in any transaction to which our Company was or is a party
 or in any proposed transaction to which our Company proposes to be a party:



































any person who beneficially owns
 directly or indirectly
 shares carrying more than 5 percent of the voting rights attached to our common stock; or












any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons (including a spouse
 parents
 children
 siblings
 and in-laws).





On November 21
 2011
 the Company issued 1
000
000 shares of common stock to the directors of the Company at a price of $0.018 per share
 for $18
000 subscription receivable. Payments of the subscriptions were received by December 31
 2011.







We are not subject to listing requirements of any national securities exchange or national securities association and
 as a result
 we are not at this time required to have our board comprised of a majority of &#8220;independent Directors.&#8221; We do not believe that either of our directors currently meets the definition of &#8220;independent&#8221; as promulgated by the rules and regulations of NASDAQ.

For the year ended December 31
 2012
 principal accountants of the Company were Weinberg &amp; Baer LLC.




Since incorporation and as of the fiscal year ended December 31
 2012
 there were no fees billed for assurance and related services by the principal accountant that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under Item 9(e)(1) of Schedule 14A
 for professional services rendered by the principal account for tax compliance
 tax advice
 and tax planning
 for products and services provided by the principal accountant
 other than the services reported in Item 9(e)(1) through 9(d)(3) of Schedule 14A.



Given the small size of our Board as well as the limited activities of our Company
 our Board of Directors acts as our Audit Committee.&#160;&#160;Our Board pre-approves all audit and permissible non-audit services.&#160;&#160;These services may include audit services
 audit-related services
 tax services
 and other services.&#160;&#160;Our Board approves these services on a case-by-case basis.
