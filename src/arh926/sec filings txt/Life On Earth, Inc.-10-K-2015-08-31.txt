 Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;
or &ldquo;HISP&rdquo;) was incorporated on April 15
 2013 and is a Delaware company that is dedicated to building one of the premier
companies distributing ethnic inspired food and beverages throughout the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;HISP has already begun to distribute
fruit juices
 nectars
 and milk based products and intends to distribute teas
 carbonated drinks
 dry goods
 preserves
 and bakery
products. These brands emulate the flavors
 tastes
 and traditions which have been known for generations among the Hispanic and
other ethnic groups which are now becoming part of the American mainstream diet. The brands distributed are under a proprietary
basis (through distribution agreements and/or exclusive licensing arrangements). In October 2013
 the Company signed a distribution
agreement with Gran Nevada Beverage
 Inc. (&ldquo;Gran Nevada&rdquo;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&ldquo;GN&rdquo;)
 an entity related through
common management. The agreement provides the Company with the right to sell and distribute Gran Nevada's beverages in Texas and
California with purchase prices at the then applicable wholesale prices charged to Gran Nevada's distributors. The agreement is
for an initial term of five years with automatic renewals of successive five year terms unless terminated.&nbsp;HISP initiated
sales and distribution operations in March 2014.

and ethnic-neutral consumers.

Nevada is the sole manufacturer for its product line
 and there are no alternate suppliers in the event that Gran Nevada or its
suppliers are unable or unwilling to provide HISP with the products needed to meet demand.


 Gran Nevada had eight (8) SKUs that are manufactured
in North America. Gran Nevada intends to expand to 13 SKUs by adding five new product lines of popular existing flavors in larger
formats. HISP currently sells 70% of its products through distributors to grocery stores
 which want larger containers for home
consumption and food service markets rather than just the current eight single serve products. YaYa Foods will package the Horchata
de Morro and Mexican Horchata 1 liter Tetra Pack cartons. Mrs. Clark's has been selected to bottle GN&rsquo;s Tamarind
 Mango &amp;

of the country. The Company also intends to sell directly to retailers
 including large chain stores. Direct to retail

 which results in higher gross margins for retailers.

the Company expects to have a portfolio of products that will not only include beverages. The main competitors of the Company include
Goya Foods
 Marquez Brothers International
 Diaz Foods
 La Fe Foods International
 Grace Foods
 as well as other regional Ethnic
Food Distributors. HISP will focus&nbsp;on selecting brands of all natural packaged foods. Although some competitors are selling
and distributing similar products
 they use different packaging options and in particular market foods that have high contents
of artificial flavors
 colors
 and sweeteners as well high sodium contents. Additionally
 our competitors import the majority of
their distributed products
 which are made with lower quality and price point raw materials. HISP will focus on distributing all
natural products as well as obtaining exclusive rights to brands that can be manufactured closer to its U.S. market base.&nbsp;HISP
is committed to building long-term relationships with its consumers by offering superior
 high quality products at the most competitive
prices.

beverage market is generally dominated by the largest beverage providers
 including The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo
 Inc.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many
of our competitors enjoy significant brand recognition and consumer confidence and are able to readily secure shelf space and media
attention for their products.&nbsp;Many of our competitors also have existing relationships with the same distribution channels
and retailers through which we sell our products.&nbsp;We intend to compete in the market by offering consumers affordable products
that taste better and possess a longer shelf life than most products in the market.

 the Company had no full-time
employees.&nbsp;Personnel are independent contractors or insider owners who do not receive cash compensation but may receive
stock compensation. The Company mitigates the need for a production staff by purchasing finished inventory.&nbsp;The Company
has contracted with food brokers to represent Gran Nevada&reg; to retail stores nationally.&nbsp;In certain regions of the
United States
 we utilize the services of direct sales and distribution companies
 which sell our products through their
distribution channels.&nbsp;This can mitigate the need for a large sales and merchandising force.&nbsp;The Company also
outsources its logistics to third-parties

ITEM&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MANAGEMENT&rsquo;S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This report includes a number of forward looking statements
that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward looking statements are
often identified by words like: believe
 expect
 estimate
 anticipate
 intend
 project and similar expressions
 or words which
by their nature
 refer to future events.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should not place undue certainty on these forward looking statements
 which
apply only as of the date of this annual report.&nbsp;&nbsp;These forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions.







    
    





accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
 which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. We base these significant judgments and
estimates on historical experience and other applicable assumptions we believe to be reasonable based upon information presently
available. These estimates may change as new events occur
 as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment
changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the financial statements as soon as they became known.
Actual results could materially differ from our estimates under different assumptions
 judgments or conditions.

 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 to our financial statements
 included elsewhere in this filing. We have
identified the following as our critical accounting policies and estimates
 which are defined as those that are reflective of significant
judgments and uncertainties
 are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of
operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions
 judgments or conditions.


our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements:

&mdash; The financial
statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;). Management
is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

recorded using the fair value method. The Company accounts for employee stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions
of ASC Topic 718.




 the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10 to eliminate certain financial reporting requirements. In accordance
with that pronouncement we have elected to adopt the elimination of certain financial reporting requirements including the presentation
of inception-to-date information in the statements of operations
 cash flows
 and stockholder&rsquo;s deficiency and labeling the
financial statements as those of a development stage entity.


 FASB and IASB issued a new joint revenue recognition
standard that supersedes nearly all U.S. GAAP guidance on revenue recognition. The core principal of the standard is that revenue
recognition should depict the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The new standard is effective for the Company for the
fiscal year beginning June 1
 2017 and the effects of the standard on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements are
not known at this time.

Management does not believe that
any other recently issued
 but not yet effective accounting pronouncement
 if adopted
 would have a material effect on the accompanying
consolidated financial statements

AND PROCEDURES






 without limitation
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;) is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management
including its principal executive and principal financial officers
 or persons performing similar functions
 as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in
part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
 and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed
in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions
 regardless of how remote.


senior management
 consisting of&nbsp;the Company&rsquo;s principal executive and financial officer and the Company&rsquo;s principal
accounting officer
 the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls
and procedures
 as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this
report (the &ldquo;Evaluation Date&rdquo;). Based on this evaluation
 the Company&rsquo;s principal executive and financial officer

Management&rsquo;s Annual Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting


Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act.&nbsp;Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes of
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore
 even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving their control objectives. In evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting

Control-Integrated Framework&nbsp;&nbsp;
 our officers concluded that
 during the period covered
by this annual report
 our internal controls over financial reporting were operating effectively.


 the Company does not have an audit
committee and is not currently obligated to have one. Although it remains management&rsquo;s view that such a committee is an important
internal control over financial reporting
 management does not believe that the lack of an audit committee could result in a material
misstatement in the Company&rsquo;s financial statements in the near future. Accordingly
 management has concluded that this deficiency
alone does not constitute a material weakness in the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting
 and has considered
the foregoing in its determination that the Company&rsquo;s internal controls over financial reporting and its disclosure controls
and procedures were effective as of the Evaluation Date.

International Delights of America
 Inc. ( the &quot;Company&quot;) was incorporated in Delaware in April 2013. The Company has
not generated significant sales to date. The Company currently markets and sells traditional Hispanice beverages. The Company
plans to market and sell traditional Hispanic and ethnic food packaged products and will license and/or acquire existing brands
and distributors of Hispanic products.


 the Company records revenue when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 services have been rendered or product delivery has occurred
 the sales price to
the customer is fixed or determinable
 and collectability is reasonably assured. The following policies reflect specific criteria
for the various revenues streams of the Company:

is delivered or services are performed. Provision for sales returns are estimated based on the Company's historical return experience.
Revenue is presented net of returns.


preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (&ldquo;U.S. GAAP&rdquo;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


calculates net income (loss) per share based on the authoritative guidance. Basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing
net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share
is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents
outstanding. During periods in which the Company incurs losses common stock equivalents
 if any
 are not considered
 as their
effect would be anti-dilutive. As of May 31
 2015
 the convertible note payable
 which could be converted into 24
000 shares of
common stock
 is outstanding.

Taxes

for income taxes. Under the accrual method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between
the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws
that will be in effect
 when the differences are expected to reverse. An allowance against deferred tax assets is recognized
 when
it is more likely than not
 that such tax benefits will not be realized.

Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of an uncertain tax position only after considering the probability that a
tax authority would sustain the position in an examination. For tax positions meeting a &ldquo;more-likely than-not&rdquo;
threshold
 the amount recognized in the financial statements is the benefit expected to be realized upon settlement with the
tax authority. For tax positions not meeting the threshold
 no financial statement benefit is recognized. The Company
recognizes interest and penalties
 if any
 related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. The Company did not have
any unrecognized tax benefits as of May 31
 2015
 and does not expect this to change significantly over the next 12 months.



    
    


1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)


Company accounts for equity instruments issued to employees in accordance with ASC 718
 Compensation - Stock Compensation.
ASC 718 requires all share-based compensation payments to be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value
on the issuance date. Equity instruments granted to non-employees are accounted for in accordance with ASC 505
 Equity. The
final measurement date for the fair value of equity instruments with performance criteria is the date that each performance
commitment for such equity instrument is satisfied or there is a significant disincentive for non-performance.


considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is based on management's estimate of the amount of receivables that will
actually be collected. As of May 31
 2015 and 2014

 the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10 to eliminate certain financial reporting requirements. In accordance with
that pronouncement we have elected to adopt the elimination of certain financial reporting requirements including the presentation
of inception-to-date information in the statements of operations
 cash flows
 and stockholder&rsquo;s deficiency and labeling
the financial statements as those of a development stage entity.

 FASB and IASB issued a new joint
revenue recognition standard that supersedes nearly all U.S. GAAP guidance on revenue recognition. The core principle of the standard
is that revenue recognition should depict the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The new standard is effective for the Company
for the fiscal year beginning June 1
 2017 and the effects of the standard on the Company&rsquo;s financial statements
are not known at this time.

any other recently issued
 but not yet effective accounting pronouncement
 if adopted
 would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements

 the Financial Accounting Standards&#13;Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10 to eliminate certain financial reporting requirements.

 FASB and IASB issued a new joint&#13;revenue recognition standard that supersedes nearly all U.S. GAAP guidance on revenue recognition.

The new standard is effective for the Company&#13;for the fiscal year beginning June 1

 the Financial Accounting Standards&#13;Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10 to eliminate certain financial reporting requirements.

 FASB and IASB issued a new joint&#13;revenue recognition standard that supersedes nearly all U.S. GAAP guidance on revenue recognition. The core principle of the standard&#13;is that revenue recognition should depict the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration&#13;to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The new standard is effective for the Company&#13;for the fiscal year beginning June 1
 2017 and the effects of the standard on the Company&amp;#146;s financial statements&#13;are not known at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 10pt/115% Times New Roman, Times, Serif; vertical-align: top; padding-right: 5.4pt; padding-left: 5.4pt&gt;Management does not believe that&#13;any other recently issued

CREDIT RISK&#9;


 2015
 sales to
four customers accounted for approximately 79% of the Company's net sales. There were no customers with significant accounts receivable
balances at May 31
 2015. During the year ended May 31
 2014
 sales to two customers accounted for approximately 73% of the Company's
net sales. At May 31
 2014
 one customer accounted for approximately 64% of the Company&#146;s accounts receivable.







The entire disclosure for any concentrations existing at the date of the financial statements that make an entity vulnerable to a reasonably possible
 near-term
 severe impact. This disclosure informs financial statement users about the general nature of the risk associated with the concentration
 and may indicate the percentage of concentration risk as of the balance sheet date.

International Delights of America
 Inc. ( the &#34;Company&#34;) was incorporated in Delaware in April 2013. The Company has
not generated significant sales to date. The Company currently markets and sells traditional Hispanice beverages. The Company
plans to market and sell traditional Hispanic and ethnic food packaged products and will license and/or acquire existing brands
and distributors of Hispanic products.

Revenue is presented net of returns.


preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


calculates net income (loss) per share based on the authoritative guidance. Basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing
net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share
is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents
outstanding. During periods in which the Company incurs losses common stock equivalents

Taxes

for income taxes. Under the accrual method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between
the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws
that will be in effect
 when the differences are expected to reverse. An allowance against deferred tax assets is recognized
 when
it is more likely than not
 that such tax benefits will not be realized.

recognizes the financial statement benefit of an uncertain tax position only after considering the probability that a tax authority
would sustain the position in an examination. For tax positions meeting a &#147;more-likely than-not&#148; threshold
 the amount
recognized in the financial statements is the benefit expected to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority. For tax
positions not meeting the threshold
 no financial statement benefit is recognized. The Company recognizes interest and penalties
if any
 related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. The Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits as of
May 31
 2015
 and does not expect this to change significantly over the next 12 months.

 the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10 to eliminate certain financial reporting requirements. In accordance with
that pronouncement we have elected to adopt the elimination of certain financial reporting requirements including the presentation
of inception-to-date information in the statements of operations
 cash flows
 and stockholder&#146;s deficiency and labeling
the financial statements as those of a development stage entity.

 FASB and IASB issued a new joint
revenue recognition standard that supersedes nearly all U.S. GAAP guidance on revenue recognition. The core principle of the standard
is that revenue recognition should depict the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The new standard is effective for the Company
for the fiscal year beginning June 1
 2017 and the effects of the standard on the Company&#146;s financial statements
are not known at this time.

any other recently issued
 but not yet effective accounting pronouncement
 if adopted
 would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements

net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share

the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws

would sustain the position in an examination. For tax positions meeting a &#147;more-likely than-not&#148; threshold

positions not meeting the threshold
 no financial statement benefit is recognized. The Company recognizes interest and penalties
if any
 related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. The Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits as of

 the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10 to eliminate certain financial reporting requirements. In accordance with
that pronouncement we have elected to adopt the elimination of certain financial reporting requirements including the presentation
of inception-to-date information in the statements of operations
 cash flows
 and stockholder&#146;s deficiency and labeling
the financial statements as those of a development stage entity.

 FASB and IASB issued a new joint
revenue recognition standard that supersedes nearly all U.S. GAAP guidance on revenue recognition. The core principle of the standard
is that revenue recognition should depict the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The new standard is effective for the Company
for the fiscal year beginning June 1
 2017 and the effects of the standard on the Company&#146;s financial statements
are not known at this time.
