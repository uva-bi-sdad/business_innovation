 the different cycles are somewhat offsetting.&#160; Minimal food packaging occurs in the Company's last fiscal quarter ending March 31
 which is the optimal time for maintenance
 repairs and equipment changes in its packaging plants.&#160; The supply of commodities
 current pricing
 and expected new crop quantity and quality affect the timing and amount of the Company's sales and earnings.&#160; When the seasonal harvesting periods of the Company's major fruits and vegetables are newly completed
 inventories for these packaged fruits and vegetables are at their highest levels.&#160; For peas

 an end of year sales order backlog is not considered meaningful.&#160; Traditionally
 larger customers provide tentative bookings for their expected purchases for the upcoming season.&#160; These bookings are further developed as data on the expected size of the related national harvests becomes available.&#160; In general
 these bookings serve as a yardstick rather than as a firm commitment
 since actual harvest results can vary notably from early estimates.&#160; In actual practice







 quality
 service
 and pricing being the major determinants in the Company's relative market position. The Company believes that it is a major producer of canned fruits and vegetables
 but some producers of canned
 frozen and other forms of fruit and vegetable products have sales which exceed the Company's sales.&#160; The Company is aware of approximately 14 competitors in the U.S. packaged vegetable industry
 many of which are privately held companies.&#160; The Company is aware of approximately nine competitors in the U.S. packaged fruit industry.&#160; In addition
 there are significant quantities of fruit that are imported from Europe

.&#160; About 25% of packaged foods sales were packed for institutional food distributors and 52% were retail packed under the private label of our customers.&#160; The remaining 11% was sold under the Alliance Agreement with GMOL and the succeeding contract packing agreement with B&amp;G Foods (collectively the Green Giant Agreement) (see note 12 of Item 8
 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).&#160; Termination of the Green Giant Agreement would substantially reduce the Company's sales and profitability unless the Company was to enter into a new substantial supply relationship with Green Giant or another major vegetable marketer.&#160; The non-Green Giant customers represent a full cross section of the retail

 the Company has cooperated with federal
 state
 and local environmental protection authorities in developing and maintaining suitable antipollution facilities.&#160; In general




 national and international regulations aimed at reducing the effects of climate change.&#160; In the United States
 there is a significant possibility that some form of regulation will be forthcoming at the federal level to address the effects of climate change.&#160; Such regulation could result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes

 investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations







 the Company is made a party to certain legal proceedings seeking monetary damages
 including proceedings involving product liability claims
 worker's compensation and other employee claims
 tort and other general liability claims

 environmental
 employee
 and product safety issues. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of these matters

 could adversely affect the Company's consolidated financial position
 results of operations or cash flows.&#160; Other factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material could also affect our business operations or financial results.&#160; The Company refers to itself as we










 product availability and market prices tend to have an inverse relationship:&#160; market prices tend to decrease as more product is available and to increase if less product is available.&#160; Product availability is a direct result of plantings
 growing conditions
 crop yields and inventory levels
 all of which vary from year to year.&#160; Moreover
 fruit and vegetable production outside the United States
 particularly in Europe
 Asia and South America
 is increasing at a time when worldwide demand for certain products
 such as peaches
 is being impacted by the global economic slowdown.&#160; These factors may have a significant effect on supply and competition and create downward pressure on prices.&#160; In addition
 market prices can be affected by the planting and inventory levels and individual pricing decisions of our competitors.&#160; Generally
 market prices in the fruit and vegetable packaging industry adjust more quickly to variations in product availability than an individual packager can adjust its cost structure; thus
 in an oversupply situation




 the fruit and vegetable packaging industry has been characterized by excess capacity







 we must harvest and package them quickly or forego the opportunity to package fresh picked fruits and vegetables for an entire year.&#160; Most of our fruits and vegetables are grown by farmers under contract with us.&#160; Consequently
 we must pay the contract grower for the fruits and vegetables even if we cannot or do not harvest or package them.&#160; Most of our production occurs during the second quarter (July through September) of our fiscal year
 which corresponds with the quarter that the growing season ends for most of the produce packaged by us.&#160; A majority of our sales occur during the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year due to seasonal consumption patterns for our products.&#160; Accordingly
 inventory levels are highest during the second and third quarters
 and accounts receivable levels are highest during the third and fourth quarters.&#160; Net sales generated during our third and fourth fiscal quarters have a significant impact on our results of operations.&#160; Because of these seasonal fluctuations
 the results of any particular quarter
 particularly in the first half of our fiscal year










 this somewhat reduces the risk that our entire crop will be subject to disastrous weather.&#160; The upper Midwest is the primary growing region for the principal vegetables which we pack
 namely peas
 green beans and corn
 and it is also a substantial source of our competitors' vegetable production.&#160; California is the primary growing region for the fruits we pack
 namely peaches
 pears







 such as fruits and vegetables
 steel (used to make cans)
 ingredients
 pouches and other packaging materials as well as the electricity and natural gas used in our business
 are commodities that may experience price volatility caused by external factors
 including market fluctuations
 availability
 currency fluctuations and changes in governmental regulations and agricultural programs.&#160; General inventory positions of major commodities
 such as field corn
 soybeans and wheat
 all commodities with which we must compete for acreage
 can have dramatic effects on prices for those commodities
 which can translate into similar swings in prices needed to be paid for our contracted commodities.&#160; These programs and other events can result in reduced supplies of these commodities
 higher supply costs or interruptions in our production schedules.&#160; If prices of these commodities increase beyond what we can pass along to our customers














 respectively




 purchases by the United Sates Department of Agriculture (USDA) in fiscal year 2016 represented approximately 5% of our total sales.&#160; The purchase of our products by the USDA is done through the government's competitive bid process.&#160; We bid on stated product requirements and needs as presented by the USDA and
 if we are the successful bidder
 we fulfill the contract and deliver the product.&#160; The government contracting process is complex and subject to numerous regulations and requirements.&#160; Failure by us to comply with the regulations and requirements for government contracts could jeopardize our ability to contract with the government and could result in reduced sales or prohibition on submitting bids to the USDA.&#160; The government procurement process could also change and result in our inability to meet the new requirements.&#160; Additionally
 the government's need for our products could decrease




 our business








 but also compete with products we produce and sell to other companies who market those products under their own brand names
 such as the Green Giant vegetables we sell to B&amp;G Foods under the Contract Packing Agreement and the fruits and vegetables we sell to various retail grocery chains which carry our customer's own brand names.&#160; During 2016




 many major retail food chains have been increasing their promotions
 offerings and shelf space allocations for their own fruit and vegetable brands
 to the detriment of fruit and vegetable brands owned by the packagers
 including our own brands.&#160; We cannot predict the pricing or promotional activities of our customers/competitors or whether they will have a negative effect on us.&#160; There are competitive pressures and other factors
 which could cause our products to lose market share or result in significant price erosion that could materially and adversely affect our business







 intermodal
 rail cars
 and ships.&#160; Disruption to the timely supply of these services or increases in the cost of these services for any reason
 including availability or cost of fuel
 regulations affecting the industry
 or labor shortages in the transportation industry
 could have an adverse effect on our ability to serve our customers
 and could materially and adversely affect our business














 the industry and suppliers to stay abreast of developments.&#160; A product liability judgment against us could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures
 affect consumer confidence in our products
 and divert management's attention from other responsibilities.&#160; Product liability claims may also lead to increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.&#160;&#160; Although we maintain comprehensive general liability insurance coverage
 there can be no assurance that this level of coverage is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost
 if at all.&#160; A product recall or a partially or completely uninsured judgment against us could materially and adversely affect our business







 we regularly dispose of produce wastes (silage) and processing water as well as materials used in plant operation and maintenance
 and our plant boilers
 which generate heat used in packaging
 produce generally small emissions into the air.&#160; These activities and operations are regulated by federal and state laws and the respective federal and state environmental agencies.&#160; Occasionally
 we may be required to remediate conditions found by the regulators to be in violation of environmental law or to contribute to the cost of remediating waste disposal sites
 which we neither owned nor operated
 but in which
 we and other companies deposited waste materials
 usually through independent waste disposal companies.&#160; Future possible costs of environmental remediation
 contributions and penalties could materially and adversely affect our business








 one with substantially more capacity than the other two
 which are not interchangeable since each plant cannot necessarily produce all the can sizes needed.&#160; Although we maintain property and business interruption insurance coverage
 there can be no assurance that this level of coverage is adequate in the event of a catastrophe or significant disruption at these or other Company facilities.&#160; If such an event occurs
 it could materially and adversely affect our business







 we may undertake acquisitions of other businesses or introduce new products
 although there can be no assurances that these will occur.&#160; Such undertakings involve numerous risks and significant investments.&#160; There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire acquisition candidates on favorable terms
 to profitably manage or to successfully integrate future businesses it may acquire or new products it may introduce without substantial costs
 delays or problems.&#160; Any of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business







 we had approximately 3
500 employees of which 3
000 full time and 400 seasonal employees worked in food packaging and 100 employees worked in other activities.&#160; During the peak summer harvest period
 we hire up to approximately 7
000 seasonal employees to help package fruits and vegetables.&#160; If there is an increase to minimum wage rates
 this could have a negative impact cost of operations.&#160; Many of our packaging operations are located in rural communities that may not have sufficient labor pools
 requiring us to hire employees from other regions.&#160; An inability to hire and train sufficient employees during the critical harvest period could materially and adversely affect our business







 in collaboration with other can makers as well as enamel suppliers
 has decided to aggressively work to find alternative materials for can linings not manufactured using BPA. However






 mandatory recall authority of the FDA
 increased scrutiny of foreign sourced or supplied food products
 and increased records access may have an impact on our business. As we are already in a highly regulated business













 along with its other marketplace initiatives
 are designed to capitalize on new customer or consumer trends.&#160; The FDA recently issued a statement on sodium which referred to an Institute of Medicine statement that too much sodium is a major contributor to high blood pressure. Some of our products contain a moderate amount of sodium per recommended serving
 which is based on consumer's preferences for taste. &#160;In order to remain successful
 the Company must anticipate and react to these new trends and develop new products or packages to address them. While the Company devotes significant resources to meeting this goal
 we may not be successful in developing new products or packages







 2012
 the SEC adopted a new rule requiring disclosures of specified minerals
 known as conflict minerals
 that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by companies filing public reports. The rule
 which requires a disclosure report to be filed by May 31 each year
 requires companies to perform country of origin inquiries
 due diligence as required
 disclosure
 and reporting whether such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country.&#160; The conflict mineral rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals
 including
 tin
 which is used primarily in the manufacture of our cans. The number of suppliers
 who provide conflict-free minerals in steel production
 or other components
 may be limited. In addition
 there may be significant costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements
 such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our cans
 as well as costs of possible changes to products
 packages
 or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Since our supply chain is complex
 we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the procedures that we implement
 which may hurt our business. In addition
 we may encounter significant challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free
 which could place us
 as well as our competitors













 including the impact of recessions in the United States and throughout the world
 may negatively affect our business and financial results.&#160; These economic conditions could negatively impact (i) consumer demand for our products
 (ii) the mix of our products' sales
 (iii) our ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis
 (iv) the ability of suppliers to provide the materials required in our operations and (v) our ability to obtain financing or to otherwise access the capital markets.&#160; The strength of the U.S. dollar versus other world currencies could result in increased competition from imported products and decreased sales to our international customers.&#160; A prolonged recession could result in decreased revenue
 margins and earnings.&#160; Additionally
 the economic situation could have an impact on our lenders or customers
 causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.&#160; The occurrence of any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business









 2016
 we had approximately $321.2 million of total indebtedness
 including various debt agreements and a $271.6 million outstanding balance on our $400.0 million to $475.0 million revolving credit facility (Revolver).&#160; Scheduled debt service for fiscal 2017 is $279.8 million since the Revolver matures on July 20
 2016.&#160; The Company is evaluating its alternatives related to these payments.&#160;&#160;During our second and third fiscal quarters
 our operations generally require more cash than is available from operations.&#160; In these circumstances
 it is necessary to borrow under our Revolver.&#160; Our ability to obtain financing in the future through credit facilities will be affected by several factors
 including our creditworthiness
 our ability to operate in a profitable manner and general market and credit conditions.&#160; Significant changes in our business or cash outflows from operations could create a need for additional working capital.&#160; An inability to obtain additional working capital on terms reasonably acceptable to us or access the Revolver would materially and adversely affect our operations. Additionally
 if we need to use a portion of our cash flows to pay principal and interest on our debt
 it will reduce the amount of money we have for operations
 working capital
 capital expenditures
 expansions







 among other things
 limit our ability to borrow money
 including with respect to the refinancing of existing indebtedness. These provisions may limit our ability to conduct our business
 take advantage of business opportunities and respond to changing business
 market and economic conditions. In addition
 they may place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies that may be subject to fewer
 if any
 restrictions. Failure to comply with the requirements of our Revolver and debt agreements could materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. We have pledged our accounts receivable
 inventory and the capital stock or other ownership interests that we own in our subsidiaries to secure the credit facility. If a default occurred and was not cured

 a plan for our merger or consolidation must be approved by two-thirds of the votes of all outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon. See Our existing shareholders, if acting together, may be able to exert control over matters requiring shareholder approval.



















 First-Out (LIFO) method of inventory accounting.&#160; As of March 31
 2016
 we had a LIFO reserve of $139.3 million which
 at the U.S. corporate tax rate
 represents approximately $48.8 million of income taxes
 payment of which is delayed to future dates based upon changes in inventory costs.&#160; From time-to-time
 discussions regarding changes in U.S. tax laws have included the potential of LIFO being repealed.&#160; Should LIFO be repealed
 the $48.8 million of postponed taxes
 plus any future benefit realized prior to the date of repeal
 would likely have to be repaid over some period of time.&#160; Repayment of these postponed taxes will reduce the amount of cash that we would have available to fund our operations
 working capital
 capital expenditures
 expansions
 acquisitions or general corporate or other business activities. This could materially and adversely affect our business

 Based on our assessment
 management believes that

 as of March 31
 2016
 and Gray constituted 1.8% and (2.8)% of revenues and net earnings (loss)
 respectively
 and Diana constituted 0.2% and (0.3)% of revenues and net earnings (loss)
 respectively
 for the year then ended March 31
 2016.&#160; Refer to Note 2

 the Company exercised $75.0 million for the in-season facility and $100.0 million for the off-season facility of the remaining $150.0 million accordion feature of its existing revolving credit facility pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement dated July 20
 2011.&#160; Maximum borrowings under the Revolver total $400.0 million from April through July and $475.0 million from August through March.&#160; The Revolver balance as of March 31
 2016 was $271.6 million and is included in Current Portion of Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet due to the Revolver's July 20
 2016 maturity. In order to maintain availability of funds under the facility
 the Company pays a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolver.&#160; The Revolver is secured by the Company's accounts receivable and inventories and contains a financial covenant and borrowing base requirements.&#160; The Company utilizes its Revolver for general corporate purposes
 including seasonal working capital needs
 to pay debt principal and interest obligations
 and to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions. Seasonal working capital needs are affected by the growing cycles of the vegetables and fruits the Company packages. The majority of vegetable and fruit inventories are produced during the months of June through November and are then sold over the following year. Payment terms for vegetable and fruit produce are generally three months but can vary from a few days to seven months. Accordingly






 the agreement being negotiated provides for a five-year term

 pay dividends on the Company's capital stock
 make other restricted payments
 including investments
 sell the Company's assets
 incur liens
 transfer all or substantially all of the Company's assets and enter into consolidations or mergers. The Company's debt agreements also require the Company to meet a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The Revolver also contains borrowing base requirements related to accounts receivable and inventories. These financial requirements and ratios generally become more restrictive over time and are subject to allowances for seasonal fluctuations. The most restrictive financial covenant in the debt agreements is the fixed charge coverage ratio within the Master Reimbursement Agreement with Wells Fargo
 which relates to the Secured Industrial Revenue Development Bonds. In connection with the Company's decision to adopt the LIFO method of inventory accounting
 effective December&#160;30
 2007
 the Company executed amendments to its debt agreements
 which enable the Company to compute its financial covenants as if the Company were on the FIFO method of inventory accounting. The Company was in compliance with all such financial covenants as of March 31

 accounts receivable decreased by $7.1&#160;million or 9.3% versus 2014







 inventories increased by $95.3&#160;million primarily reflecting the effect of higher finished goods quantities and higher work in process quantities and the $24.8 million LIFO reserve decline. The LIFO reserve balance was $139.3&#160;million at March 31

 the Company's defined benefit plan has an unfunded pension liability of $37.8 million which is subject to certain actuarial assumptions.&#160; The unfunded status decreased by $17.2&#160; million during 2016 reflecting the actual fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation as of March 31
 2016.&#160; This unfunded status reduction was recognized via the actual gain on plan assets and the decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $3.5 million after the income tax benefit of $2.4 million.&#160; The increase in projected benefit obligation was a function of using the full yield curve approach
 an increase in the discount rate from 4.15% to 4.36% and the change to using an updated mortality table. During 2016
 the Company converted to the 2006 base rates from the RP-2014 mortality study with the Blue Collar adjustment
 with a generational projection of future mortality improvements from 2006 using Scale MP-2015 for calculating the pension obligation in 2016 and the related pension expense in 2017.&#160; Effective March 31
 2016
 the Company elected to change the approach used to calculate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit cost for it pension and postretirement benefit plans to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs.&#160; Historically the Company calculated the service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period.&#160; Going forward the new estimate utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows.&#160; The change does not affect the measurement of pension and postretirement obligations and is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate

Settlement of these liabilities typically occurs in subsequent periods primarily through an authorized process for deductions taken by a retailer from amounts otherwise due to the Company. As a result



&#8212; Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of trade receivables and interest-bearing investments. Wholesale and retail food distributors comprise a significant portion of the trade receivables; collateral is generally not required. A relatively limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the Company's total sales. GMOL sales represented 11%

 2016.&#160; This unfunded status reduction was recognized via the actual gain on plan assets and the decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $3.5 million after the income tax benefit of $2.2 million.&#160; The increase in projected benefit obligation was a function of using the full yield curve approach
 an increase in the discount rate from 4.15% to 4.36% and the change to using an updated mortality table. During 2016
 the Company converted to the 2006 base rates from the RP-2014 mortality study with the Blue Collar adjustment
 with a generational projection of future mortality improvements from 2006 using Scale MP-2015 for calculating the pension obligation in 2016 and the related pension expense in 2017.&#160; Effective March 31
 2016
 the Company elected to change the approach used to calculate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit cost for it pension and postretirement benefit plans to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs.&#160; Historically the Company calculated the service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period.&#160; Going forward the new estimate utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows.&#160; The change does not affect the measurement of pension and postretirement obligations and is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate

The Company seeks to accomplish its return objectives by prudently investing in a diversified portfolio of public company equities with broad industry representation seeking to provide long-term growth consistent with the performance of relevant market indices

The strategy of being fully invested in equities has historically provided greater rates of return over extended periods of time.&#160; The Company's gain on plan assets during 2016 was 1.4% as compared to the S&amp;P 500 unaudited loss (including dividends) of (1.3)%.

 2007 (beginning of 4th quarter of Fiscal Year 2008)
 the Company changed its inventory valuation method from the lower of cost
 determined under the FIFO method
 or market to the lower of cost
 determined under the LIFO method
 or market. In the high inflation environment that the Company was experiencing
 the Company believed that the LIFO inventory method was preferable over the FIFO method because it better compares the cost of current production to current revenue. The effect of LIFO was to increase net earnings by $16.1 million in 2016
 reduce net earnings by $6.9 million in 2015
 and reduce net earnings by $13.2 million in 2014
 compared to what would have been reported using the FIFO inventory method. The increase in earnings per share was $1.62 ($1.60 diluted) in 2016
 reduce earnings per share was $0.64 ($0.63 diluted) in 2015
 and reduce earnings per share was $1.19 ($1.19 diluted) in 2014.&#160; During 2014
 certain inventory quantities accounted for on the LIFO method were reduced
 resulting in the liquidation of certain quantities carried at costs prevailing in prior years.&#160; The impact on net earnings of these liquidations was no impact in 2016 and 2015

 the Company received a Notice of Violation of the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986
 commonly known as Proposition 65
 from the Environmental Law Foundation (ELF).&#160; This notice was made to the California Attorney General and various other government officials
 and to 49 companies including Seneca Foods Corporation whom ELF alleges manufactured
 distributed or sold packaged peaches
 pears
 fruit cocktail and fruit juice that contain lead without providing a clear and reasonable warning to consumers.&#160; Under California law
 proper notice must be made to the State and involved firms at least 60 days before any suit under Proposition 65 may be filed by private litigants like ELF.&#160; That 60-day period has expired and to date neither the California Attorney General nor any appropriate district attorney or city attorney has initiated an action against the Company.&#160; However
 private litigant ELF filed an action against the Company and 27 other named companies on September 28
 2011
 in Superior Court of Alameda County
 California
 alleging violations of Proposition 65 and seeking various measures of relief
 including injunctive and declaratory relief and civil penalties.&#160; The Company
 along with the other named companies
 vigorously defended the claim.&#160; A responsive answer was filed
 the discovery process was completed and a trial on liability was held beginning in April of 2013 in accordance with court schedules.&#160; The trial was completed on May 16
 2013 and
 on July 15
 2013 the judge issued a tentative and proposed statement of decision agreeing with the Company
 and the other defendants
 that the safe harbor defense had been met under the regulations relating to Proposition 65 and the Company will not be required to place a Proposition 65 warning label on the products at issue in the case.&#160; The trial decision was finalized and the decision was appealed by ELF with a filing dated October 3
 2013.&#160; The California Court of Appeal
 First Appellate District
 Division One unanimously rejected the appeal by ELF in a decision dated March 17
 2015.&#160; ELF filed a petition for review with the California Supreme Court on April 28
 2015
 and the petition was denied on July 8
 2015. &#160; With the successful defense of the case
 the remedies portion of the case was not litigated and the denial of review by the California Supreme Court ended the action.&#160; Our portion of legal fees in defense of this action have been sizable
 as would be expected with litigation resulting in trial
 and the appeal
 but have not had a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position

 the actuarial present value of benefits (whether vested or nonvested) attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered before a specified date and based on employee service and compensation (if applicable) before that date. The accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation in that it includes no assumption about future compensation levels. For plans with flat-benefit or nonpay-related pension benefit formulas
 the accumulated benefit obligation and the projected benefit obligation are the same.






















































































1) For defined benefit pension plans
 the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation
 which is the actuarial present value as of a date of all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered prior to that date.  2) For other postretirement defined benefit plans
 the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
 which is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed to employee service rendered to a particular date.

























































Assets
 usually stocks
 bonds
 and other investments
 that have been segregated and restricted (usually in a trust) to provide benefits
 at their fair value as of the measurement date. Plan assets include amounts contributed by the employer (and by employees for a contributory plan) and amounts earned from investing the contributions
 less benefits paid. If a plan has liabilities other than for benefits
 those non-benefit obligations may be considered as reductions of plan assets.












































































































































































Amount of tax (expense) benefit
 before reclassification adjustments
 related to (increase) decrease in accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

The difference between fair value of plan assets at the end of the period and the fair value at the beginning of the period
 adjusted for contributions and payments of benefits during the period
 and after adjusting for taxes and other expenses
 as applicable.




























Amount of gain (loss) related to change in benefit obligation resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions
 for example
 but not limited to
 interest
 mortality
 employee turnover
 salary
 and temporary deviation from the substantive plan.




























1) For defined benefit pension plans
 the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation
 which is the actuarial present value as of a date of all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered prior to that date.  2) For other postretirement defined benefit plans
 the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
 which is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed to employee service rendered to a particular date.




























The amount of payments made for which participants are entitled under a pension plan
 including pension benefits
 death benefits
 and benefits due on termination of employment. Also includes payments made under a postretirement benefit plan
 including prescription drug benefits
 health care benefits
 life insurance benefits
 and legal
 educational and advisory services. This item represents a periodic decrease to the plan obligations and a decrease to plan assets.



















































































































Assets
 usually stocks
 bonds
 and other investments
 that have been segregated and restricted (usually in a trust) to provide benefits
 at their fair value as of the measurement date. Plan assets include amounts contributed by the employer (and by employees for a contributory plan) and amounts earned from investing the contributions
 less benefits paid. If a plan has liabilities other than for benefits
 those non-benefit obligations may be considered as reductions of plan assets.

























































The amount of increase or decrease due to a change in the terms of an existing plan or the initiation of a new plan. A plan amendment may increase or decrease benefits
 including those attributed to years of service already rendered.

























































The amount of unfunded commitments for which the entity is obligated
 to those certain investments for which net asset value per share is calculated (including by unit
 membership interest
 or other equity (ownership interest) unit measure) (alternative investments).

The pretax net amount of gains and losses that are not yet recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost
 and that are recognized as increases or decreases in other comprehensive income as they arise. Gains and losses are due to changes in the value of either the benefit obligation or the plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed or from a change in an actuarial assumption
 or the consequence of a decision to temporarily deviate from the substantive plan.
