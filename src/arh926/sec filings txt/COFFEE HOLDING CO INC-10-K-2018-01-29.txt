General
Overview

Products
 We are an integrated wholesale coffee roaster and dealer in the United States. Our core products can be
divided into three categories:



    
    
Wholesale
 unroasted raw beans imported from around the world and sold to large and small roasters and coffee shop
    operators;

    
    
    

    
    
Private
 coffee roasted
 blended
 packaged and sold under the specifications and names of others
 including supermarkets
    that want to have their own brand name on coffee to compete with national brands; and

    
    
    

    
    
Branded
 coffee roasted and blended to our own specifications and packaged and sold under our seven proprietary and
    licensed brand names in different segments of the market.


Our
private label and branded coffee products are sold throughout the United States
 Canada and certain countries in Asia to supermarkets
wholesalers
 and individually owned and multi-unit retail customers. Our unprocessed green coffee
 which includes over 90 specialty
coffee offerings
 is primarily sold to specialty gourmet roasters.

We
conduct our operations in accordance with strict freshness and quality standards. All of our private label and branded coffees
are produced from high quality coffee beans that are deep roasted for full flavor using a slow roasting process that has been
perfected utilizing our more than thirty years of experience in the coffee industry. In order to ensure freshness
 our products
are delivered to our customers within 72 hours of roasting. We believe that our long history has enabled us to develop a loyal
customer base.

In
June 2016
 we acquired substantially all of the assets of Coffee Kinetics LLC (doing business as Sonofresco) through our wholly-owned
subsidiary Sonofresco
 LLC (&ldquo;Sonofresco&rdquo; or &ldquo;SONO&rdquo;)
 including equipment
 inventory
 customer lists
relationships and accounts payable. In addition to our wholesale green coffee
 private label coffee and branded coffee product
offerings
 we currently sell tabletop coffee roasting equipment to our customers through Sonofresco.

On
February 23
 2017
 we purchased all the outstanding common stock of Comfort Foods
 Inc. (&ldquo;CFI&rdquo;). CFI is a medium sized
regional roaster
 manufacturing both branded and private label coffee for retail and foodservice customers located predominantly
in the northeast United States marketplace.

We
were incorporated on October 9
 1995 under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name Transpacific International Group Corp
(&ldquo;Transpacific&rdquo;). On April 16
 1998
 Transpacific completed a merger with Coffee Holding Co.
 Inc.
 a New York corporation.
Upon the consummation of the merger
 Coffee Holding Co.
 Inc. was merged into Transpacific and Transpacific changed its name to
Coffee Holding Co.
 Inc.

Our
corporate offices are located at 3475 Victory Boulevard
 Staten Island
 New York 10314. Our telephone number is (718) 832-0800
and our website address is www.coffeeholding.com. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

Our
Competitive Strengths

To
achieve our growth objectives described below
 we intend to leverage the following competitive strengths:

Positioned
We believe that we are one of the few coffee companies
to offer a broad array of branded and private label roasted ground coffees and wholesale green coffee across the spectrum of consumer
tastes
 preferences and price points. While many of our competitors engage in distinct segments of the coffee business
 we sell
products in each of the following areas:


    
    




    
    
Retail
    branded coffee;

    
    
    

    
    
Mainstream
    retail private label coffee;

    
    
    

    
    
Specialty
    retail coffees both private label and branded;

    
    
    

    
    
Wholesale
    specialty green and gourmet whole bean coffees;

    
    
    

    
    
Food
    service;

    
    
    

    
    
Instant
    coffees; 

    
    
    

    
    
Tea;
    and

    
    
    

    
    
Tabletop
    coffee roasting equipment.


Our
branded and private label roasted ground coffees are sold at competitive and value price levels while some of our other branded
and specialty coffees are sold predominantly at premium price levels. Premium price level coffee is high-quality gourmet coffee
such as AA Arabica coffee
 which sell at a substantial premium over traditional retail canned coffee
 while competitive and value
price level coffee is mainstream or traditional canned coffee. Because of this diversification
 we believe that our profitability
is not dependent on any one area of the coffee industry and
 therefore
 is less sensitive than our competition to potential coffee
commodity price and overall economic volatility.

Wholesale
 As a large roaster-dealer of green coffee
 we believe that we are favorably positioned to
increase our specialty coffee sales. Since 1998
 we have increased the number of our wholesale green coffee customers
 including
coffee houses
 single store operators
 mall coffee stores and mail order sellers
 by 547% from 150 to 971. We are a charter member
of the Specialty Coffee Association of America and one of the largest distributors of Swiss Water Processed Decaffeinated Coffees
and Datteral specialty Brazil coffees along the east coast of the United States. Our over 40 years of experience as a roaster
and a dealer of green coffee allows us to provide our roasting experience as a value added service to our gourmet roaster customers.
The assistance we provide to our customers includes training
 coffee blending and market identification. We believe that our relationships
with wholesale green coffee customers and our focus on selling green coffee as a wholesaler has enabled us to participate in the
growth of the specialty coffee market while mitigating the risks associated with the competitive retail specialty coffee environment.

Diverse
We have amassed a portfolio of five proprietary name brands sold to supermarkets
wholesalers and individually owned stores in the United States
 including brands for specialty espresso
 Latin espresso
 Italian
espresso
 100% Colombian coffee and blended and flavored coffees. In addition
 we have entered into a licensing agreement with
Del Monte Corporation for the exclusive right to use the S&amp;W trademark in the United States and other countries approved by
Del Monte Corporation in connection with the production
 manufacture and sale of roasted whole bean and ground coffee for distribution
to retail customers. Our existing portfolio of differentiated brands combined with our management expertise serve as a platform
to add additional name brands through acquisition or licensing agreements which target product niches and segments that do not
compete with our existing brands.

Management
 We have been a family-operated business for three generations. Throughout
this time
 we have remained strong through varying cycles in the coffee industry and the economy. Andrew Gordon
 our President
Chief Executive Officer
 Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
 and David Gordon
 our Executive Vice President &ndash; Operations
have worked with Coffee Holding for 35 and 37 years
 respectively. David Gordon is an original member of the Specialty Coffee
Association of America. We believe that our employees and management are dedicated to our vision and mission
 which is to produce
high quality products
 as well as to provide quality and responsive service to our customers.

Our
Growth Strategy

We
believe that significant growth opportunities exist by selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions and alliances
 targeting the
rapidly growing Hispanic market in the United States
 increasing penetration with existing customers by adding new products
 and
developing our food service business. By capitalizing on this strategy
 we hope to continue to grow our business with our commitment
to quality and personalized service to our customers. We do not intend to compete on price alone nor do we intend to expand sales
at the expense of profitability.


    
    


Selectively
 We have expanded our operations by acquiring coffee companies
 entering into
strategic alliances and acquiring or licensing brands
 which complement our business objectives and we intend to continue to seek
such opportunities.

Grow
We believe the Hispanic population in the United States is the fastest growing
and now represents the largest minority demographic in the United States. We believe there is significant opportunity for our
Caf&eacute; Caribe and Caf&eacute; Supremo brands to gain market share among Hispanic consumers in the United States. Caf&eacute;
Caribe
 which has historically been our leading brand by poundage
 is a specialty espresso coffee that targets espresso coffee
drinkers and
 in particular
 Hispanic consumers. Caf&eacute; Supremo is a specialty espresso coffee which is priced for the more
price sensitive Hispanic espresso coffee drinker.

Further
 We intend to capture additional market share through our existing distribution
channels by selectively adding or introducing new brand names and products across multiple price points
 including:



    
    
New
    Licensing agreements;

    
    
    

    
    
Specialty
    blends and foodservice opportunities;

    
    
    

    
    
Teton
    tea;

    
    
    

    
    
Cold
    brew; and

    
    
    

    
    
Sales
    of our tabletop coffee roasting equipment.


Our
Core Products

Our
core products can be divided into three categories:



    
    
Wholesale
unroasted raw beans imported from around the world and sold to large
 medium and small roasters and
    coffee shop operators;

    
    
    

    
    
Private
coffee roasted
 blended
 packaged and sold under the specifications and names of others
 including supermarkets
    that want to have their own brand name on coffee to compete with national brands; and

    
    
    

    
    
Branded
 coffee roasted and blended to our own specifications and packaged and sold under our seven proprietary and
    licensed brand names in different segments of the market.


Wholesale
 The specialty coffee market represents the fastest growing area of our industry. The number of gourmet coffee
houses have been increasing in all areas of the United States. The growth in specialty coffee sales has created a marketplace
for higher quality and differentiated products
 which can be priced at a premium in the marketplace. As a large roaster-dealer
of green coffee
 we are favorably positioned to increase our specialty coffee sales. We sell green coffee beans to small roasters
and coffee shop operators located throughout the United States and carry over approximately 90 different varieties. Specialty
green coffee beans are sold unroasted
 direct from warehouses to small roasters and gourmet coffee shop operators
 which then
roast the beans themselves. We sell from as little as one bag (132 pounds) to a full truckload (44
000 pounds) of specialty green
coffee beans
 depending on the size and need of the customer. We believe that we can increase sales of wholesale green coffee
without an increase in infrastructure as well as without venturing into the highly competitive retail specialty coffee environment.
We believe that by utilizing our current strategy we can be as profitable or more profitable than our competitors in this segment
by selling &ldquo;one bag at a time&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;one cup at a time.&rdquo;


    
    


Private
 We roast
 blend
 package and sell coffee under private labels for companies throughout the United States
and Canada. Our private label coffee is sold in cans
 brick packages and instants in a variety of sizes. As of October 31
 2017
 We produce private label coffee
for customers who desire to sell coffee under their own name but do not want to engage in the manufacturing process. Our private
label customers seek a quality similar to the national brands at a lower cost
 which represents a better value for the consumer.

Branded
. We roast and blend our branded coffee
according to our own recipes and package the coffee at our facilities in La Junta
 Colorado
 North Andover
 Massachusetts
and Brecksville
 Ohio. We then sell the packaged coffee under our brand labels to supermarkets
 wholesalers and individually-owned
stores throughout the United States.

We
hold trademarks for each of our proprietary name brands and have the exclusive right to use the S&amp;W
 IL CLASSICO brand names
in the United States in connection with the production
 manufacture and sale of roasted whole bean and ground coffee for distribution
at the retail level. For further information regarding our trademark rights
 see &ldquo;Business&mdash;Trademarks.&rdquo;

Each
of our name brands is directed at a particular segment of the coffee market. Our branded coffees are:

Cafe
Caribe
 a specialty espresso coffee that targets espresso coffee drinkers and
 in particular
 the Hispanic consumer market;

Don
Manuel
 is produced from the finest 100% Colombian coffee beans. Don Manuel is an upscale quality product which commands
a substantial premium compared to the more traditional brown coffee blends. We also use this known trademark in our food service
business because of the high brand quality;


an upscale canned coffee established in 1921 and includes Premium
 Premium Decaf
 French Roast
 Colombian
 Colombian Decaf
 Swiss
Water Decaf
 Kona
 Mellow&rsquo;d Roast and IL CLASSICO lines;

Cafe
Supremo
 a specialty espresso that targets espresso drinkers of all backgrounds and tastes. It is designed to introduce
coffee drinkers to the tastes of dark roasted coffee;

Via
Roma
 an Italian espresso targeted at the more traditional espresso drinker; and

Premier
Roasters
 a line of high quality retail and foodservice products packed in composite cans and poly bags.

Harmony
Bay
 an upscale line of both flavored beans and bags incorporating an array of unique flavors including hazelnut and winterspice.

Other
Products

We
also offer several niche products
 including:



    
    
tea;
    

    
    
    

    
    
cold
    brew; and

    
    
    

    
    
table-top
    coffee roasters.


Raw
Materials

Coffee
is a commodity traded on the Commodities and Futures Exchange subject to price fluctuations. Over the past five years
 the average
price per pound of coffee beans ranged from approximately $1.03 to $3.05. The price for coffee beans on the commodities market
as of October 31
 2017 and 2016 was $1.25 and $1.64 per pound
 respectively. Specialty green coffee
 unlike most coffee
is not tied directly to the commodities cash markets. Instead
 it tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a substantial premium
over commodity coffee pricing
 depending on the origin
 supply and demand at the time of purchase. We are a licensed Fair Trade
dealer for Fair Trade certified coffee. Fair Trade certified coffee helps small coffee farmers to increase their incomes and improve
the prospects of their communities and families by guaranteeing farmers a minimum price of ten cents above the current market
price. Our Ohio Facility operated by Generations Coffee Company
 LLC (&ldquo;GCC&rdquo;) is certified organic by the Organic Crop
Improvement Association (OCIA). All of our specialty green coffees
 as well as all of the other coffees we import for roasting
are subject to multiple levels of quality control.


    
    


We
purchase our green coffee from dealers located primarily within the United States. The dealers supply us with coffee beans from
many countries
 including Colombia
 Mexico
 Kenya
 Indonesia
 Brazil and Uganda. For the fiscal years ended 2017 and 2016
 approximately
50% and 43%
 respectively of all of our green coffee purchases were from five suppliers. One of these suppliers
 Rothfos Corporation
accounted for approximately $6.7 million
 or 10%
 in 2017
 and $8.5 million
 or 13%
 in 2016
 of our total product purchases.
An employee of Rothfos Corporation is one of our directors. We do not have any formalized
 material agreements or long-term contracts
with any of these suppliers. Rather
 our purchases are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders. We do not believe
that the loss of any one supplier
 including Rothfos
 would have a material adverse effect on our operations due to the availability
of alternate suppliers.

The
supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control.
Supply and price can be affected by factors such as weather
 politics
 currency fluctuations and economics within the countries
that export coffee. Increases in the cost of coffee beans can
 to a certain extent
 be passed on to our customers in the form
of higher prices for coffee beans and processed coffee. Drastic or prolonged increases in coffee prices may also adversely impact
our business as it could lead to a decline in overall consumption of coffee. Similarly
 rapid decreases in the cost of coffee
beans may force us to lower our sale prices before realizing cost reductions in our purchases.

We
subject all of our private unroasted green coffee to both a pre-shipment sample approval and an additional sample approval upon
arrival into the United States. Once the arrival sample is approved
 we then bring the coffee to one of our facilities to roast
and blend according to our own strict specifications. During the roasting and blending process
 samples are pulled off the production
line and tested on an hourly basis to ensure that each batch roasted is consistent with the others and meets the strict quality
standards demanded by our customers and us.

Our
Use of Derivatives

The
supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control.
Historically
 we have used
 and intend to continue to use in a limited capacity
 short-term coffee futures and options contracts
primarily for the purpose of partially hedging the effects of changing green coffee prices and to reduce our costs of sales


we acquired
 and expect to continue to acquire
 futures contracts with longer terms
 generally three to four months
 primarily
for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on options and futures
contracts are reflected in our cost of sales. Gains on options and futures contracts reduce our cost of sales and losses on options
and futures contracts increase our cost of sales. The use of these derivative financial instruments has generally enabled us to

 in normal economic times
 our hedging
policies remain a vital element of our business model not only in controlling our cost of sales
 but also giving us the flexibility
to obtain the inventory necessary to continue to grow our sales while trying to minimize margin compression during a time of historically
high coffee prices. However

on futures contracts when prices decline significantly in a short period of time
 and we would generally remain exposed to supply

we have had net gains on options and futures contracts in the past
 we have incurred significant losses on options and futures
contracts during some reporting periods. In these cases
 our cost of sales has increased
 resulting in a decrease in our profitability
or increase our losses. Such losses have and could in the future materially increase our cost of sales and materially decrease
our profitability and adversely affect our stock price. See &ldquo;Item 1A &ndash; Risk Factors - If our hedging policy is not
effective
 we may not be able to control our coffee costs
 we may be forced to pay greater than market value for green coffee

materially adversely affect our business and operating results. If the hedges that we enter do not adequately offset the risks
of coffee bean price volatility or our hedges result in losses
 our cost of sales may increase
 resulting in a decrease in profitability
or increased losses. As previously announced
 as a result of the volatile nature of the commodities markets
 we have and are continuing
to scale back our use of hedging and short-term trading of coffee futures and options contracts
 and intend to continue to use
these practices in a limited capacity going forward. See &ldquo;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&mdash;Commodity
Price Risks.&rdquo;


    
    


Trademarks
and Tradename

We
hold trademarks
 registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office
 for all seven of our proprietary coffee
brands and an exclusive license for S&amp;W
 IL CLASSICO brands for sale in the United States. Trademark registrations are subject
to periodic renewal and we anticipate maintaining our registrations. We believe that our brands are recognizable in the marketplace
and that brand recognition is important to the success of our branded coffee business.



We
sell our private label and our branded coffee to some of the largest retail and wholesale customers in the United States (according
). We sell wholesale green coffee to Keurig Green Mountain
 Inc. &ldquo;GMCR&rdquo;. Sales to GMCR accounted
for approximately $5.9 million or approximately 8% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2017
 and $22.6 million
or 29% for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2016.

Although
our agreements with wholesale customers generally contain only pricing terms
 our contracts with certain customers also contain
minimum and maximum purchase obligations at fixed prices. Because our profits on a fixed-price contract could decline if coffee
prices increased
 we acquire futures contracts with longer terms (generally three to four months) primarily for the purpose of
guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee at favorable prices. Although the use of these derivative financial instruments
has generally enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices
 no strategy can entirely eliminate pricing risks or increased
losses and we generally remain exposed to losses on futures contacts when prices decline significantly in a short period of time
and we would generally remain exposed to supply risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to any futures contracts.
See &ldquo;Our Use of Derivatives.&rdquo;



We
market our private label and wholesale coffee through trade shows
 industry publications
 face-to-face contact and through the
use of our internal sales force and non-exclusive independent food and beverage sales brokers. We also use our web site (www.coffeeholding.com)
as a method of marketing our coffee products and ourselves.

For
our private label and branded coffees
 we will
 from time to time in conjunction with retailers and with wholesalers
 conduct
in-store promotions
 such as product demonstrations
 coupons
 price reductions
 two-for-one sales and new product launches to
capture changing consumer taste preferences for upscale canned coffees.

We
evaluate opportunities for growth consistent with our business objectives. In addition
 we have established relationships with
independent sales brokers to market our products across the United States
 in areas of the country where we have not had a high
penetration of sales and Canada. We utilize our in-house sales personnel to market our private label brands. We intend to capture
additional market share in our existing distribution channels by selectively adding or introducing new brand names and products
across multiple price points
 including niche specialty blends
 private label &ldquo;value&rdquo; blends and tea and our own brands
filter packages
 and peripheral products.

Charitable
Activities

We
are also a supporter of several coffee-oriented charitable organizations and during fiscal 2017 and 2016
 we donated approximately
$49
000 and $46
000
 respectively
 to charities.


    
    




    
    
For
    over 20 years
 we have been members of Coffee Kids
 an international non-profit organization that helps to improve the quality
    of life of children and their families in coffee-growing communities in Mexico
 Guatemala
 Nicaragua and Costa Rica.

    
    
    

    
    
We
    are members of Grounds for Health
 an organization that educates
 screens
 and arranges treatment for women who have cancer
    and live in the rural coffee growing communities of Mexico.

    
    
    

    
    
We
    are a licensed Fair Trade dealer of Fair Trade certified coffee. Fair Trade certified coffee helps small coffee farmers to
    increase their incomes and improve the prospects of their communities and families. It guarantees farmers a minimum price
    of $1.40 per pound or fifteen cents above the current market price.

    
    
    

    
    
We
    are the administrative benefactors to a non-profit organization called Cup for Education. After discovering the lack of schools
    teachers
 and basic fundamental learning supplies in the poor coffee growing communities of Central and Latin America
 &ldquo;Cup&rdquo;
    was established by our employee
 Karen Gordon
 to help build schools
 sponsor teachers
 and purchase basic supplies such as
    books
 chalk and other necessities for a proper education.




The
coffee market is highly competitive. We compete in the following areas:

Wholesale
 There are many green coffee dealers throughout the United States. Many of these dealers have greater financial
resources than we do. However
 we believe that we have both the knowledge and the capability to assist small specialty gourmet
coffee roasters with developing and growing their businesses. Our over 40 years of experience as a roaster and a dealer of green
coffee allows us to provide our roasting experience as a value added service to our gourmet roaster customers. While other coffee
merchants may be able to offer lower prices for coffee beans
 we market ourselves as a value-added supplier to small roasters
with the ability to help them market their specialty coffee products and develop a customer base. The assistance we provide our
customers includes training
 coffee blending and market identification. Because specialty green coffee beans are sold unroasted
to small coffee shops and roasters that market their products to local gourmet customers
 we do not believe that our specialty
green coffee customers compete with our private label or branded coffee lines of business. We believe that the addition of Organic
Products Trading Company
 LLC (&ldquo;OPTCO&rdquo;) and Sonofresco as well as our external green coffee salespeople allows us
to compete more effectively throughout the country and Canada.

Private
 There are several major producers of coffee for private label sales in the United States. Many other
companies produce coffee for sale on a regional basis. Our main competitor is the Massimo Zanetti Beverage Company. The Massimo
Zanetti Beverage Company is larger and has more financial and other resources than we do and
 therefore
 is able to devote more
resources to product development and marketing. We believe that we remain competitive by providing a higher level of quality and
customer service. This service includes ensuring that the coffee produced for each label maintains a consistent taste and is delivered
on time and in the proper quantities.

Branded
 Our proprietary brand coffees compete with many other brands that are sold in supermarkets and specialty
stores
 primarily in the Northeastern United States. The branded coffee market in both the Northeast and elsewhere is dominated
by three large companies: Kraft General Foods
 Inc. (owner of the Maxwell House brand)
 J.M. Smucker Co. (owner of the Folgers
and Caf&eacute; Bustelo brands) and Massimo Zanetti Beverage Group which also markets specialty coffee in addition to non-specialty
coffee. Our large competitors have greater access to capital and a greater ability to conduct marketing and promotions. We believe
that
 while our competitors&rsquo; brands may be more nationally recognizable
 our Caf&eacute; Caribe and Caf&eacute; Supremo
brands are competitive in the fast growing Hispanic demographic and our S&amp;W brand has been a popular and recognizable brand
on the west coast for over 80 years.


    
    


Government
Regulation

Our
coffee roasting operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations
 which require us to obtain licenses relating
to customs
 health and safety
 building and land use and environmental protection. Our roasting facility is subject to state and
local air-quality and emissions regulation. If we encounter difficulties in obtaining any necessary licenses or if we have difficulty
complying with these laws and regulations
 then we could be subject to fines and penalties
 which could have a material adverse
effect on our profitability. In addition
 our product offerings could be limited
 thereby reducing our revenues.

We
believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all such laws and regulations and that we have obtained all material
licenses and permits that are required for the operation of our business. We are not aware of any environmental regulations that
have or that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our operations.



We
have 74 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by unions or collective bargaining agreements. Our management
believes that we maintain good working relationships with our employees. To supplement our internal sales staff
 we sometimes
engage independent national and regional sales brokers as independent contractors who work on a commission basis.


ITEM
RISK
                          FACTORS

An
investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision
 you should
carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this report.
In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below
 other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we
currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.
The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks
 and you could lose
all of your investment.

Risks
affecting our Company

Because
our business is highly dependent upon a single commodity
 coffee
 any decrease in demand for coffee could materially adversely
 Our business is centered on essentially one commodity: coffee. Our operations have
primarily focused on the following areas of the coffee industry:



    
    
the
    roasting
 blending
 packaging and distribution of private label coffee;

    
    
    

    
    
the
    roasting
 blending
 packaging and distribution of proprietary branded coffee; and

    
    
    

    
    
the
    sale of wholesale specialty green coffee.


Demand
for our products is affected by:



    
    
consumer
    tastes and preferences;

    
    
    

    
    
global
    economic conditions;

    
    
    

    
    
demographic
    trends; and

    
    
    

    
    
the
    type
 number and location of competing products.


Because
we rely on a single commodity
 any decrease in demand for coffee would harm our business more than if we had more diversified
product offerings and could materially adversely affect our revenues and operating results.

If
we are unable to geographically expand our branded and private label products
 our growth will be impeded which could result in
Our business strategy emphasizes
 among other things
 geographic expansion of our branded
and private label products as opportunities arise. We may not be able to implement successfully this portion of our business strategy.
Our ability to implement this portion of our business strategy is dependent on our ability to:


    
    




    
    
market
    our products on a national scale;

    
    
    

    
    
increase
    our brand recognition on a national scale;

    
    
    

    
    
enter
    into distribution and other strategic arrangements with third party retailers; and

    
    
    

    
    
manage
    growth in administrative overhead and distribution costs likely to result from the planned expansion of our distribution channels.


Our
sales and profitability may be adversely affected if we fail to successfully expand the geographic distribution of our branded
and private label products. In addition
 our expenses could increase and our profits could decrease as we implement our growth
strategy.

If
our hedging policy is not effective
 we may not be able to control our coffee costs
 we may be forced to pay greater than market
The supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility
and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control. We have used and expect to continue to use to a lesser extent
short-term coffee futures and options contracts for the purpose of hedging the effects of changing green coffee prices. In addition
we have acquired and expect to continue to acquire to a lesser extent futures contracts with longer terms
 generally three to
four months
 for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on options
and futures contracts are reflected in our cost of sales. Gains on options and futures contracts reduce our cost of sales and
losses on options and futures contracts increase our cost of sales.

The
use of these derivative financial instruments has generally enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices. However
 no
strategy can entirely eliminate pricing risks and we generally remain exposed to losses on futures contracts when prices decline
significantly in a short period of time
 and we would generally remain exposed to supply risk in the event of non-performance
by the counterparties to any futures contracts. Historically
 we generally have been able to pass green coffee price increases
through to customers
 thereby maintaining our gross profits
 however
 we may not be able to pass price increases through to our
customers in the future. Failure to properly design and implement an effective hedging strategy may materially adversely affect
our business and operating results. If the hedges that we enter do not adequately offset the risks of coffee bean price volatility
or our hedging results in losses
 our cost of sales may increase
 resulting in a decrease in profitability or an increase in losses.
Although we have had net gains on options and futures contracts in the past
 we have incurred losses on options and futures contracts
during some reporting periods. In these cases
 our cost of sales has increased
 resulting in a decrease in our profitability or
an increase in losses. Such losses have and could in the future materially increase our cost of sales and materially decrease
our profitability or increase losses and adversely affect our stock price.

Our
 We have
historically utilized acquisitions and joint ventures to grow our business and we intend to continue to seek opportunities for
new joint ventures and acquisitions that will be complimentary to our business. While we believe that our joint ventures will
be successful
 losses in our joint ventures or any future joint ventures would hurt our profitability. In addition
 we generally
will not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding our joint ventures. Investments in joint ventures
may under certain circumstances
 involve risks not present when a third party is not involved
 including the possibility that
joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of the required capital contributions. Joint venture
partners may have business interests
 strategies or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests
 strategies or goals
and may be
 in cases where we have a minority interest
 in a position to take actions contrary to our policies
 strategies or
objectives. Any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that
could increase our expenses and could prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort exclusively on
our business strategies. In addition
 we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party joint venture
partners.


    
    


Acquisitions
including strategic investments or alliances entail numerous risks
 which may include:



    
    
difficulties
    in integrating acquired operations or products
 including the loss of key employees from
 or customers of
 acquired businesses;

    
    
    

    
    
diversion
    of management&rsquo;s attention from our existing businesses;

    
    
    

    
    
adverse
    effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; 

    
    
    

    
    
adverse
    impacts of margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business; and 

    
    
    

    
    
risks
    of entering distribution channels
 categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience.


Our
failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business
 and any adverse consequences associated with our acquisition
activities
 could have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and operating results.

Any
inability to successfully implement our strategy of growth through selective acquisitions
 licensing arrangements and other strategic
alliances
 including joint ventures
Part of our growth strategy
utilizes the selective acquisition of coffee companies
 the selective acquisition or licensing of additional coffee brands and
other strategic alliances including joint ventures
 presents risks that could result in increased expenditures and could materially
adversely affect our revenues and profitability
 including:



    
    
such
    acquisitions
 licensing arrangements or other strategic alliances may divert our management&rsquo;s attention from our existing
    operations;

    
    
    

    
    
we
    may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired coffee companies or new coffee brands into our existing business;

    
    
    

    
    
we
    may not be able to manage the contingent risks associated with the past operations of
 and other unanticipated problems arising
    in
 any acquired coffee company; and

    
    
    

    
    
we
    may not be able to control unanticipated costs associated with such acquisitions
 licensing arrangements or strategic alliances.


In
addition
 any such acquisitions
 licensing arrangements or strategic alliances may result in:



    
    
potentially
    dilutive issuances of our equity securities;

    
    
    

    
    
the
    incurrence of additional debt

    
    
    

    
    
restructuring
    charges; and

    
    
    

    
    
the
    recognition of significant charges for depreciation and amortization related to intangible assets.


As
has been our practice in the past
 we will continuously evaluate any such acquisitions
 licensing opportunities or strategic alliances
as they arise. However
 we have not reached any new agreements or arrangements with respect to any such acquisition
 licensing
opportunity or strategic alliance (other than those described herein) at this time and we may not be able to consummate any acquisitions
licensing arrangements or strategic alliances on terms favorable to us or at all. The failure to consummate any such acquisitions
licensing arrangements or strategic alliances may reduce our growth and expansion. In addition
 if these acquisitions
 licensing
opportunities or strategic alliances are not successful
 our earnings could be materially adversely affected by increased expenses
and decreased revenues.

The
loss of any of our key customers
 We are dependent upon
sales of our products to our key customers
 including GMCR
 which accounted for approximately 8% and 29% of our net sales for
the fiscal years ended October 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively. No other customer accounted for greater than 10% of our net sales
during our 2017 and 2016 fiscal years. We generally do not enter long-term contracts with our customers that are material to our
business. Accordingly
 some of our customers can stop purchasing our products at any time without penalty and are free to purchase
products from our competitors. The loss of
 or reduction in sales to any of our other customers to which we sell a significant
amount of our products or any material adverse change in the financial condition of such customers would negatively affect our
revenues and decrease our earnings.


    
    


If
we lose our key personnel
 including Andrew Gordon and David Gordon
 Our
success depends to a large degree upon the services of Andrew Gordon
 our President
 Chief Executive Officer
 Chief Financial
Officer and Treasurer
 and David Gordon
 our Executive Vice President &ndash; Operations and Secretary. We also depend to a large
degree on the expertise of our coffee roasters. We do not have employment contracts with our coffee roasters. Our ability to source
and purchase a sufficient supply of high quality coffee beans and to roast coffee beans consistent with our quality standards
could suffer if we lose the services of any of these individuals. As a result
 our business and operating results would be adversely
affected. We may not be successful in obtaining and retaining a replacement for either Andrew Gordon or David Gordon if they elect
to stop working for us. In addition
 we do not have key-person insurance on the lives of Andrew Gordon or David Gordon.

Our
indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional funds and may increase our vulnerability to economic or business
From time to time
 we utilize borrowings under our credit facility in connection with operations. Outstanding
debt could have important negative consequences to the holders of our securities
 including the following:



    
    
general
    domestic and global economic conditions;

    
    
    

    
    
a
    portion of our cash flow from operations will be needed to pay debt service and will not be available to fund future operations;

    
    
    

    
    
we
    have increased vulnerability to adverse general economic and coffee industry conditions;

    
    
    

    
    
we
    may be vulnerable to higher interest rates because interest expense on borrowings under our revolving line of credit is based
    on variable rates; and

    
    
    

    
    
we
    may be subject to covenants that could restrict our operations.


Our
ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations depends on our ability to generate cash in the future.
Our future operating performance is subject to market conditions and business factors that are beyond our control. If our cash
flows and capital resources are insufficient to allow us to make scheduled payments on our debt
 we may have to reduce or delay
capital expenditures
 sell assets
 seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt.

Our
credit facility contains covenants that place annual restrictions on our operations
 including covenants relating to debt restrictions
capital expenditures
 minimum deposit restrictions
 tangible net worth
 net profit
 leverage
 employee loan restrictions
 distribution
restrictions (common stock and preferred stock)
 dividend restrictions and restrictions on intercompany transactions. The credit
facility also requires that we maintain a minimum working capital at all times. There can be no assurance that we will be in compliance
with all covenants in the future or that we will be able to modify the terms of the credit facility should that become necessary.
Failure to comply with any of these covenants and restrictions would result in an event of default under the loan agreement.

If
we fail to promote
 enhance and maintain our brands
 the value of our brands could decrease and our revenues and profitability
 We believe that promoting and enhancing our brands is critical to our success. If our brand-building
strategy is unsuccessful
 these expenses may never be recovered
 and we may be unable to increase awareness of our brands or protect
the value of our brands. If we are unable to achieve these goals
 our revenues and ability to implement our business strategy
could be adversely affected.

Our
success in promoting and enhancing our brands will also depend on our ability to provide customers with high quality products
and service. Although we take measures to ensure that we sell only fresh roasted coffee
 we have no control over our roasted coffee
products once they are purchased by our customers. Accordingly
 wholesale customers may store our coffee for longer periods of
time or resell our coffee without our consent
 in each case
 potentially affecting the quality of the coffee prepared from our
products. Although we believe we are less susceptible to quality control problems than many of our competitors because our products
are processed in-house under strict quality control guidelines which have been in place for more than 30 years
 if consumers do
not perceive our products and service to be of high quality
 then the value of our brands may be diminished and
 consequently
our operating results and ability to implement our business strategy may be adversely affected.


    
    


Our
roasting methods are not proprietary
 so competitors may be able to duplicate them
 which could harm our competitive position.
If our competitive position is weakened
 We consider
our roasting methods essential to the flavor and richness of our roasted coffee and
 therefore
 essential to our brands of coffee.
Because we do not hold any patents for our roasting methods
 it may be difficult for us to prevent competitors from copying our
roasting methods if such methods become known. If our competitors copy our roasting methods
 the value of our coffee brands may
be diminished
 and we may lose customers to our competitors. In addition
 competitors may be able to develop roasting methods
that are more advanced than our roasting methods
 which may also harm our competitive position.

The
success of our brand also depends in part on our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of trademarks
 copyrights
 service
marks
 trade secrets and similar rights to protect our intellectual property. The success of our growth strategy depends on our
continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our
brand in both domestic and international markets. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate
 or if
any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property
 the value of our brand may be harmed
 which could have
a material adverse effect on our business. We may become engaged in litigation to protect our intellectual property
 which could
result in substantial costs to us as well as diversion of management attention.

Since
we rely heavily on common carriers to ship our coffee on a daily basis
 any disruption in their services or increase in shipping
costs could adversely affect our relationship with our customers
 which could result in reduced revenues
 increased operating
expenses
 We rely on a number of common carriers to deliver coffee to our
customers and to deliver coffee beans to us. We have no control over these common carriers and the services provided by them may
be interrupted as a result of labor shortages
 contract disputes and other factors. If we experience an interruption in these
services
 we may be unable to ship our coffee in a timely manner
 which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our relationship
with our customers. In addition
 a delay in shipping could require us to contract with alternative
 and possibly more expensive
common carriers and could cause orders to be cancelled or receipt of goods to be refused. Any significant increase in shipping
costs could lower our profit margins or force us to raise prices
 which could cause our revenue and profits to suffer.

If
there was a significant interruption in the operation of our Colorado
 Ohio or Massachusetts facilities
 we may not have
the capacity to service all of our customers and we may not be able to service our customers in a timely manner
 thereby reducing
 We are dependent on the continued operations of our Colorado and Massachusetts coffee roasting
and distribution facilities. Our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications equipment in effective working order
and to protect against damage from fire
 natural disaster
 power loss
 telecommunications failure or similar events. In addition
growth of our customer base may strain or exceed the capacity of our systems and lead to degradations in performance or systems
failure. Although we continually review and consider upgrades to our order fulfillment infrastructure and provide for system redundancies
to limit the likelihood of systems overload or failure
 substantial damage to our systems or a systems failure that causes interruptions
for a number of days could adversely affect our business. Additionally
 if we are unsuccessful in updating and expanding our order
fulfillment infrastructure
 our ability to grow may be constrained. As a result
 our revenues and earnings could be materially
adversely affected.

Risks
related to the coffee industry

Increases
 Green coffee is
our largest single cost of sales. Coffee is a traded commodity and
 in general
 its price can fluctuate depending on:



    
    
weather
    patterns in coffee-producing countries;

    
    
    

    
    
economic
    and political conditions affecting coffee-producing countries
 including acts of terrorism in such countries;

    
    
    

    
    
foreign
    currency fluctuations; and

    
    
    

    
    
trade
    regulations and restrictions between coffee-producing countries and the United States.



    
    



If
the cost of wholesale green coffee increases due to any of these factors
 our margins could decrease and our profitability could
suffer accordingly. It is expected that coffee prices will remain volatile in the coming years. Although we have historically
attempted to raise the selling prices of our products in response to increases in the price of wholesale green coffee
 when wholesale
green coffee prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than normal levels
 we are not always able to pass the price increases
through to our customers on a timely basis
 if at all
 which adversely affects our operating margins and cash flow. We may not
be able to recover any future increases in the cost of wholesale green coffee. Even if we are able to recover future increases
our operating margins and results of operations may still be materially and adversely affected by time delays in the implementation
of price increases.

Disruptions
in the supply of green coffee could result in a deterioration of our relationship with our customers
 decreased revenues or could
 Green coffee is a commodity and its supply is subject to volatility beyond our
control. Supply is affected by many factors in the coffee growing countries including weather
 pest damage
 economic conditions
acts of terrorism
 as well as efforts by coffee growers to expand or form cartels or associations. In addition
 the political
situation in many of the Arabica coffee growing regions
 including Africa
 Indonesia
 and Central and South America
 can be unstable
and such instability could affect our ability to purchase coffee from those regions. If Arabica coffee beans from a region become
unavailable or prohibitively expensive
 we could be forced to discontinue particular coffee types and blends or substitute coffee
beans from other regions in our blends. Frequent substitutions and changes in our coffee product lines could lead to cost increases
customer alienation and fluctuations in our gross margins.

Some
of the Arabica coffee beans of the quality we purchase do not trade directly on the commodity markets. Rather
 we purchase the
high-end Arabica coffee beans that we use on a negotiated basis. We depend on our relationships with coffee brokers
 exporters
and growers for the supply of our primary raw material
 high quality Arabica coffee beans. If any of our relationships with coffee
brokers
 exporters or growers deteriorate
 we may be unable to procure a sufficient quantity of high quality coffee beans at prices
acceptable to us or at all. In such case
 we may not be able to fulfill the demand of our existing customers
 supply new retail
stores or expand other channels of distribution. A raw material shortage could result in a deterioration of our relationship with
our customers
 decreased revenues or could impair our ability to expand our business.

The
coffee industry is highly competitive and if we cannot compete successfully
 we may lose our customers or experience reduced sales
 The coffee markets in which we do business are highly competitive and competition in these markets
could become increasingly more intense due to the relatively low barriers of entry. The industry in which we compete is particularly
sensitive to price pressure
 as well as quality
 reputation and viability for wholesale and brand loyalty for retail. To the extent
that one or more of our competitors becomes more successful with respect to any key competitive factor
 our ability to attract
and retain customers could be materially adversely affected. Our private label and branded coffee products compete with other
manufacturers of private label coffee and branded coffees. These competitors
 such as Kraft General Foods
 Inc. (owner of the
Maxwell House brand)
 J.M. Smucker Co. (owner of the Folgers and Caf&eacute; Bustelo brands)
 and Massimo Zanetti Beverage Group
have much greater financial
 marketing
 distribution
 management and other resources than we do for marketing
 promotions and
geographic and market expansion. In addition
 there are a growing number of specialty coffee companies who provide specialty green
coffee and roasted coffee for retail sale. If we are unable to compete successfully against existing and new competitors
 we may
lose our customers or experience reduced sales and profitability.

Besides
coffee
 we face exposure to other commodity cost fluctuations
In addition to the
increase in coffee costs discussed in the risk factor above
 we are exposed to cost fluctuation in other commodities
 including
in particular
 steel
 natural gas and gasoline. In addition
 an increase in the cost of fuel could indirectly lead to higher electricity
costs
 transportation costs and other commodity costs. Much like coffee costs
 the costs of these commodities depend on various
factors beyond our control
 including economic and political conditions
 foreign currency fluctuations
 and global weather patterns.
To the extent we are unable to pass along such costs to our customers through price increases
 our margins and profitability will
decrease.

Adverse
Coffee contains caffeine and other active compounds
 the
health effects of some of which are not fully understood. A number of research studies conclude or suggest that excessive consumption
of caffeine may lead to increased heart rate
 nausea and vomiting
 restlessness and anxiety
 depression
 headaches
 tremors
 sleeplessness
and other adverse health effects. An unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in coffee
could significantly reduce the demand for coffee
 which could harm our business and reduce our sales and profits. In addition
we could become subject to litigation relating to the existence of such compounds in our coffee; litigation that could be costly
and could divert management attention.

Our
operating results may fluctuate significantly
 which makes our results of operations difficult to predict and could cause our
 Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year
to year as a result of a number of factors
 many of which are outside of our control. These fluctuations could be caused by a

    ability to manage inventory and fulfillment operations and maintain gross margins.


As
a result of the foregoing
 period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and those comparisons
should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Accordingly
 our operating results in future quarters may be below
market expectations. In this event
 the price of our common stock may decline.

The
Members of the Gordon family
 including
Andrew Gordon
 our President
 Chief Executive Officer
 Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
 and David Gordon
 our Executive
Vice President and Secretary
 own
 in the aggregate
 approximately 11.9% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result
the Gordon family is able to influence the actions that require stockholder approval
 including:



    
    
the
    election of a majority of our directors;

    
    
    

    
    
the
    amendment of our charter documents; and

    
    
    

    
    
the
    approval of mergers
 sales of assets or other corporate transactions or matters submitted for stockholder approval.


As
a result
 our other stockholders may have reduced influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval. In addition
 the
Gordon family&rsquo;s influence could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of us and consequently materially adversely affect
the price of our common stock.

The
 The market price and
trading volume of our common stock has been volatile over the past year and it may continue to be volatile. Over the past year
our common stock has traded as low as $3.76 and as high as $5.68 per share. We cannot predict the price at which our common stock
will trade in the future and it may decline. The price at which our common stock trades may fluctuate significantly and may be
influenced by many factors
 including our financial results
 developments generally affecting the coffee industry
 general economic
industry and market conditions
 the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock
 fluctuations in coffee prices
 investor
perceptions of our business
 reports by industry analysts
 negative announcements by our customers
 competitors or suppliers regarding
their own performances
 and the impact of other &ldquo;Risk Factors&rdquo; discussed in this Annual Report.

Provisions
in our articles of incorporation
 bylaws and of Nevada law have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control that
could be beneficial to our stockholders
Our articles
of incorporation
 bylaws and Nevada corporate law contain provisions that could delay
 defer or prevent a change in control of
us or our management that could be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make
it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions might also discourage
a potential acquisition proposal or tender offer
 even if the acquisition proposal or tender offer is at a price above the then
current market price for shares of our common stock. These provisions:


    
    




    
    
provide
    that directors may only be removed upon a vote of at least eighty percent of the shares outstanding;

    
    
    

    
    
establish
    advance notice requirements for nominating directors and proposing matters to be voted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings;

    
    
    

    
    
limit
    the right of our stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;

    
    
    

    
    
authorize
    our board of directors to issue preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of those shares
 which would be
    senior to our common stock
 without prior stockholder approval;

    
    
    

    
    
require
    amendments to our articles of incorporation to be approved by the holders of at least eighty percent of our outstanding shares
    of common stock;

    
    
    

    
    
a
    classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms
 which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership
    of a majority of our board of directors; and

    
    
    

    
    
provide
    a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent
 thereby only permitting stockholder action to be taken at an annual
    or special meeting of our stockholders.


We
are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under Nevada law. Under Nevada law
 a corporation may not
 in general
 engage
in a business combination with any &ldquo;interested stockholder&rdquo; for two (2) years after the date the person first became
an interested stockholder
 unless the combination meets all of the requirements of our articles of incorporation and (i) the purchase
of shares by the interested stockholder is approved by our board of directors before that date or (ii) the combination is approved
by our board of directors and
 at or after that time
 the combination is approved at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders
and not by written consent
 by the affirmative vote of the holders of stock representing at least sixty percent (60%) of our outstanding
voting power not beneficially owned by the interested stockholder or the affiliates or associates of the interested stockholder.

MANAGEMENT&rsquo;S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Cautionary
Note on Forward-Looking Statements

expectations and projections about future events
 including
 among other things:



    
    
our
    dependency on a single commodity could affect our revenues and profitability;

    
    
our
    success in expanding our market presence in new geographic regions;

    
    
the
    effectiveness of our hedging policy may impact our profitability;

    
    
the
    success of our joint ventures;

    
    
our
    success in implementing our business strategy or introducing new products;

    
    
our
    ability to attract and retain customers;

    
    
our
    ability to obtain additional financing;

    ability to comply with the restrictive covenants we are subject to under our current financing;

    
    
the
    effects of competition from other coffee manufacturers and other beverage alternatives;

    
    
the
    impact to the operations of our Colorado facility;

    
    
general
    economic conditions and conditions which affect the market for coffee;

    
    
the
    macro global economic environment;

    
    
our
    ability to maintain and develop our brand recognition;

    
    
the
    impact of rapid or persistent fluctuations in the price of coffee beans;

    
    
fluctuations
    in the supply of coffee beans;

    
    
the
    volatility of our common stock; and

    
    
other
    risks which we identify in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;SEC&rdquo;).


In
some cases
 you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as &ldquo;may
&rdquo; &ldquo;should
&rdquo; &ldquo;could
&rdquo;
&ldquo;predict
&rdquo; &ldquo;potential
&rdquo; &ldquo;continue

&rdquo; &ldquo;estimate&rdquo; and similar expressions (or the negative
of such expressions). Any or all of our forward looking statements in this annual report and in any other public statements we
make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
Consequently
 no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. In addition
 we undertake no responsibility to update any forward-looking
statement to reflect events or circumstances
 that occur after the date of this annual report.


    
    




We
are an integrated wholesale coffee roaster and dealer in the United States and one of the few coffee companies that offers a broad
array of coffee products across the entire spectrum of consumer tastes
 preferences and price points. As a result
 we believe
that we are well-positioned to increase our profitability and endure potential coffee price volatility throughout varying cycles
of the coffee market and economic conditions.

Our
operations have primarily focused on the following areas of the coffee industry:



    
    
the
    sale of wholesale specialty green coffee;

    
    
the
    roasting
 blending
 packaging and sale of private label coffee;

    
    
the
    roasting
 blending
 packaging and sale of our eight brands of coffee; and

    
    
sales
    of our tabletop coffee roasting equipment.


Our
operating results are affected by a number of factors including:



    
    
the
    level of marketing and pricing competition from existing or new competitors in the coffee industry;

    
    
our
    ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers;

    
    
our
    hedging policy;

    
    
fluctuations
    in purchase prices and supply of green coffee and in the selling prices of our products; and

    
    
our
    ability to manage inventory and fulfillment operations and maintain gross margins.


Our
net sales are driven primarily by the success of our sales and marketing efforts and our ability to retain existing customers
and attract new customers. For this reason
 we have made
 and will continue to evaluate
 strategic decisions to invest in measures
that are expected to increase net sales. These transactions include our acquisition of Premier Roasters
 LLC
 including equipment
and a roasting facility in La Junta
 Colorado
 the addition of a west coast sales manager to increase sales of our private label
and branded coffees to new customers
 our joint venture with Caruso&rsquo;s Coffee
 Inc. of Brecksville
 Ohio
 the transaction
with OPTCO
 the transaction with Sonofresco and the transaction with Comfort Foods. We believe these efforts will allow us to
expand or business.

Our
net sales are affected by the price of green coffee. We purchase our green coffee from dealers located primarily within the United
States. The dealers supply us with coffee beans from many countries
 including Colombia
 Mexico
 Kenya
 Indonesia
 Brazil and
Uganda. The supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond
our control. For example
 in Brazil
 which produces approximately 40% of the world&rsquo;s green coffee
 the coffee crops are
historically susceptible to frost in June and July and drought in September
 October and November. However
 because we purchase
coffee from a number of countries and are able to freely substitute one country&rsquo;s coffee for another in our products
 price
fluctuations in one country generally have not had a material impact on the price we pay for coffee. Accordingly
 price fluctuations
in one country generally have not had a material effect on our results of operations
 liquidity and capital resources. Historically
because we generally have been able to pass green coffee price increases through to customers
 increased prices of green coffee
generally result in increased net sales.

The
supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control.
Historically
 we have used
 and intend to continue to use in a limited capacity
 short-term coffee futures and options contracts
primarily for the purpose of partially hedging the effects of changing green coffee prices
 as further explained in Note 2 of
the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report. In addition
 we acquired
 and expect to continue
to acquire
 futures contracts with longer terms
 generally three to four months
 primarily for the purpose of guaranteeing an
adequate supply of green coffee. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on options and futures contracts are reflected in our
cost of sales. Gains on options and futures contracts reduce our cost of sales and losses on options and futures contracts increase
our cost of sales. The use of these derivative financial instruments has generally enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing
prices. We believe that
 in normal economic times
 our hedging policies remain a vital element to our business model not only
in controlling our cost of sales
 but also giving us the flexibility to obtain the inventory necessary to continue to grow our
sales while trying to minimize margin compression during a time of historically high coffee prices. However
 no strategy can entirely
eliminate pricing risks and we generally remain exposed to losses on futures contracts when prices decline significantly in a
short period of time
 and we would generally remain exposed to supply risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparties
to any of our futures contracts. Although we have had net gains on options and futures contracts in the past
 we have incurred
significant losses on options and futures contracts during some recent reporting periods. In these cases
 our cost of sales has
increased
 resulting in a decrease in our profitability or increase our losses. Such losses have and could in the future materially
increase our cost of sales and materially decrease our profitability and adversely affect our stock price. See &ldquo;Item 1A
&ndash; Risk Factors - If our hedging policy is not effective
 we may not be able to control our coffee costs
 we may be forced
to pay greater than market value for green coffee and our profitability may be reduced.&rdquo; Failure to properly design and
implement an effective hedging strategy may materially adversely affect our business and operating results. If the hedges that
we enter do not adequately offset the risks of coffee bean price volatility or our hedges result in losses
 our cost of sales
may increase
 resulting in a decrease in profitability or increased losses. As previously announced
 as a result of the volatile
nature of the commodities markets
 we have and are continuing to scale back our use of hedging and short-term trading of coffee
futures and options contracts
 and intend to continue to use these practices in a limited capacity going forward.


    
    


Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (&ldquo;U.S. GAAP&rdquo;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for
 but not limited to
 the accounting for the
allowance for doubtful accounts
 inventories
 assets held for sale
 income taxes
 commodities held and loss contingencies. Management
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We
believe the following critical accounting policies
 among others
 may be impacted significantly by judgment
 assumptions and estimates
used in the preparation of the financial statements:



    
    
We
    recognize revenue in accordance with the relevant authoritative guidance. Revenue is recognized at the point title and risk
    of ownership transfers to its customers which is upon the shippers taking possession of the goods because i) title passes
    in accordance with the terms of the purchase orders and with our agreements with our customers
 ii) any risk of loss is covered
    by the customers&rsquo; insurance
 iii) there is persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement
 iv) the sales price is determinable
    and v) collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Thus
 revenue is recognized at the point of shipment.

    
    
    

    
    
Our
    allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to provide for losses arising from customers&rsquo; inability to make required
    payments. If there is deterioration of our customers&rsquo; credit worthiness and/or there is an increase in the length of
    time that the receivables are past due greater than the historical assumptions used
 additional allowances may be required.
    For example
 every additional one percent of our accounts receivable that becomes uncollectible
 would decrease our operating
    income by approximately $134
000 for the year ended October 31
 2017. The reserve for sales discounts represents the estimated
    discount that customers will take upon payment. The reserve for other allowances represents the estimated amount of returns
    slotting fees and volume based discounts estimated to be incurred by us from our customers.

    
    
    

    
    
Inventories
    are stated at lower of cost (determined on a first-in
 first-out basis) or market. Based on our assumptions about future demand
    and market conditions
 inventories are subject to be written-down to market value. If our assumptions about future demand
    change and/or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected
 additional write-downs of inventories may
    be required. Each additional one percent of potential inventory write-down would have decreased operating income by approximately
    $163
000 for the year ended October 31
 2017.

    
    
    

    
    
The
    commodities held at broker represent the market value of the Company&rsquo;s trading account
 which consists of option and
    futures contracts for coffee held with a brokerage firm. We use options and futures contracts
 which are not designated or
    qualifying as hedging instruments
 to partially hedge the effects of fluctuations in the price of green coffee beans. Options
    and futures contracts are recognized at fair value in the consolidated financial statements with current recognition of gains
    and losses on such positions. We classify options and futures contracts as trading securities and accordingly
 unrealized
    holding gains and losses are included in earnings. We record realized and unrealized gains and losses in our cost of sales
    in the statement of operations/income.

    
    
    

    
    
We
    account for income taxes in accordance with the relevant authoritative guidance. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed
    for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable
    or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected
    to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reflected on the balance sheet when it is determined that it is more likely than not that
    the asset will be realized.

    
    
    

    
    
Our
    goodwill consists of the cost in excess of the fair market value of the acquired net assets of OPTCO
 Sonofresco and Comfort
    Foods
 which has been integrated into a structure that does not provide the basis for separate reporting units. Consequently
    we are a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes. We also have intangible assets consisting of our
    customer lists and relationships and trademarks acquired from OPTCO
 Sonofresco and Comfort Foods. At October 31
 2017 our
    balance sheet reflected goodwill and intangible assets as set forth below:

Goodwill
and the trademarks which are deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests. Goodwill impairment tests
require the comparison of the fair value and carrying value of reporting units. We assess the potential impairment of goodwill
and intangible assets annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable. Upon completion of such review
 if impairment is found to have occurred
 a corresponding charge
will be recorded. The value assigned to the customer list and relationships is being amortized over a twenty year period.

Because
the Company is a single reporting unit
 the closing NASDAQ Capital Market price of our common stock as of the acquisition date
was used as a basis to measure the fair value of goodwill. Goodwill and the intangible assets will be tested annually at the end
of each fiscal year to determine whether they have been impaired. Upon completion of each annual review
 there can be no assurance
that a material charge will not be recorded. Impairment testing is required more often than annually if an event or circumstance
indicates that an impairment or decline in value may have occurred.

Year
Ended October 31
 2017 (Fiscal Year 2017) Compared to the Year Ended October 31
 2016 (Fiscal Year 2016)

Net
 Net sales totaled $77
127
595 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2017
 a decrease of $1
820
633
 or 2.3%
 from
$78
948
228 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2016. The decrease in net sales reflects reduced wholesale transactions with
our largest wholesale green coffee customer during fiscal 2017 of approximately $16
775
000
 partially offset by increased sales
to both new and existing customers  including a fourth quarter increase in revenues of $4
300
000 or 25.0%.

Cost
 Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2017 was $64
977
632
 or 84.3% of net sales
 as compared
to $67
066
050
 or 85.0% of net sales
 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2016. Cost of sales consists primarily of the cost
of green coffee and packaging materials and realized and unrealized gains or losses on hedging activity. The decrease in cost
of sales reflects the change in the product mix due to our reduced wholesale transactions with our largest wholesale green coffee
customer.

Gross
 Gross profit for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2017 was $12
149
963
 an increase of $267
785 from $11
882
178
for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 15.8% for the fiscal year ended
October 31
 2017 from 15.0% for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2016. Although we experienced improved margins on our wholesale
and roasted business during the year our margins have not increased as expected due to our integration of our acquisition of Comfort
Foods and reduced profitability of our OPTCO subsidiary.


    
    


Operating
 Total operating expenses increased by $2
908
136 to $10
927
246 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2017 from
$8
019
110 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2016. Selling and administrative expenses increased $2
864
796
 or 39.0%
 to
$10
228
506 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2017 from $7
363
710 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2016. The primary
reasons for this increase were the acquisition of Comfort Foods
 the full year of integration of Sonofresco and the increase in
our freight costs as we increased and expanded our product distribution. Officers&rsquo; salary increased by $43
340 or 6.6%
to $698
740 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2017 from $655
400 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2016.

Other
 Other expense for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2017 was $245
781
 an increase of $98
675 from $147
106
for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2016. The increase in other expense was attributable to an increase in interest expense
of $76
951 and a decrease in interest income of $21
740
 partially offset by a decrease in our loss from our equity investments
of $16
 during the fiscal year ended October 31
 2017.

Income
 We had income of $976
936 before income taxes and non-controlling
interest in subsidiary for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2017 compared to income of $3
715
962 for the fiscal year ended October
31
 2016
 resulting in a net change of $2
739
026 for the year ended October 31
 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable
to the reasons described above.

Income
 Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2017 totaled $244
096 compared to a provision
of $1
365
920 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2016. The change was attributable to the difference in the gain for the year
ended October 31
 2017 versus fiscal year ended October 31
 2016. The Company&rsquo;s effective tax rate for the year ended October
31
 2017 was 34.0% compared to 37.0% for the year ended October 31
 2016.

Net
 We had net income of $467
262 or $0.08 per share basic and diluted
 for the fiscal year ended October 31
2017 compared to a net income of $2
212
288
 or $0.36 per share basic and diluted for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2016.
The decrease in net income was due primarily to the reasons described above.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

As
of October 31
 2017
 we had working capital of $20
605
400
 which represented a $1
064
042 decrease from our working capital of
$21
669
442 as of October 31
 2016
 and total stockholders&rsquo; equity of $24
951
549 which increased by $412
346 from our total
stockholders&rsquo; equity of $24
539
203 as of October 31
 2016. Our working capital decreased primarily due to decreases of
$902
331 in cash
 $76
090 in accounts receivable
 $264
227 in prepaid green coffee
 $9
163 in prepaid and refundable income taxes
$345
584 in due from broker
 an increase of $368
053 in accounts payable and accrued expenses
 $1
449
152 in our line of credit
$296 in income taxes payable
 partially offset by increases of $2
034
282 in inventory
 $58
369 in prepaid expenses and other
current assets and $258
203 deferred income tax asset. As of October 31
 2017
 the outstanding balance on our line of credit was
$8
407
527 compared to $6
958
375 as of October 31
 2016. Total stockholders&rsquo; equity increased due to our net income
 partially
offset by our Share Repurchase Program.

On
April 25
 2017
 the Company and OPTCO (together with the Company
 collectively referred to herein as the &ldquo;Borrowers&rdquo;)
entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the &ldquo;A&amp;R Loan Agreement&rdquo;) with Sterling
 which
consolidated the Company Financing Agreement and the OPTCO Financing Agreement.

Pursuant
to the A&amp;R Loan Agreement
 the terms of each of the Company Financing Agreement and the OPTCO Financing Agreement were amended
and restated to
 among other things: (i) provide for a new Maturity Date of February 28
 2018; (ii) consolidate the principal
amounts of the Company Financing Agreement and the OPTCO Financing Agreement to provide for a maximum principal amount limit of
$12
000
000 for the Borrowers
 collectively
 OPTCO is limited to a $3
000
000 maximum principal amount sublimit;
(iii) expand the borrowing base to include
 along with 85% of eligible accounts receivable
 up to the lesser of $2
000
000 as
to the Company and $1
500
000 as to OPTCO; (iv) effective March 1
 2017
 converted the interest rate on the average unpaid balance
of the A&amp;R Loan Facility from an interest rate per annum equal to the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate to an interest rate per
annum equal to the sum of the LIBOR rate plus 2.4%; (v) require the Company and OPTCO to pay
 collectively
 upon the occurrence
of certain termination events
 a prepayment premium of 1.0% (as opposed to the 0.5% under the OPTCO Financing Agreement) of the
maximum amount of the A&amp;R Loan Facility in effect as of the date of the termination event; (vi) eliminate the overadvance
fee; and (vii) establish a Letter of Credit Facility (as defined in the A&amp;R Loan Agreement) with a maximum obligation amount
of $1
000
000
 and subject to other terms and conditions described therein. The Company is currently negotiating the terms
of a new facility with Sterling and the Company expects to enter into a new facility on or before February 28
 2018 or extend
the line further until the terms of the new facility have been finalized.




    
    



Also
on April 25
 2017
 SONO and CFI (collectively referred to herein as the &ldquo;Guarantors&rdquo;)
 entered into a Guaranty Agreement
(the &ldquo;Guaranty Agreement&rdquo;) in connection with the A&amp;R Loan Agreement. The Guaranty Agreement was provided as an
inducement to Sterling to extend credit to Borrowers in exchange for the Guarantors&rsquo; unconditional guarantee of the payment
and performance obligations of the Borrowers under the A&amp;R Loan Agreement
 as further defined in the Guaranty Agreement.

Each
of the Company Loan Facility and A&amp;R Loan Agreement contains covenants
 subject to certain exceptions
 that place annual restrictions
on the Borrowers&rsquo; operations
 including covenants relating to debt restrictions
 capital expenditures
 indebtedness
 minimum
deposit restrictions
 tangible net worth
 net profit
 leverage
 employee loan restrictions
 dividend and repurchase restrictions
(common stock and preferred stock)
 and restrictions on intercompany transactions. The Loan Facility also requires that we maintain
a minimum working capital at all times
 and the A&amp;R Loan Agreement requires that the Borrowers
 on a consolidated basis
 maintain
a minimum working capital at all times and achieve a minimum net profit amount as of fiscal year end during the term of the A&amp;R
Loan Agreement. The Company and OPTCO
 as applicable were in compliance with all required financial covenants at October 31
 2017
and 2016.

Each
of the Company Loan Facility and the A&amp;R Loan Agreement is secured by all tangible and intangible assets of the Company. Other
than as amended and restated by the A&amp;R Loan Agreement
 the Company Financing Agreement and the OPTCO Financing Agreement
remains in full force and effect.

As
of October 31
 2017 and 2016
 the outstanding balance under the bank line of credit was $8
407
527 and $6
958
375
 respectively.

For
the fiscal year ended October 31
 2017
 our operating activities provided net cash of $1
476
633 as compared to the fiscal year
ended October 31
 2016 when operating activities provided net cash of $1
607
788. The decreased cash flow from operations for
the fiscal year ended October 31
 2017 was primarily due to our net income.

For
the fiscal year ended October 31
 2017
 our investing activities used net cash of $3
573
196 as compared to the fiscal year ended
October 31
 2016 when net cash used by investing activities was $1
782
999. The increase in our uses of cash in investing activities
was due to our increased outlays for the acquisition of our subsidiary
 partially offset by the decrease in outlays for equipment
during the fiscal year ended October 31
 2017.

For
the fiscal year ended October 31
 2017
 our financing activities provided net cash of $1
194
232 compared to net cash used in
financing activities of $450
624 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2016. The change in cash flow from financing activities
for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2017 was due to our decreased purchases of treasury stock.

We
expect to fund our operations
 including paying our liabilities
 funding capital expenditures and making required payments on
our indebtedness
 through October 31
 2017 with cash provided by operating activities and the use of our credit facility. In addition
an increase in eligible accounts receivable and inventory would permit us to make additional borrowings under our line of credit.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition
 changes in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures or capital
resources that is material to investors.


    
    





ITEM
    7A.
QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK


Market
risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and commodity prices as further described below.

Interest
 We are subject to market risk from exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. As of October 31
 2017
 our
debt consisted of $8
407
527 of variable rate debt under our revolving line of credit. Our line of credit provides for a maximum
of $12
000
000 and is payable monthly in arrears on the average unpaid balance of the line of credit at an interest rate equal
to a per annum reference rate (currently 3.6%). This loan is secured by all tangible and intangible assets of the Company.

Commodity
 The supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which
are beyond our control. Historically
 we have used
 and intend to continue to use in a limited capacity
 short-term coffee futures
and options contracts primarily for the purpose of partially hedging the effects of changing green coffee prices
 as further explained
in Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report. In addition
 we acquired
 and expect
to continue to acquire
 futures contracts with longer terms
 generally three to four months
 primarily for the purpose of guaranteeing
an adequate supply of green coffee. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on options and futures contracts are reflected in
our cost of sales. Gains on options and futures contracts reduce our cost of sales and losses on options and futures contracts
increase our cost of sales. The use of these derivative financial instruments has generally enabled us to mitigate the effect
of changing prices. We believe that
 in normal economic times
 our hedging policies remain a vital element to our business model
not only in controlling our cost of sales
 but also giving us the flexibility to obtain the inventory necessary to continue to
grow our sales while trying to minimize margin compression during a time of historically high coffee prices. However
 no strategy
can entirely eliminate pricing risks and we generally remain exposed to losses on futures contracts when prices decline significantly
in a short period of time
 and we would generally remain exposed to supply risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparties
to any of our futures contracts. Although we have had net gains on options and futures contracts in the past
 we have incurred
significant losses on options and futures contracts during some reporting periods. In these cases
 our cost of sales has increased
resulting in a decrease in our profitability or increase our losses. Such losses have and could in the future materially increase
our cost of sales and materially decrease our profitability and adversely affect our stock price. See &ldquo;Item 1A &ndash; Risk
Factors - If our hedging policy is not effective
 we may not be able to control our coffee costs
 we may be forced to pay greater
than market value for green coffee and our profitability may be reduced.&rdquo; Failure to properly design and implement an effective
hedging strategy may materially adversely affect our business and operating results. If the hedges that we enter do not adequately
offset the risks of coffee bean price volatility or our hedges result in losses
 our cost of sales may increase
 resulting in
a decrease in profitability or increased losses. As previously announced
 as a result of the volatile nature of the commodities
markets
 we have and are continuing to scale back our use of hedging and short-term trading of coffee futures and options contracts
and intend to continue to use these practices in a limited capacity going forward. See &ldquo;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk&mdash;Commodity Price Risks.&rdquo;

As
of October 31
 2017
 we held 145 futures contracts for the purchase of 5
437
500 pounds of green coffee at a weighted average
price of $1.31 per pound compared to 22 futures contracts for the purchase of 825
000 pounds of coffee at a weighted average price
of $1.45 per pound for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2016. The fair market value of coffee applicable to such contracts was
$1.25 and $1.64 per pound
 respectively.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES


Evaluation
 Management
 which includes our President
 Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer
 has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;)) as of the end of the period covered by this
report. Based upon that evaluation
 our President
 Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file and submit
under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported as and when required and (ii) accumulated and communicated
as is appropriate
 to our management
 including its principal executive officer and financial officer to allow timely decisions
regarding disclosure.

Management
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

Our
internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in
reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets
 provide reasonable assurances that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP
 and that receipts and expenditures
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and the directors
 and provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect
on our financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of October 31
 2017. In making this
assessment
 management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment our management believes that
 as of October 31
 2017
 our internal
control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred
during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected
 or that is reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control
over financial reporting.

Attestation
Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
financial reporting. Management&rsquo;s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant
to section 989G of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that permits us to provide only management&rsquo;s
report in this annual report.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Audit Committee of the
Board
of Directors and Shareholders
Coffee
Holding Co.
 Inc. and Subsidiaries

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Coffee Holding Co.
 Inc. and Subsidiaries (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;)
as of October 31
 2017 and 2016 and the related consolidated statements of income
 changes in stockholders&rsquo; equity
and cash flows for each of the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit
also includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion
 the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position
of Coffee Holding Co.
 Inc. and Subsidiaries as of October 31
 2017 and 2016
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for the years then ended
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

COFFEE
HOLDING CO.
 INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OCTOBER

 2017 AND 2016

NOTE
1 - BUSINESS ACTIVITIES:

Coffee
Holding Co.
 Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) conducts wholesale coffee operations
 including manufacturing
 roasting
 packaging
marketing and distributing roasted and blended coffees for private labeled accounts and its own brands
 and it sells green coffee.
The Company&rsquo;s core product
 coffee
 can be summarized and divided into three product categories (&ldquo;product lines&rdquo;)
as follows:

Wholesale
 unroasted raw beans imported from around the world and sold to large and small roasters and coffee shop
operators;

Private
 coffee roasted
 blended
 packaged and sold under the specifications and names of others
 including supermarkets
that want to have their own brand name on coffee to compete with national brands; and

Branded
 coffee roasted and blended to the Company&rsquo;s own specifications and packaged and sold under the Company&rsquo;s
seven proprietary and licensed brand names in different segments of the market.

The
Company&rsquo;s private label and branded coffee sales are primarily to customers that are located throughout the United States
with limited sales in Canada and certain countries in Asia. Such customers include supermarkets
 wholesalers
 and individually-owned
and multi-unit retailers. The Company&rsquo;s unprocessed green coffee
 which includes over 90 specialty coffee offerings
 is
sold primarily to specialty gourmet roasters and to coffee shop operators in the United States with limited sales in Australia
Canada
 England and China.

The
Company&rsquo;s wholesale green
 private label
 and branded coffee product categories generate revenues and cost of sales individually
but incur selling
 general and administrative expenses in the aggregate. There are no individual product managers and discrete
financial information is not available for any of the product lines. The Company&rsquo;s product portfolio is used in one business
and it operates and competes in one business activity and economic environment. In addition
 the three product lines share customers
manufacturing resources
 sales channels
 and marketing support. Thus
 the Company considers the three product lines to be one
single reporting segment.

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

BASIS
OF PRESENTATION:

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
 Organic Products Trading Company
 LLC (&ldquo;OPTCO&rdquo;)
Sonofresco LLC (&ldquo;SONO&rdquo;)
 Comfort Foods
 Inc. (&ldquo;CFI&rdquo;) and Generations Coffee Company
 LLC (&ldquo;GCC&rdquo;).
All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

USE
OF ESTIMATES:

The
preparation of the Company&rsquo;s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures.
Significant estimates include allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable and reserves
 inventory obsolescence
 depreciation
intangible asset valuations and useful lives
 taxes
 contingencies
 and valuation of financial instruments. These estimates may
be adjusted as more current information becomes available
 and any adjustment could have a significant impact on recorded amounts.



Cash
consists primarily of unrestricted cash on deposit at financial institutions and brokerage firms.

 2017 AND 2016

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont&rsquo;d):

PREPAID
GREEN COFFEE:

Prepaid
coffee is an item that emanates from OPTCO. The balance represents advance payments made by OPTCO to several coffee growing cooperatives
for the purchase of green coffee. Interest is charged to the cooperatives for these advances. Interest earned was $19
430 and
$41
176 as of October 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively. The prepaid coffee balance was $171
350 and $435
577 as of October 31
2017 and 2016
 respectively.

ACCOUNTS
RECEIVABLE:

Trade
accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts
for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Management considers the following
factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts: customer credit-worthiness
 past transaction history
with the customer
 current economic industry trends
 and changes in customer payment terms. Past due balances over 60 days and
other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectability. If the financial condition of the Company&rsquo;s customers
were to deteriorate
 adversely affecting their ability to make payments
 additional allowances would be required. Based on management&rsquo;s
assessment
 the Company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation
allowance. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a
charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable.

The
reserve for sales discounts represents the estimated discount that customers will take upon payment. The reserve for other allowances
represents the estimated amount of returns
 slotting fees and volume based discounts estimated to be incurred by the Company from
its customers. The allowances are summarized as follows:

 first out basis) or net realizable value
 including provisions for obsolescence commensurate
with known or estimated exposures. There are no reserves for obsolescence as of October 31
 2017 and 2016.

MACHINERY
AND EQUIPMENT:

Machinery
and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Purchases of machinery and equipment and additions and betterments which substantially extend the useful life of an asset are
capitalized at cost. Expenditures which do not materially prolong the normal useful life of an asset are charged to operations
as incurred. The Company also provides for amortization of leasehold improvements.

COMMODITIES
HELD BY BROKER: 

The
commodities held at broker represent the market value of the Company&rsquo;s trading account
 which consists of option and future
contracts for coffee held with a brokerage firm. The Company uses options and futures contracts
 which are not designated or qualifying
as hedging instruments
 to partially hedge the effects of fluctuations in the price of green coffee beans. Options and futures
contracts are recognized at fair value in the consolidated financial statements with current recognition of gains and losses on
such positions. The Company&rsquo;s accounting for options and futures contracts may increase earnings volatility in any particular
period.

The
Company has open position contracts held by the broker
 which are summarized as follows:

OCTOBER

 2017 AND 2016

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont&rsquo;d):

GOODWILL
AND TRADEMARKS:

The
Company has determined that its goodwill and trademarks
 which consist of product lines
 trade names and packaging designs have
an indefinite useful life. The value of the goodwill and trademarks was allocated based on an independent valuation. Goodwill
and trademarks are not amortized but are assigned to a specific reporting unit or asset class and tested for impairment at least
annually or upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that the reporting unit&rsquo;s carrying amount of
goodwill and trademarks is greater than its fair value. As of October 31
 2017 and 2016
 the Company has determined by using a
qualitative assessment that an impairment did not exist. In 2011
 the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard ASB ASU 2011-08
Intangibles &ndash; Goodwill and Other &ndash; Testing Goodwill for Impairment
 which allows an entity to first assess qualitative
factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under this amendment
an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines
 based on a qualitative
assessment
 that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The amendment includes a number
of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment.

CUSTOMER
LIST AND RELATIONSHIPS:

Customer
list and relationships consist of a specific customer lists and customer contracts obtained by the Company in the acquisition
of OPTCO
 Comfort Foods and Sonofresco which are being amortized on the straight-line method over their estimated useful life
of twenty years.



The
Company expenses the cost of advertising and promotion as incurred. Advertising costs charged to operations totaled $243
658 and
$170
774 for the years ended October 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively.

INCOME
TAXES:

The
Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method which requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities
to be computed for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result
in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences
are expected to affect taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current or non-current
based on their characteristics. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount
expected to be realized. The income tax provision or benefit is the tax incurred for the period plus or minus the change during
the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.

EARNINGS
PER SHARE:

Basic
earnings per common share were computed by dividing net income by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
plus the dilutive effect of common shares issuable upon exercise of potential sources of dilution.

The
weighted average common shares outstanding used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share were 5
858
376 and
6
082
777 for the years ended October 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively.

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OCTOBER

 2017 AND 2016

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont&rsquo;d):

FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

The
carrying amounts of cash
 accounts receivable
 notes receivable
 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value
because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying amount of the bank line of credit borrowings approximates
fair value because the debt is based on current rates at which the Company could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities.
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time
 based on relevant market information about the financial instruments
when available. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore
cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

REVENUE
RECOGNITION:

The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance. Revenue is recognized at the point title and risk of
ownership transfers to its customers upon the Company&rsquo;s shippers taking possession of the goods at the time of shipment
because i) title passes in accordance with the terms of the Company&rsquo;s purchase orders and with its agreements with its customers
ii) any risk of loss is covered by the Company&rsquo;s customers&rsquo; insurance
 iii) there is persuasive evidence of a sales
arrangement
 iv) the sales price is determinable and v) collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Thus
 revenue
is recognized at the point of shipment to its customers.

Returns:
The Company does not accept returns for damaged goods on packaged coffee and usable green coffee
 as the customer takes possession
of our product at the point of shipment. In the event a customer claims receipt of damaged goods
 the Company
 acting as an agent
on behalf of the customer
 may file a claim for reimbursement with the shipper. The Company is not obligated or required to act
as an agent on behalf of its customers
 but may make the business decision to do so as a convenience to its customers. The shipper
keeps the damaged product. The Company will then ship a completely new order to the customer once a claim has been filed and the
Company receives reimbursement or credit from the shipper for the initial shipment. The Company does evaluate the need
 if any
of an accrual for returns for damaged goods. To date
 returns for damaged goods have been immaterial. The Company estimates that
based on historical trends
 that future returns for damaged goods should also be immaterial.

In
the event that the Company ships an incorrect order or has returns for short dated product
 the Company will accept those two
types of items back as returns. The amount for these two types of returns are estimated
 accrued and recognized at the date of
sale. These amounts are included in the determination of net sales.

Slotting
fees: Certain retailers require the payment of slotting fees in order to obtain space for the Company&rsquo;s products on the
retailer&rsquo;s store shelves. The cost of these fees are estimated
 accrued and recognized at the earlier of the date cash is
paid or a liability to the retailer is created. The amounts are included in the determination of net sales.

Sales
discounts: The amount of sales discounts are estimated
 accrued and recognized at the date of the sale. These amounts are included
in the determination of net sales.

REVENUE
RECOGNITION (cont&rsquo;d):

Volume-based
incentives: These incentives typically involve rebates or refunds of a specific amount of cash consideration that are redeemable
only if the reseller completes a specified cumulative level of sales transactions. Under incentive programs of this nature
 the
Company estimates and accrues the cost of the rebate when it is taken by the reseller. These amounts are included in the determination
of net sales.

Cooperative
advertising: Under these arrangements
 the Company will agree to reimburse the reseller for a portion of the costs incurred by
the reseller to advertise and promote certain of the Company&rsquo;s products. The Company estimates
 accrues and recognizes the
cost of cooperative advertising programs in the period in which the advertising and promotional activity first takes place. The
costs of these incentives are included in advertising expense.

SHIPPING

Revenue
earned from shipping and handling fees is reflected in net sales. Costs associated with shipping product to customers aggregating

 is included in selling and
administrative expenses.

CONCENTRATION
OF RISK:

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash deposits at financial
institutions and brokerage firms.

Accounts
at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to certain limits. At October 31
 2017
and 2016
 the Company had approximately $176
000 and $1
539
429 in excess of FDIC insured limits
 respectively.

The
accounts at the brokerage firm contain cash and securities. Balances are insured up to $500
000
 with a limit of $100
000 for
cash
 by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). At October 31
 2017 and 2016
 the Company had approximately $1
122
000
and $348
041 in excess of SIPC insured limits
 respectively.

See
Note 10 for concentration of risks with respect to trade receivables and purchases from accounts payable vendors.

OPERATING
LEASES:

The
Company has operating lease agreements for its corporate office and warehouses
 some of which contain provisions for future rent
increases or periods in which rent payments are abated. Operating leases which provide for lease payments that vary materially
from the straight-line basis are adjusted for financial accounting purposes to reflect rental income or expense on the straight-line
basis in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the FASB. The excess of straight-line rent over actual payments
by the Company of $240
379 and $231
216 is included as deferred rent payable as of October 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively.

2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont&rsquo;d):

EQUITY
METHOD OF ACCOUNTING:

Investee
companies that are not consolidated
 but over which the Company exercises significant influence
 are accounted for under the equity
method of accounting. Whether or not the Company exercises significant influence with respect to an Investee depends on an evaluation
of several factors including
 among others
 representation on the Investee company&rsquo;s board of directors and ownership level
which is generally a 20% to 50% interest in the voting securities of the Investee company. Under the equity method of accounting
an Investee company&rsquo;s accounts are not reflected within the Company&rsquo;s Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated
Statements of Income; however
 the Company&rsquo;s share of the earnings or losses of the Investee company is reflected in the
caption &ldquo;Loss from equity method investments&rdquo; in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company&rsquo;s carrying
value in an equity method Investee company is reflected in the caption &ldquo;Equity method investments&rdquo; in the Company&rsquo;s
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The
Company&rsquo;s investment in a company that is accounted for on the equity method of accounting consist of the following: (1)
20% interest in Healthwise Gourmet Coffees
 LLC
 a distributor of low acidity coffees. The investments in this company amounted
to $100
000. The loss recognized amounted to $955 and $972 for the years ended October 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively. The net
value of this investment as presented on our consolidated balance sheet at October 31
 2017 and 2016 was $94
643 and $95
598
respectively.

NOTE
3 - RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AFFECTING THE COMPANY: 

The
FASB has issued ASU No. 2015-17


how deferred taxes are classified on organizations&rsquo; balance sheets. The ASU eliminates the current requirement for organizations
to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead
 organizations
will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The amendments apply to all organizations
that present a classified balance sheet. For public companies
 the amendments are effective for financial statements issued for
annual periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 and interim periods within those annual periods. For private companies
 not-for-profit
organizations
 and employee benefit plans
 the amendments are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning
after December 15
 2017
 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15
 2018. The adoption of this standard
is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In
July 2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-11
 &ldquo;Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory
&rdquo; which applies
to inventory that is measured using first-in
 first-out (&ldquo;FIFO&rdquo;) or average cost. Under the updated guidance
 an entity
should measure inventory that is within scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value
 which is the estimated selling prices
in the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal and transportation. Subsequent measurement
is unchanged for inventory that is measured using last-in
 last-out (&ldquo;LIFO&rdquo;). This ASU is effective for annual and
interim periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 and should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted at the beginning
of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.

The
FASB issued ASU 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise
from operating leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the
lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with
a term of 12 months or less
 a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize
lease assets and lease liabilities. In transition
 lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning
of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach.

Public
business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim
periods within those fiscal years (i.e.
 January 1
 2019
 for a calendar year entity). Nonpublic business entities should apply
the amendments for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019 (i.e.
 January 1
 2020
 for a calendar year entity)
 and interim
periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2020. Early application is permitted for all public business entities
and all nonpublic business entities upon issuance. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.

3 - RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AFFECTING THE COMPANY (cont&rsquo;d):

In
May 2014 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09
 
 which is a new standard related to revenue
recognition. Under the new standard
 recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised services or goods
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In
addition
 the standard requires disclosure of the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from
customer contracts. The standard must be adopted using either a full retrospective approach for all periods presented in the period
of adoption or a modified retrospective approach. In July 2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-14

- Deferral of the Effective Date
 which defers the implementation of this new standard to be effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted effective January 1
 2017. In March 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-08

 which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new
revenue recognition standard pursuant to ASU 2014-09. In April 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-10

and Licensing
 and in May 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-12


amend certain aspects of the new revenue recognition standard pursuant to ASU 2014-09. We are currently evaluating which transition
approach we will utilize and the impact of adopting this accounting standard on our financial statements.

In
July 2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-11
 &ldquo;Earnings Per Share (Topic 260)
 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480)
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): I. Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features
 II. Replacement
of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests with a Scope Exception&rdquo; which addresses narrow issues identified as a result of the
complexity associated with applying generally accepted accounting principles for certain financial instruments with characteristics
of liabilities and equity. Part I of this Update addresses the complexity of accounting for certain financial instruments with
down round features. Current accounting guidance creates cost and complexity for entities that issue financial instruments (such
as warrants and convertible instruments) with down round features that require fair value measurement of the entire instrument
or conversion option. Part II of this Update addresses the difficulty of navigating Topic 480
 Distinguishing Liabilities from
Equity
 because of the existence of extensive pending content in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This pending content
is the result of the indefinite deferral of accounting requirements about mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of certain
nonpublic entities and certain mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests. The amendments in Part I of this Update change
the classification analysis of certain equity-linked financial instruments (or embedded features) with down round features. When
determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments
 a down round feature
no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity&rsquo;s own stock. The
amendments also clarify existing disclosure requirements for equity-classified instruments. The amendments in Part II of this
Update recharacterize the indefinite deferral of certain provisions of Topic 480 that now are presented as pending content in
the Codification
 to a scope exception. These amendments in Part I of this update are effective for annual and interim periods
beginning after December 15
 2018
 early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts
the amendments in an interim period
 any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes
that interim period. The amendments in Part I of this Update should be applied in either of the following ways: (1) Retrospectively
to outstanding financial instruments with a down round feature by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the statement of
financial position as of the beginning of the first fiscal year and interim period(s) in which the pending content that links
to this paragraph is effective. (2) Retrospectively to outstanding financial instruments with a down round feature for each prior
reporting period presented in accordance with the guidance on accounting changes in paragraphs 250-10-45-5 through 45-10. The
amendments in Part II of this Update do not require any transition guidance because those amendments do not have an accounting
effect.

On
April 25
 2017 the Company and OPTCO (together with the Company
 collectively referred to herein as the &ldquo;Borrowers&rdquo;)
entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the &ldquo;A&amp;R Loan Agreement&rdquo;) with Sterling
 which
consolidated the Company Financing Agreement and the OPTCO Financing Agreement.

Pursuant
to the A&amp;R Loan Agreement
 the terms of each of the Company Financing Agreement and the OPTCO Financing Agreement were amended
and restated to
 among other things: (i) provide for a new Maturity Date of February 28
 2018; (ii) consolidate the principal
amounts of the Company Financing Agreement and the OPTCO Financing Agreement to provide for a maximum principal amount limit of
$12
000
000 for the Borrowers
 collectively
 OPTCO is limited to a $3
000
000 maximum principal amount sublimit;
(iii) expand the borrowing base to include
 along with 85% of eligible accounts receivable
 up to the lesser of $2
000
000 as
to the Company and $1
500
000 as to OPTCO; (iv) effective March 1
 2017
 converted the interest rate on the average unpaid balance
of the A&amp;R Loan Facility from an interest rate per annum equal to the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate to an interest rate per
annum equal to the sum of the LIBOR rate plus 2.4%; (v) require the Company and OPTCO to pay
 collectively
 upon the occurrence
of certain termination events
 a prepayment premium of 1.0% (as opposed to the 0.5% under the OPTCO Financing Agreement) of the
maximum amount of the A&amp;R Loan Facility in effect as of the date of the termination event; (vi) eliminate the overadvance
fee; and (vii) establish a Letter of Credit Facility (as defined in the A&amp;R Loan Agreement) with a maximum obligation amount
of $1
000
000
 and subject to other terms and conditions described therein. The Company is currently negotiating the terms
of a new facility with Sterling and the Company expects to enter into a new facility on or before February 28
 2018 or extend
the line further until the terms of the new facility have been finalized.

Also
on April 25
 2017
 SONO and CFI (collectively referred to herein as the &ldquo;Guarantors&rdquo;)
 entered into a Guaranty
Agreement (the &ldquo;Guaranty Agreement&rdquo;) in connection with the Loan Agreement. The Guaranty Agreement was provided as
an inducement to Sterling to extend credit to Borrowers in exchange for the Guarantors&rsquo; unconditional guarantee of the payment
and performance obligations of the Borrowers under the Loan Agreement
 as further defined in the Guaranty Agreement.

Each
of the Company Loan Facility and A&amp;R Loan Agreement contains covenants
 subject to certain exceptions
 that place annual restrictions
on the Borrowers&rsquo; operations
 including covenants relating to debt restrictions
 capital expenditures
 indebtedness
 minimum
deposit restrictions
 tangible net worth
 net profit
 leverage
 employee loan restrictions
 dividend and repurchase restrictions
(common stock and preferred stock)
 and restrictions on intercompany transactions. The Loan Facility also requires that we maintain
a minimum working capital at all times
 and the A&amp;R Loan Agreement requires that the Borrowers
 on a consolidated basis
 maintain
a minimum working capital at all times and achieve a minimum net profit amount as of fiscal year end during the term of the A&amp;R
Loan Agreement. The Company and OPTCO
 as applicable were in compliance with all required financial covenants at October 31
 2017
and 2016.

Each
of the Company Loan Facility and the A&amp;R Loan Agreement is secured by all tangible and intangible assets of the Company. Other
than as amended and restated by the A&amp;R Loan Agreement
 the Company Financing Agreement and the OPTCO Financing Agreement
remains in full force and effect.

As
of October 31
 2017 and 2016
 the outstanding balance under the bank line of credit was $8
407

A
valuation allowance was not provided at October 31
 2017 or 2016. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets
 management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those
temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 projected future
taxable income
 and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections
for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are expected to be deductible
 management believes
it is more likely than not the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of the deferred tax
asset considered realizable
 however
 could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced.

As
of October 31
 2017 and 2016
 the Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits or open tax positions. The Company&rsquo;s
practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of October 31
 2017
and 2016
 the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to income taxes. The Company currently has no federal or state
tax examinations in progress.

Company files a U.S. federal income tax return and California

 and Oregon state tax returns. The Company&rsquo;s federal
income tax return is no longer subject to examination by the federal taxing authority for years before fiscal 2014. The Company&rsquo;s
California
 Colorado and New Jersey income tax returns are no longer subject to examination by their respective taxing authorities
for the years before fiscal 2011. The Company&rsquo;s Oregon

(K) RETIREMENT PLAN:

The
Company has a 401(k) Retirement Plan
 which covers all the full time employees who have completed one year of service and have

NOTE
11 - ECONOMIC DEPENDENCY:

Approximately
25% of the Company&rsquo;s sales were derived from four customers during the year ended October 31
 2017. These customers also
accounted for approximately $6
175
000 or 46% of the Company&rsquo;s accounts receivable balance at October 31
 2017. Approximately
29% of the Company&rsquo;s sales were derived from one customer during the year ended October 31
 2016. This customer also accounted
for approximately $3
661
000 or 27% of the Company&rsquo;s accounts receivable balance at October 31
 2016. Concentration of credit
risk with respect to other trade receivables is limited due to the short payment terms generally extended by the Company
 by ongoing
credit evaluations of customers
 and by maintaining an allowance for doubtful accounts and other allowances that management believes
will adequately provide for credit losses.

For
the year ended October 31
 2017
 approximately 28% of the Company&rsquo;s purchases were from five vendors. These vendors accounted
for approximately $145
000 of the Company&rsquo;s accounts payable at October 31
 2017. For the year ended October 31
 2016
 approximately
43% of the Company&rsquo;s purchases were from four vendors. These vendors accounted for approximately $609
000 of the Company&rsquo;s
accounts payable at October 31
 2016. Management does not believe the loss of any one vendor would have a material adverse effect
of the Company&rsquo;s operations due to the availability of many alternate suppliers.

NOTE
14 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS:

Fair
value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date
 not adjusted for transaction costs. The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels giving the highest priority
to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs
(Level 3) as described below:

Level
1 Inputs &ndash; Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible by the Company;

Level
2 Inputs &ndash; Quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable
either directly or indirectly;

Level
3 Inputs &ndash; Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability including significant assumptions of the Company and other market
participants.

The
Company determines fair values for its investment assets as follows:

Investments
at fair value consist of commodity securities and deferred compensation plan assets.

The
Company maintains a deferred compensation plan. The fair value of the plan assets are classified within Level 1 as the assets
are valued using quoted prices in active markets. The assets are included with Deposits and other assets in the accompanying balance
sheets. Additional information related to the Company&rsquo;s deferred compensation plan is disclosed in Note 11.

The
Company&rsquo;s commodity securities are classified within Level 2 and include coffee futures and options contracts. To determine
fair value
 the Company utilizes the market approach valuation technique for the coffee futures and options contracts. The Company
uses Level 2 inputs that are based on market data of similar instruments that are in observable markets. All commodities on the
balance sheet are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in earnings.

The
following tables present the Company&rsquo;s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are
categorized using the fair value hierarchy.

    am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
    and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for
    the registrant and have:

    
    

    
Designed
    such disclosure controls and procedures
 or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under my supervision
    to ensure that material information relating to the registrant
 including its consolidated subsidiaries
 is made known to
    me by others within those entities
 particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

    
    

    
Designed
    such internal controls over financial reporting
 or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
    my supervision
 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
    statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

    
    

    
Evaluated
    the effectiveness of the registrant&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report my conclusions
    about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures
 as of the end of the period covered by this report based
    on such evaluation; and

    
    

    
Disclosed
    in this report any change in the registrant&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant&rsquo;s
    fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect
 the registrant&rsquo;s internal
    control over financial reporting; and

    
    

5.
    
I
    have disclosed
 based on my most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting
 to the registrant&rsquo;s
    auditors and the audit committee of the registrant&rsquo;s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

    
    

    
All
    significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
    are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant&rsquo;s ability to record
 process
 summarize and report financial
    information; and

    
    

    
Any
    fraud
 whether or not material
 that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant&rsquo;s
    internal control over financial reporting.

 Inc. (the&#13;&amp;#8220;Company&amp;#8221;) conducts wholesale coffee operations
 including manufacturing
 roasting
 packaging
 marketing and distributing&#13;roasted and blended coffees for private labeled accounts and its own brands
 and it sells green coffee. The Company&amp;#8217;s core&#13;product
 coffee

 blended
 packaged and sold under the specifications and names of others

 wholesalers
 and individually-owned and multi-unit retailers.&#13;The Company&amp;#8217;s unprocessed green coffee
 which includes over 90 specialty coffee offerings
 is sold primarily to specialty&#13;gourmet roasters and to coffee shop operators in the United States with limited sales in Australia
 Canada

 private label
 and branded coffee product categories generate revenues and cost of sales individually but incur selling
&#13;general and administrative expenses in the aggregate. There are no individual product managers and discrete financial information&#13;is not available for any of the product lines. The Company&amp;#8217;s product portfolio is used in one business and it operates and&#13;competes in one business activity and economic environment. In addition
 the three product lines share customers
 manufacturing&#13;resources
 sales channels
 and marketing support. Thus


 2017
 by and among the Company
 Comfort Foods
 Inc.
 a Massachusetts corporation (&amp;#8220;CFI&amp;#8221;)
&#13;Stephen J. Beattie (the &amp;#8220;Trustee&amp;#8221;)
 as trustee of the Stephen J. Beattie Revocable Trust of 2013 (the &amp;#8220;Trust&amp;#8221;)&#13;and Victor Janovich (together
 with the Trustee on behalf of the Trust
 the &amp;#8220;Sellers&amp;#8221;)
 the Company
 acquired all of&#13;the outstanding capital stock of CFI. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and was not a significant acquisition&#13;for the Company. The purpose of the transaction was to expand the Company&amp;#8217;s presence in the northeast. The Company purchased&#13;the shares of capital stock for a purchase price of $2
300
000 in cash
 subject to the holdback of $25
000 for a six month period&#13;following the consummation of the transaction to secure the Sellers&amp;#8217; indemnification obligations. In addition
 immediately&#13;following consummation of the transaction
 the Company also paid all of the existing bank debt of CFI
 totaling approximately $605

 the employees&#13;of CFI remained employees of CFI
 with the exception of Stephen Beattie
 CFI&amp;#8217;s then Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Beattie&#13;entered into an advisory agreement (the &amp;#8220;Advisory Agreement&amp;#8221;) with CFI
 dated as of February 23
 2017
 pursuant to&#13;which Mr. Beattie agreed to provide services to CFI on an independent contractor basis
 to ensure continuity of the business and&#13;its operations in Massachusetts. The initial term of the Advisory Agreement commenced on April 1
 2017 and was set to expire on&#13;December 31
 2017
 unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Advisory Agreement. On September&#13;6
 2017
 the Company terminated the Advisory Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement
 Mr. Beattie was paid $5

 2017 or 2016. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets
 management considers whether it&#13;is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred&#13;tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become&#13;deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 projected future taxable income
 and tax planning&#13;strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income&#13;over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are expected to be deductible
 management believes it is more likely than not&#13;the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable

&amp;#160;&lt;i&gt;Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes
&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#160;which changes how deferred&#13;taxes are classified on organizations&amp;#8217; balance sheets. The ASU eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present&#13;deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead
 organizations will be required&#13;to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The amendments apply to all organizations that present a classified&#13;balance sheet. For public companies
 the amendments are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning&#13;after December 15
 2016
 and interim periods within those annual periods. For private companies
 not-for-profit organizations
&#13;and employee benefit plans
 the amendments are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December&#13;15
 2017
 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15

 the FASB issued&#13;ASU 2015-11
 &amp;#8220;Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory
&amp;#8221; which applies to inventory that is&#13;measured using first-in
 first-out (&amp;#8220;FIFO&amp;#8221;) or average cost. Under the updated guidance
 an entity should measure inventory&#13;that is within scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value
 which is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course&#13;of business
 less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged&#13;for inventory that is measured using last-in
 last-out (&amp;#8220;LIFO&amp;#8221;). This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods&#13;beginning after December 15
 2016

&#13;Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases. A&#13;lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use&#13;asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less
 a lessee&#13;is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities.&#13;In transition

 2018
 including interim periods within those&#13;fiscal years (i.e.

 for a calendar year entity). Nonpublic business entities should apply the amendments for fiscal&#13;years beginning after December 15

 January 1
 2020
 for a calendar year entity)
 and interim periods within fiscal&#13;years beginning after December 15

&amp;#160;&lt;i&gt;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&lt;/i&gt;
 which is a new standard related to revenue recognition. Under the&#13;new standard
 recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised services or goods in an amount that reflects&#13;the consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition
 the standard requires&#13;disclosure of the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. The standard&#13;must be adopted using either a full retrospective approach for all periods presented in the period of adoption or a modified retrospective&#13;approach. In July 2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-14
&amp;#160;&lt;i&gt;Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective&#13;Date&lt;/i&gt;
 which defers the implementation of this new standard to be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017.&#13;Early adoption is permitted effective January 1
 2017. In March 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-08
&amp;#160;&lt;i&gt;Principal versus Agent&#13;Considerations&lt;/i&gt;
 which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new revenue recognition&#13;standard pursuant to ASU 2014-09. In April 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-10

 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480)
 Derivatives and Hedging&#13;(Topic 815): I. Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features
 II. Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral&#13;for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling&#13;Interests with a Scope Exception&amp;#8221; which addresses narrow issues identified as a result of the complexity associated with&#13;applying generally accepted accounting principles for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity.&#13;Part I of this Update addresses the complexity of accounting for certain financial instruments with down round features. Current&#13;accounting guidance creates cost and complexity for entities that issue financial instruments (such as warrants and convertible&#13;instruments) with down round features that require fair value measurement of the entire instrument or conversion option. Part&#13;II of this Update addresses the difficulty of navigating Topic 480
 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity
 because of the existence&#13;of extensive pending content in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This pending content is the result of the indefinite&#13;deferral of accounting requirements about mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of certain nonpublic entities and certain&#13;mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests. The amendments in Part I of this Update change the classification analysis of&#13;certain equity-linked financial instruments (or embedded features) with down round features. When determining whether certain&#13;financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments
 a down round feature no longer precludes equity&#13;classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity&amp;#8217;s own stock. The amendments also clarify existing&#13;disclosure requirements for equity-classified instruments. The amendments in Part II of this Update recharacterize the indefinite&#13;deferral of certain provisions of Topic 480 that now are presented as pending content in the Codification
 to a scope exception.&#13;These amendments in Part I of this update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2018

 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature&#13;of these instruments.

Goodwill and trademarks are not amortized&#13;but are assigned to a specific reporting unit or asset class and tested for impairment at least annually or upon the occurrence&#13;of an event or when circumstances indicate that the reporting unit&amp;#8217;s carrying amount of goodwill and trademarks is greater&#13;than its fair value. As of October 31
 2017 and 2016
 the Company has determined by using a qualitative assessment that an impairment&#13;did not exist. In 2011
 the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard ASB ASU 2011-08 Intangibles &amp;#8211; Goodwill and Other&#13;&amp;#8211; Testing Goodwill for Impairment
 which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is&#13;necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under this amendment

The carrying amount of the bank line of credit borrowings approximates fair value because the debt is based&#13;on current rates at which the Company could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities. Fair value estimates are made at a&#13;specific point in time
 based on relevant market information about the financial instruments when available. These estimates are&#13;subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore

 that place annual restrictions on the Borrowers&amp;#8217;&#13;operations
 including covenants relating to debt restrictions
 capital expenditures
 indebtedness
 minimum deposit restrictions
&#13;tangible net worth
 net profit
 leverage
 employee loan restrictions
 dividend and repurchase restrictions (common stock and preferred&#13;stock)
 and restrictions on intercompany transactions. The Loan Facility also requires that we maintain a minimum working capital&#13;at all times
 and the A&amp;#38;R Loan Agreement requires that the Borrowers
 on a consolidated basis
 maintain a minimum working capital&#13;at all times and achieve a minimum net profit amount as of fiscal year end during the term of the A&amp;#38;R Loan Agreement. The Company&#13;and OPTCO
 as applicable were in compliance with all required financial covenants at October 31


 2017 and&#13;2016
 the outstanding balance under the bank line of credit was $8

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]









 Inc. (the
&#8220;Company&#8221;) conducts wholesale coffee operations
 including manufacturing
 roasting
 packaging
 marketing and distributing
roasted and blended coffees for private labeled accounts and its own brands
 and it sells green coffee. The Company&#8217;s core
product
 coffee
 can be summarized and divided into three product categories (&#8220;product lines&#8221;) as follows:

&#160;unroasted
raw beans imported from around the world and sold to large and small roasters and coffee shop operators;

&#160;coffee
roasted
 blended
 packaged and sold under the specifications and names of others
 including supermarkets that want to have their
own brand name on coffee to compete with national brands; and

&#160;coffee
roasted and blended to the Company&#8217;s own specifications and packaged and sold under the Company&#8217;s seven proprietary
and licensed brand names in different segments of the market.


label and branded coffee sales are primarily to customers that are located throughout the United States with limited sales in Canada
and certain countries in Asia. Such customers include supermarkets
 wholesalers
 and individually-owned and multi-unit retailers.
The Company&#8217;s unprocessed green coffee
 which includes over 90 specialty coffee offerings
 is sold primarily to specialty
gourmet roasters and to coffee shop operators in the United States with limited sales in Australia
 Canada
 England and China.


green
 private label
 and branded coffee product categories generate revenues and cost of sales individually but incur selling
general and administrative expenses in the aggregate. There are no individual product managers and discrete financial information
is not available for any of the product lines. The Company&#8217;s product portfolio is used in one business and it operates and
competes in one business activity and economic environment. In addition
 the three product lines share customers
 manufacturing
resources
 sales channels
 and marketing support. Thus
 the Company considers the three product lines to be one single reporting
segment.







The entire disclosure for the nature of an entity's business
 major products or services
 principal markets including location
 and the relative importance of its operations in each business and the basis for the determination
 including but not limited to
 assets
 revenues
 or earnings. For an entity that has not commenced principal operations

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES:




statements include the accounts of the Company
 Organic Products Trading Company
 LLC (&#8220;OPTCO&#8221;)
 Sonofresco LLC (&#8220;SONO&#8221;)
Comfort Foods
 Inc. (&#8220;CFI&#8221;) and Generations Coffee Company
 LLC (&#8220;GCC&#8221;). All significant inter-company
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.




financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Significant estimates include
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable and reserves
 inventory obsolescence
 depreciation
 intangible asset valuations
and useful lives
 taxes
 contingencies
 and valuation of financial instruments. These estimates may be adjusted as more current
information becomes available
 and any adjustment could have a significant impact on recorded amounts.

purchase of green coffee. Interest is charged to the cooperatives for these advances. Interest earned was $19

of October 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively. The prepaid coffee balance was $171

are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Management considers the following factors when determining
the collectability of specific customer accounts: customer credit-worthiness
 past transaction history with the customer
 current
economic industry trends
 and changes in customer payment terms. Past due balances over 60 days and other higher risk amounts are
reviewed individually for collectability. If the financial condition of the Company&#8217;s customers were to deteriorate
 adversely
affecting their ability to make payments
 additional allowances would be required. Based on management&#8217;s assessment
 the
Company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance. Balances
that remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation
allowance and a credit to accounts receivable.

that its goodwill and trademarks
 which consist of product lines
 trade names and packaging designs have an indefinite useful life.
The value of the goodwill and trademarks was allocated based on an independent valuation. Goodwill and trademarks are not amortized
but are assigned to a specific reporting unit or asset class and tested for impairment at least annually or upon the occurrence
of an event or when circumstances indicate that the reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount of goodwill and trademarks is greater
than its fair value. As of October 31
 2017 and 2016
 the Company has determined by using a qualitative assessment that an impairment
did not exist. In 2011
 the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard ASB ASU 2011-08 Intangibles &#8211; Goodwill and Other
&#8211; Testing Goodwill for Impairment
 which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is
necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under this amendment
 an entity would not be required
to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines
 based on a qualitative assessment
 that it is more
likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The amendment includes a number of events and circumstances
for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment.

differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts
in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable
income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current or non-current based on their characteristics.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The income
tax provision or benefit is the tax incurred for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and
liabilities.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS:


accounts receivable
 notes receivable
 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature
of these instruments. The carrying amount of the bank line of credit borrowings approximates fair value because the debt is based
on current rates at which the Company could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities. Fair value estimates are made at a
specific point in time
 based on relevant market information about the financial instruments when available. These estimates are
subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore
 cannot be determined with precision.
Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.




in accordance with the authoritative guidance. Revenue is recognized at the point title and risk of ownership transfers to its
customers upon the Company&#8217;s shippers taking possession of the goods at the time of shipment because i) title passes in accordance
with the terms of the Company&#8217;s purchase orders and with its agreements with its customers
 ii) any risk of loss is covered
by the Company&#8217;s customers&#8217; insurance
 iii) there is persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement
 iv) the sales price
is determinable and v) collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Thus
 revenue is recognized at the point of
shipment to its customers.

at the point of shipment. In the event a customer claims receipt of damaged goods
 the Company
 acting as an agent on behalf of
the customer
 may file a claim for reimbursement with the shipper. The Company is not obligated or required to act as an agent
on behalf of its customers
 but may make the business decision to do so as a convenience to its customers. The shipper keeps the
damaged product. The Company will then ship a completely new order to the customer once a claim has been filed and the Company
receives reimbursement or credit from the shipper for the initial shipment. The Company does evaluate the need
 if any
 of an accrual
for returns for damaged goods. To date
 returns for damaged goods have been immaterial. The Company estimates that
 based on historical
trends
 that future returns for damaged goods should also be immaterial.

of net sales.


incentives typically involve rebates or refunds of a specific amount of cash consideration that are redeemable only if the reseller

NOTE 3 - RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING
PRONOUNCEMENTS AFFECTING THE COMPANY:


2015-17


taxes are classified on organizations&#8217; balance sheets. The ASU eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present
deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead
 organizations will be required
to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The amendments apply to all organizations that present a classified
balance sheet. For public companies
 the amendments are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning
after December 15
 2016
 and interim periods within those annual periods. For private companies
 not-for-profit organizations
and employee benefit plans
 the amendments are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December
15
 2017
 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15
 2018. The adoption of this standard is not expected
to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position and results of operations.


 the FASB issued
ASU 2015-11
 &#8220;Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory
&#8221; which applies to inventory that is
measured using first-in
 first-out (&#8220;FIFO&#8221;) or average cost. Under the updated guidance
 an entity should measure inventory
that is within scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value
 which is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course
of business
 less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged
for inventory that is measured using last-in
 last-out (&#8220;LIFO&#8221;). This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods
beginning after December 15
 2016
 and should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted at the beginning of an interim
or annual reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.


Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases. A
lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use
asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less
 a lessee
is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities.
In transition
 lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented
using a modified retrospective approach.


apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those
fiscal years (i.e.
 January 1
 2019
 for a calendar year entity). Nonpublic business entities should apply the amendments for fiscal
years beginning after December 15
 2019 (i.e.
 January 1
 2020
 for a calendar year entity)
 and interim periods within fiscal
years beginning after December 15
 2020. Early application is permitted for all public business entities and all nonpublic business
entities upon issuance. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.


ASU 2014-09
&#160;
 which is a new standard related to revenue recognition. Under the
new standard
 recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised services or goods in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition
 the standard requires
disclosure of the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. The standard
must be adopted using either a full retrospective approach for all periods presented in the period of adoption or a modified retrospective
approach. In July 2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-14

Date
 which defers the implementation of this new standard to be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017.
Early adoption is permitted effective January 1
 2017. In March 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-08

Considerations
 which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new revenue recognition
standard pursuant to ASU 2014-09. In April 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-10
&#160;
and in May 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-12


certain aspects of the new revenue recognition standard pursuant to ASU 2014-09. We are currently evaluating which transition approach
we will utilize and the impact of adopting this accounting standard on our financial statements.


 the FASB issued
ASU 2017-11
 &#8220;Earnings Per Share (Topic 260)
 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480)
 Derivatives and Hedging
(Topic 815): I. Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features
 II. Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral
for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling
Interests with a Scope Exception&#8221; which addresses narrow issues identified as a result of the complexity associated with
applying generally accepted accounting principles for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity.
Part I of this Update addresses the complexity of accounting for certain financial instruments with down round features. Current
accounting guidance creates cost and complexity for entities that issue financial instruments (such as warrants and convertible
instruments) with down round features that require fair value measurement of the entire instrument or conversion option. Part
II of this Update addresses the difficulty of navigating Topic 480
 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity
 because of the existence
of extensive pending content in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This pending content is the result of the indefinite
deferral of accounting requirements about mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of certain nonpublic entities and certain
mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests. The amendments in Part I of this Update change the classification analysis of
certain equity-linked financial instruments (or embedded features) with down round features. When determining whether certain
financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments
 a down round feature no longer precludes equity
classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity&#8217;s own stock. The amendments also clarify existing
disclosure requirements for equity-classified instruments. The amendments in Part II of this Update recharacterize the indefinite
deferral of certain provisions of Topic 480 that now are presented as pending content in the Codification
 to a scope exception.
These amendments in Part I of this update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2018
 early
adoption is permitted
 including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period
any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The amendments in
Part I of this Update should be applied in either of the following ways: (1) Retrospectively to outstanding financial instruments
with a down round feature by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the statement of financial position as of the beginning
of the first fiscal year and interim period(s) in which the pending content that links to this paragraph is effective. (2) Retrospectively
to outstanding financial instruments with a down round feature for each prior reporting period presented in accordance with the
guidance on accounting changes in paragraphs 250-10-45-5 through 45-10. The amendments in Part II of this Update do not require
any transition guidance because those amendments do not have an accounting effect.

 2017 the Company
and OPTCO (together with the Company
 collectively referred to herein as the &#8220;Borrowers&#8221;) entered into an Amended and
Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the &#8220;A&#38;R Loan Agreement&#8221;) with Sterling
 which consolidated the Company Financing
Agreement and the OPTCO Financing Agreement.


Agreement
 the terms of each of the Company Financing Agreement and the OPTCO Financing Agreement were amended and restated to
among other things: (i) provide for a new Maturity Date of February 28
 2018; (ii) consolidate the principal amounts of the Company
Financing Agreement and the OPTCO Financing Agreement to provide for a maximum principal amount limit of $12
000
000 for the Borrowers
collectively
OPTCO is limited to a $3
000
000 maximum principal amount sublimit; (iii) expand the borrowing
base to include
 along with 85% of eligible accounts receivable
 up to the lesser of $2
000
000 as to the Company and $1
500
000
as to OPTCO; (iv) effective March 1
 2017
 converted the interest rate on the average unpaid balance of the A&#38;R Loan Facility
from an interest rate per annum equal to the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate to an interest rate per annum equal to the sum of the
LIBOR rate plus 2.4%; (v) require the Company and OPTCO to pay
 collectively
 upon the occurrence of certain termination events
a prepayment premium of 1.0% (as opposed to the 0.5% under the OPTCO Financing Agreement) of the maximum amount of the A&#38;R
Loan Facility in effect as of the date of the termination event; (vi) eliminate the overadvance fee; and (vii) establish a Letter
of Credit Facility (as defined in the A&#38;R Loan Agreement) with a maximum obligation amount of $1
000
000
 and subject to other
terms and conditions described therein.&#160;The Company is currently negotiating the terms of a new facility with Sterling and
the Company expects to enter into a new facility on or before February 28
 2018 or extend the line further until the terms of the
new facility have been finalized.

 entered into a Guaranty Agreement (the &#8220;Guaranty
Agreement&#8221;) in connection with the Loan Agreement. The Guaranty Agreement was provided as an inducement to Sterling to extend
credit to Borrowers in exchange for the Guarantors&#8217; unconditional guarantee of the payment and performance obligations of
the Borrowers under the Loan Agreement
 as further defined in the Guaranty Agreement.


and A&#38;R Loan Agreement contains covenants
 subject to certain exceptions
 that place annual restrictions on the Borrowers&#8217;
operations
 including covenants relating to debt restrictions
 capital expenditures
 indebtedness
 minimum deposit restrictions
tangible net worth
 net profit
 leverage

 dividend and repurchase restrictions (common stock and preferred
stock)

 and the A&#38;R Loan Agreement requires that the Borrowers
 on a consolidated basis
 maintain a minimum working capital
at all times and achieve a minimum net profit amount as of fiscal year end during the term of the A&#38;R Loan Agreement. The Company
and OPTCO
 as applicable were in compliance with all required financial covenants at October 31
 2017 and 2016.


and the A&#38;R Loan Agreement is secured by all tangible and intangible assets of the Company. Other than as amended and restated

not provided at October 31
 2017 or 2016. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets
 management considers whether it
is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred
tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become
deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 projected future taxable income
 and tax planning
strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income
over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are expected to be deductible
 management believes it is more likely than not
the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable
however
 could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced.


 2017 and
2016
 the Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits or open tax positions. The Company&#8217;s practice is to recognize
interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of October 31
 2017 and 2016
 the Company had
no accrued interest or penalties related to income taxes. The Company currently has no federal or state tax examinations in progress.

sales were derived from four customers during the year ended October 31
 2017. These customers also accounted for approximately
$6
175
000 or 46% of the Company&#8217;s accounts receivable balance at October 31
 2017. Approximately 29% of the Company&#8217;s
sales were derived from one customer during the year ended October 31
 2016. This customer also accounted for approximately $3
661
000
or 27% of the Company&#8217;s accounts receivable balance at October 31
 2016. Concentration of credit risk with respect to other
trade receivables is limited due to the short payment terms generally extended by the Company
 by ongoing credit evaluations of
customers
 and by maintaining an allowance for doubtful accounts and other allowances that management believes will adequately
provide for credit losses.


31
 2017
 approximately 28% of the Company&#8217;s purchases were from five vendors. These vendors accounted for approximately
$145
000 of the Company&#8217;s accounts payable at October 31
 2017. For the year ended October 31
 2016
 approximately 43% of
the Company&#8217;s purchases were from four vendors. These vendors accounted for approximately $609
000 of the Company&#8217;s
accounts payable at October 31
 2016. Management does not believe the loss of any one vendor would have a material adverse effect
of the Company&#8217;s operations due to the availability of many alternate suppliers.







The entire disclosure for any concentrations existing at the date of the financial statements that make an entity vulnerable to a reasonably possible
 near-term
 severe impact. This disclosure informs financial statement users about the general nature of the risk associated with the concentration
 and may indicate the percentage of concentration risk as of the balance sheet date.

inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels giving the highest priority to quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3) as described
below:


quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible by the Company;


prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable
 either directly
or indirectly;


inputs for the asset or liability including significant assumptions of the Company and other market participants.

related to the Company&#8217;s deferred compensation plan is disclosed in Note 11.


securities are classified within Level 2 and include coffee futures and options contracts. To determine fair value
 the Company

at the amount the Company expects to collect. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting
from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Management considers the following factors when determining the
collectability of specific customer accounts: customer credit-worthiness
 past transaction history with the customer
 current economic
industry trends
 and changes in customer payment terms. Past due balances over 60 days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed
individually for collectability. If the financial condition of the Company&#8217;s customers were to deteriorate
 adversely affecting
their ability to make payments
 additional allowances would be required. Based on management&#8217;s assessment
 the Company provides
for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance. Balances that remain outstanding
after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit
to accounts receivable.

its goodwill and trademarks
 which consist of product lines
 trade names and packaging designs have an indefinite useful life.
The value of the goodwill and trademarks was allocated based on an independent valuation. Goodwill and trademarks are not amortized
but are assigned to a specific reporting unit or asset class and tested for impairment at least annually or upon the occurrence
of an event or when circumstances indicate that the reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount of goodwill and trademarks is greater
than its fair value. As of October 31
 2017 and 2016
 the Company has determined by using a qualitative assessment that an impairment
did not exist. In 2011
 the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard ASB ASU 2011-08 Intangibles &#8211; Goodwill and Other
&#8211; Testing Goodwill for Impairment
 which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is
necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under this amendment
 an entity would not be required
to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines
 based on a qualitative assessment
 that it is more
likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The amendment includes a number of events and circumstances
for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment.

temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible
amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect
taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current or non-current based on their characteristics.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The income
tax provision or benefit is the tax incurred for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets
and liabilities.

 notes receivable
 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of
these instruments. The carrying amount of the bank line of credit borrowings approximates fair value because the debt is based
on current rates at which the Company could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities. Fair value estimates are made at a
specific point in time
 based on relevant market information about the financial instruments when available. These estimates are
subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore
 cannot be determined with precision.
Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.








accordance with the authoritative guidance. Revenue is recognized at the point title and risk of ownership transfers to its customers
upon the Company&#8217;s shippers taking possession of the goods at the time of shipment because i) title passes in accordance
with the terms of the Company&#8217;s purchase orders and with its agreements with its customers
 ii) any risk of loss is covered
by the Company&#8217;s customers&#8217; insurance
 iii) there is persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement
 iv) the sales price
is determinable and v) collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Thus
 revenue is recognized at the point of
shipment to its customers.

 as the customer takes possession of our product at the point
of shipment. In the event a customer claims receipt of damaged goods
 the Company
 acting as an agent on behalf of the customer
may file a claim for reimbursement with the shipper. The Company is not obligated or required to act as an agent on behalf of its
customers
 but may make the business decision to do so as a convenience to its customers. The shipper keeps the damaged product.
The Company will then ship a completely new order to the customer once a claim has been filed and the Company receives reimbursement
or credit from the shipper for the initial shipment. The Company does evaluate the need
 if any
 of an accrual for returns for
damaged goods. To date
 returns for damaged goods have been immaterial. The Company estimates that
 based on historical trends
that future returns for damaged goods should also be immaterial.

Investment in short-term money-market instruments (such as commercial paper
 banker's acceptances
 repurchase agreements
 government securities
 certificates of deposit
 and so forth) which are highly liquid (that is
 readily convertible to known amounts of cash) and so near their maturity that they present an insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally
 only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify as cash equivalents by definition. Original maturity means an original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example
 both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However
 a Treasury note purchased three-years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months.
