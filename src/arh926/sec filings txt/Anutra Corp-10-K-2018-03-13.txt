                               PART I
Item 1.  Business
     Anutra Corporation (formerly Still Sound Acquisition Corporation)
(Anutra or the Company) was incorporated on December 7
 2016 under
the laws of the State of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate
undertaking
 including
 but not limited to
 selected mergers and
acquisitions. In February
 2018 the Company changed its name to Anutra
Corporation in anticipation of a subsequent change in control.
      The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception.
The Company was formed to provide a method for a foreign or domestic
private company to become a reporting company with a class of
securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
     The Company registered its common stock on a Form 10
registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Rule 12(g) thereof.  The
Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission periodic
and current reports under Rule 13(a) of the Exchange Act
 including
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports Form 10-K.
     As of December 31
 2017
 the Company had not generated revenues
and had no income or cash flows from operations since inception.  At
December 31
 2017
 the Company had sustained net loss of $1
539
and an accumulated deficit of $4
851.
     The Company's independent auditors have issued a report raising
substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern.  At present
 the Company has no operations and the
continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon
financial support from its stockholders
 its ability to obtain
necessary equity financing to continue operations and/or to
successfully locate and negotiate with a business entity for the
combination of that target company with the Company.
      There is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable.
     The Company has no employees.
   The president of the Company is the sole officer and director of
Tiber Creek Corporation.  Tiber Creek Corporation assists companies in
becoming public companies and assists companies with introductions to
the financial community.  Such services may include
 when and if
appropriate
 the use of an existing reporting company such as the
Company.
      In August
 2017
 Tiber Creek Corporation entered into a contract
with Anutra LLC
 a private company
 to assist it to become a public
trading company and to assist it with introductions to the financial
community.  Pursuant to such contract
 the Company
 a public reporting
company
 will effect a change in control and a subsequent business
combination with Anutra LLC.
    A business combination will normally take the form of a merger
stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange. In most
instances the private company will wish to structure the business
combination to be within the definition of a tax-free reorganization
under Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
as amended.
     Once a change in control has been effected
 new management
may issue shares of its stock prior to filing a registration statement
for the registration of its shares pursuant to the Securities Act of
1933 and such shares will be governed by the rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the sale of
unregistered securities.
Subsequent Event
      Pursuant to the contract with Tiber Creek Corporation
 Anutra
LLC anticipates effecting a change in control with the Company and
subsequently effecting a business combination of Anutra LLC with the
Company.
      In expectation of such change in control
 on February 22
 2018
the Company changed its name to Anutra Corporation.  The change in
control transaction has not yet been effected but is anticipated to
be completed shortly and the Company will file a Form 8-K noticing the
transaction.
    It is anticipated that as part of the change in control
 the
Company will:
	Cancel an aggregate of 19
500
000 shares of the 20
000
000
shares of outstanding stock valued at par.
       The current officers and directors of the Company
 James
Cassidy and James McKillop
 will resign from the offices held by
them.
      New officers and directors will be appointed and elected.
      The Company anticipates that the new officers and directors
may issue shares of common stock upon effectiveness of the change
in control.
Item 2.  Properties
     The Company has no properties and at this time has no
agreements to acquire any properties.  The Company currently uses
the offices of Management at no cost to the Company.
Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
     There is no litigation pending or threatened by or against the
Company.
    Management is aware that certain current and prior blank check
companies of which Messrs. Cassidy and McKillop were the former
officers and directors have received subpoenas for documents in regard
to an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission requesting
documentation regarding the transactions and filings for the past
five years and former share ownership of certain blank check companies.
     Management of the Company has also received subpoenas from the
Securities and Exchange Commission in regard to certain of the
transactions and filings for the past five years of certain of its
blank check companies. Management has no independent knowledge or
information as to the intent or purpose of such subpoenas but believes
the SEC is investigating whether the change in control transaction is
considered a sale of a security and if so whether a broker needs to be
used to effect the transaction.
Item 4.  Mine Safety Disclosures.
      Not applicable.
                              PART II
Item 5.  Market for Registrant's Common Equity
 Related Stockholder
	 Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
      There is currently no public market for the Company's securities.
     Following a business combination
 a target company will normally
wish to cause the Company's common stock to trade in one or more United
States securities markets.  The target company may elect to take the
steps required for such admission to quotation following the business
combination or at some later time.
     At such time as it qualifies
 the Company may choose to apply for
quotation of its securities on the OTC Bulletin Board.
     The OTC Bulletin Board is a dealer-driven quotation service.
Unlike the Nasdaq Stock Market
 companies cannot directly apply to be
quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board
 only market makers can initiate
quotes
 and quoted companies do not have to meet any quantitative
financial requirements.  Any equity security of a reporting company
not listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market or on a national securities
exchange is eligible.
     As such time as it qualifies
 the Company may choose to apply
for quotation of its securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
     In general there is greatest liquidity for traded securities on
the Nasdaq Capital Market and less on the OTC Bulletin Board.  It is
not possible to predict where
 if at all
 the securities of the Company
will be traded following a business combination.
     Since inception
 the Company has sold securities which
were not registered as follows:

Item 6.  Selected Financial Data.
	There is no selected financial data required to be filed for
a smaller reporting company.
Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
	 and Results of Operations
   The Company has no operations nor does it currently engage in any
business activities generating revenues.  The Company's principal
business objective is to achieve a business combination with a target
company.
     A combination will normally take the form of a merger
 stock-for-
stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange.  In most instances the
target company will wish to structure the business combination to be
within the definition of  a tax-free reorganization under Section 351
or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended.
     Tiber Creek Corporation has entered into a contract with Anutra
LLC to assist it in becoming a public company and with introductions
and relations with the brokerage and financial community.  As part of
that contract the Company will effect a change in control.
     The president of the Company is the president
 director and sole
shareholder of Tiber Creek Corporation.
     It is anticipated that as part of the change in control
 the
Company will:
	Cancel an aggregate of 19
500
000 shares of the 20
000
000
shares of outstanding stock valued at par.
       The current officers and directors of the Company
 James
Cassidy and James McKillop
 will resign from the offices held by
them.
      New officers and directors will be appointed and elected.
      The Company anticipates that the new officers and directors
may issue shares of common stock upon effectiveness of the change
in control.
      Anutra LLC develops
 markets and sells the Anutra brand of
products of healthy whole foods.  The Anutra line consists of over
22 food products representing years of research on Anutra Chia
intended to create healthy whole foods.  With such change in control
and anticipated subsequent business combination with Anutra LLC
 the
Company will be a sales and marketing company of the Anutra products
utilizing radio
 television
 print and social media to reach retail
food service sports nutrition and other markets.
     As of December 31
 2017
 the Company had not generated revenues
and had no income or cash flows from operations since inception.  At
December 31
 2017
 the Company had sustained net loss of $1
539.
    The Company's independent auditors have issued a report raising
substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern.  At present
 the Company has no operations and the continuation
of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon financial support
from its stockholders
 its ability to obtain necessary equity financing
to continue operations and/or to successfully locate and negotiate with
a business entity for the combination of that target company with
the Company.
2017 Year-End Analysis
      The Company has received no income
 has had no operations
nor expenses
 other than Delaware state fees and accounting fees
as required for incorporation and for the preparation of the
Company's financial statements.
Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
     The financial statements for the year ended December 31
 2017
are attached hereto.
Item 9.   Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on
          Accounting and Financial Disclosure
     There were no changes in or disagreements with accountants on
accounting and financial disclosure for the period covered by this
report.
Item 9A.   Controls and Procedures
  Pursuant to Rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant
to Exchange Act Rules.  This evaluation  was done as of the end of the
fiscal year under the supervision and with the participation of the
Company's principal executive officer (who is also the principal
financial officer).
   Management is responsible for maintaining a system of internal
control over financial reporting (ICFR) that provides reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of such reporting and the
accuracy and reliability of the preparation of financial statements
of such. Management is responsible to maintain records accurately and
fairly to reflect transactions and transactions are recorded as
necessary.  The controls should provide reasonable assurance regarding
the prevention of unauthorized
acquisition or use of assets.
     In the present case of the Company
 management consists solely
of the president and vice president and has no employees or other
personnel. As such
 management maintains sole control of all financial
transactions and all assets.  Since the president of the Company is in
sole control of the financial transactions and assets management
believes that its control reasonably and adequately addresses the
risk of a misstatement in the financial reporting.  Based upon that
evaluation
 the principal officer believes that the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in gathering
analyzing and disclosing information needed to ensure that the
information required to be disclosed by the Company in its periodic
reports is recorded
 summarized and processed timely.  The principal
executive officer is directly involved in the day-to-day operations
of the Company.
Management's Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
     The Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
the Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's
officer
 its president
 conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31
 2017. In assessing its control and procedure over financial
reporting
 management used the integrated framework created by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).  As outlined by COSO
 suitable control criteria can be
grouped into a five-component structure consisting of control
environment
 risk assessment
 control activities
 monitoring
 and
information and communication. Whether a system of internal control
is effective is a subjective judgment resulting from an assessment
of those five components
 that is
 such components are present and
functioning effectively.  Management consists solely of the president
and vice president and has no employees or other personnel and
management maintains sole control of all financial transactions and
all assets.  Using the five-component guidelines in performing its
assessment
 management believes that its ICFR is effective as of
December 31
 2017
 based on those criteria. A control system can
provide only reasonably
 not absolute
 assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met and no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues have been detected.
    KCCW Accountancy Corp.
 the independent registered public
accounting firm of the Company
 has not issued an attestation report
on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
      There have been no changes in the Company's internal controls
over financial reporting  during its fourth fiscal quarter that have
materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
its internal control over financial reporting.
Item 9B.  Other information
      Not applicable.

Management of The Company
    The Company has no full time employees.  James Cassidy and
James McKillop are the officers and directors of the Company and
its shareholders.  Mr. Cassidy
 as president of the Company
 and
Mr. McKillop as vice president
 will allocate a limited portion of
time to the activities of the Company without compensation.
Potential conflicts may arise with respect to the limited time
commitment by management and the potential demands of the
activities of the Company.
     There are no agreements or understandings for the officer or
director to resign at the request of another person and the above-
named officer and director is not acting on behalf of nor will act
at the direction of any other person.
     Set forth below are the names of the directors and officers of
the Company
 all positions and offices with the Company held
 the
period during which they have served as such
 and the business
experience during at least the last five years:
    James Cassidy
 Esq.
 LL.B.
 LL.M.
 serves as a director
president and secretary of the Company.  Mr. Cassidy received a
Bachelor of Science in Languages and Linguistics from Georgetown
University in 1960
 a Bachelor of Laws from The Catholic University
School of Law in 1963
 and a Master of Laws in Taxation from The
Georgetown University School of Law in 1968.  From 1963-1964
 Mr.
Cassidy was law clerk to the Honorable Inzer B. Wyatt of the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  From
1964-1965
 Mr. Cassidy was law clerk to the Honorable Wilbur K.
Miller of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia.  From 1969-1975
 Mr. Cassidy was an associate of the law
firm of Kieffer & Moroney and a principal in the law firm of Kieffer
& Cassidy
 Washington
 D.C. From 1975 to date
 Mr. Cassidy has been a
principal in the law firm of Cassidy & Associates
 and its predecessors
specializing in securities law and related corporate and federal
taxation matters.  Mr. Cassidy is a member of the bars of the District
of Columbia and the State of New York
 and is admitted to practice
before the United States Tax Court and the United States Supreme Court.
The Company believes Mr. Cassidy to have the business experience
necessary to serve as a director of the Company as it seeks to enter
into a business combination.  As a lawyer involved in business
transactions and securities matters
 Mr. Cassidy has  had ample
experience in evaluating companies and management
 understanding
business plans
  assisting in capital raising  and determining
corporate structure and objectives.
    James McKillop serves as a director and vice president of
the Company. Mr. McKillop began his career at Merrill Lynch. Mr.
McKillop has also been involved in financial reporting and did a
daily stock market update for KPCC radio in Pasadena
 California.
Mr. McKillop is the founder of MB Americus LLC which specializes
in consulting and public relations. Mr. McKillop has provided
consulting services to Tiber Creek Corporation for more than five
years.  Mr. McKillop has written articles for various publications
on financial matters. He has been a past member of the World Affairs
Council. Mr. McKillop received his Bachelor of Arts in Economics
in 1984 from the University of California at Los Angeles.  With his
background in financial and securities matters
 the Company believes
Mr. McKillop to have experience and knowledge that will serve
the Company in seeking
 evaluating and determining a suitable
target company.
Recent Blank Check Companies
     James Cassidy
 the former president and a director of the Company
and James McKillop
 former vice president and a director of the Company
are involved with other existing blank check companies
 and in creating
additional similar companies.  The initial business purpose of each
of these companies was or is to engage in a business combination with
an unidentified company or companies and each were or will be classified
as a blank check company until completion of a business combination.
Conflicts of Interest
     There are no binding guidelines or procedures for resolving
potential conflicts of interest. Failure by management to resolve
conflicts of interest in favor of the Company could result in
liability of management to the Company.  However
 any attempt by
shareholders to enforce a liability of management to the Company
would most likely be prohibitively expensive and time consuming.
     Code of Ethics.  The Company has not at this time adopted a
Code of Ethics pursuant to rules described in Regulation S-K.  The
Company has two persons who are the only shareholders and who serve as
the directors and officers. The Company has no operations or business and
does not receive any revenues or investment capital.  The adoption of an
Ethical Code at this time would not serve the primary purpose of such a
code to provide a manner of conduct as the development
 execution and
enforcement of such a code would be by the same persons and only
persons to whom such code applied.  Furthermore
 because the Company
does not have any activities
 there are activities or transactions
which would be subject to this code.  At the time the Company enters
into a business combination or other corporate transaction
 the current
officers and directors will recommend to any new management that such a
code be adopted.  The Company does not maintain an Internet website on
which to post a code of ethics.
     Corporate Governance.  For reasons similar to those described
above
 the Company does not have a nominating nor audit committee of the
board of directors.  At this time
 the Company consists of two shareholders
who serve as the corporate directors and officers. The Company has no
activities
 and receives no revenues.  At such time that the Company enters
into a business combination and/or has additional shareholders and a larger
board of directors and commences activities
 the Company will propose
creating committees of its board of directors
 including both a nominating
and an audit committee.  Because there are only two shareholders of the
Company
 there is no established process by which shareholders to the
Company can nominate members to the Company's board of directors.
Similarly
 however
 at such time as the Company has more shareholders and
an expanded board of directors
 the new management of the Company may
review and implement
 as necessary
 procedures for shareholder nomination
of members to the Company's board of directors.
Item 11.  Executive Compensation
     The Company's officers and directors do not receive any
compensation for services rendered to the Company
 nor have they
received such compensation in the past.  The officers and directors
are not accruing any compensation pursuant to any agreement with the
Company.
     No retirement
 pension
 profit sharing
 stock option or
insurance programs or other similar programs have been adopted by
the Company for the benefit of its employees.
     The Company does not have a compensation committee for
the same reasons as described above.
Item 12.  Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and
          Management and Related Stockholder Matters
     The following table sets forth
 as of December 31
 2017
 each
person known by the Company to be the beneficial owner of five
percent or more of the Company's common stock and the director and
officer of the Company.  The Company does not have any compensation
plans and has not authorized any securities for future issuance.
Except as noted
 the holder thereof has sole voting and investment
power with respect to the shares shown.

Item 13.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and
	  Director Independence
   As of December 31
 2017
 the Company has issued a total of
20
000
000 shares of common stock pursuant to Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act for services performed for the Company with a valuation
of an aggregate of $2
000.
    As the organizers and developers of the Company
 James M. Cassidy
and James McKillop may be considered promoters.  Mr. Cassidy has
provided services to the Company without charge consisting of preparing
and filing the charter corporate documents and preparing this
registration statement.
   The Company is not currently required to maintain an independent
director as defined by Rule 4200 of the Nasdaq Capital Market nor
does it anticipate that it will be applying for listing of its
securities on an exchange in which an independent directorship is
required. It is likely that neither Mr. Cassidy nor Mr. McKillop
would be considered independent directors if it were to do so.
Item 14.  Principal Accounting Fees and Services.
	The Company has no activities
 no income and no expenses
except for independent audit and Delaware state fees.  The Company's
president has donated his time in preparation and filing of all
state and federal required taxes and reports.
Audit Fees
        The aggregate fees incurred in 2017 for professional services
rendered by the independent registered public accounting firm for
the audits of the Company's annual financial statements and review
of financial statements included in the Company's Form 10-K and Form
10-Q reports and services normally provided in connection with
statutory and regulatory filings or engagements were as follows:
                         December 31
 2017
	                 -----------------
     Audit-Related Fees          $ 1
000
	The Company does not currently have an audit committee serving
and as a result its board of directors performs the duties of an audit
committee.  The board of directors will evaluate and approve in advance
the scope and cost of the engagement of an auditor before the auditor
renders audit and non-audit services.  The Company does not rely on pre-
approval policies and procedures.

KCCW Accountancy Corp.                        CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Anutra Corporation
   (formerly Still Sound Acquisition Corporation)
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Anutra Corporation
(formerly Still Sound Acquisition Corporation) (the Company) as of
December 31
 2017 and 2016
 and the related statements of
operations
 changes in stockholders' equity
 and cash flows
for the year ended December 31
 2017 and for the period from
December 7
 2016 (Inception) to December 31
 2016
 and the related
notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our
opinion
 the financial statements present fairly
 in all material
respects
 the financial position of the Company as of December 31
2017 and 2016
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for the year ended December 31
 2017 and for the period from December
7
 2016 (Inception) to December 31
 2016
 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.
Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2
to the financial statements
 the Company has had no revenues and income
since inception. These conditions
 among others
 raise substantial
doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
Management's plans concerning these matters are also described in
Note 2
 which includes the raising of additional equity financing or
merger with another entity. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting
firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect
to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws
and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement
 whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of
its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of
material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to
error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits
also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
/s/ KCCW Accountancy Corp.
We have served as the Company's auditor since 2017.

                (FORMERLY STILL SOUND ACQUISITION CORPORATION)
                    Notes to Financial Statements
NOTE 1   NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
NATURE OF OPERATIONS
Anutra Corporation (formerly Still Sound Acquisition Corporation)
(Anutra or the Company) was incorporated on December 7
 2016 under
the laws of the state of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking
including
 but not limited to
 selected mergers and acquisitions. The Company
changed its name in February
 2018 in anticipation of the subsequent change in
control.  The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception
and its operations to date have been limited to issuing shares to its original
shareholders. The Company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business
entity for the combination of that target company with the Company. The
combination will normally take the form of a merger
 stock-for-stock exchange
or stock-for-assets exchange. In most instances the target company will wish
to structure the business combination to be within the definition of a tax-free
reorganization under Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986
 as amended. No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful
in locating or negotiating with any target company. The Company has been
formed to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to
become a reporting company with a class of securities registered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed
to assist in understanding the Company's financial statements. Such financial
statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the Company's
management
 who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These
accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America (GAAP) in all material respects
 and have
been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying financial statements.
The Company has not earned any revenue from operations since inception.
Accordingly
 the Company's activities have been accounted for as those of
a Development Stage Enterprise as set forth in ASC 915
 Development
Stage Entities. Among the disclosures required by ASC 915
 are that the
Company's financial statements be identified as those of a development stage
company
 and that the statements of operations
 stockholders' equity and cash
flows disclose activity since the date of the Company's inception.  The Company
chose December 31 as its fiscal year end.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results could
differ from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking
institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments with original
maturities of 90 days or less. The Company did not have cash equivalents as
of December 31
 2017 and 2016
 respectively.
CONCENTRATION OF RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places its cash with
high quality banking institutions. The Company did not have cash balances
in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit as of December 31
2017 and 2016
 respectively.

                    Notes to Financial Statements
INCOME TAXES
Under ASC 740
 Income Taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when it is
more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized.  As of December 31
 2017 and 2016
 there were no deferred taxes due
to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward
prior to expiration.
LOSS PER COMMON SHARE
Basic loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing
net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted loss per common share reflect the potential
dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common
stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the
issuance of common stock that then shared in the loss of the entity.  As
of December 31
 2017 and 2016
 there are no outstanding dilutive securities.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of
financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements
of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
financial statements on a recurring basis. Additionally
 the Company adopted
guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are
recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a
nonrecurring basis. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that
prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the
lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs
(Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as
follows:
  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the
measurement date.
  Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1
that are observable for the asset or liability
 either directly or indirectly.
  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their fair
values because of the short maturity of these instruments.
NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN
The Company has not yet generated any revenue since inception to date and
has sustained operating losses of $1
539 amd $3
312 during the year ended
December 31
 2017 and the period from December 7
 2016 (Inception) to
December 31
 2016
 respectively. The Company had a working capital deficit
of $1
000 and an accumulated deficit of $4
851 as of December 31
 2017 and a
working capital deficit of $1
000 and an accumulated deficit of $3
312 as of
December 31
 2016.  The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent
on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its
obligations and/or obtaining additional financing from its shareholders or
other sources
 as may be required.

                    Notes to Financial Statements
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern; however
 the above condition
raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to do so. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future
effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and
classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern.
In order to maintain its current level of operations
 the Company will require
additional working capital from either cash flow from operations or from
the sale of its equity.  However
 the Company currently has no commitments
from any third parties for the purchase of its equity. If the Company is
unable to acquire additional working capital
 it will be required to
significantly reduce its current level of operations.
NOTE 3 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In January 2017
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01
 Business Combinations
(Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. The amendments
in this ASU clarify the definition of a business with the objective of
adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions
should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or
businesses. Basically these amendments provide a screen to determine
when a set is not a business. If the screen is not met
 the amendments
in this ASU first
 require that to be considered a business
 a set
must include
 at a minimum
 an input and a substantive process that
together significantly contribute to the ability to create output and
second
 remove the evaluation of whether a market participant could
replace missing elements. These amendments take effect for public
businesses for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017 and
interim periods within those periods
 and all other entities should
apply these amendments for fiscal years beginning after December 15
2018
 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after
December 15
 2019. The Company does not expect that the adoption of
this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated
financial statements.
In May 2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-09
 Scope of Modification
Accounting
 which amends the scope of modification accounting for
share-based payment arrangements
 provides guidance on the types of
changes to the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards to
which an entity would be required to apply modification accounting
under ASC 718. For all entities
 the ASU is effective for annual
reporting periods
 including interim periods within those annual
reporting periods
 beginning after December 15
 2017. Early adoption
is permitted
 including adoption in any interim period. The  Company
does not expect that adoption of this guidance will have a material
impact on its consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures.
In November 2016
 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-18
Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (ASU 2016-18).
The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice by adding or
clarifying guidance on classification and presentation of changes in
restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective
for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017. Early
adoption is permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied
retrospectively to all periods presented. Managementbelieves that this
ASU will only impact the Company if it has restricted cash in the future.
In August 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-15
 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic
230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (ASU 2016-
15). ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and
cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.
ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017.
The new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it
is impracticable to apply
 in which case it would be required to apply the
amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. Management
believes that the impact of this ASU to the Company's financial statements
would be insignificant.
Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its
Emerging Issues Task Force) and the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material
impact on the Company's present or future financial statements.
NOTE 4     ACCRUED LIABILITIES
As of December 31
 2017 and 2016
 the Company had accrued professional
fees of $1
000 and $1
000
 respectively.
NOTE 5   STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT
On December 7
 2016
 the Company issued 20
000
000 founders common stock
to two directors and officers pro rata as founder shares for services
rendered to the Company
 valued at $0.0001 par value per share
 for a
total of $2
000.  The Company is authorized to issue 100
000
000
shares of common stock and 20
000
000 shares of preferred stock.
As of December 31
 2017
 20
000
000 shares of common stock and no
preferred stock were issued and outstanding.
NOTE 6 SUBSEQUENT EVENT
Management has evaluated subsequent events through March 7
 2018
the date which the financial statements were available to be issued.
Except for the events disclosed above
 all subsequent events
requiring recognition as of December 31 2017 have been incorporated
into these financial statements in accordance with FASB ASC Topic
855
