Pacific Ventures Group
 Inc. (&#147;Pacific Ventures&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 3
 1986. &nbsp;Pacific Ventures operated as an insurance holding company that
 through its subsidiaries
 marketed and underwrote specialized property and casualty coverage in the general aviation insurance marketplace. &nbsp;Historically
 the Company's business has been organized into three divisions. &nbsp;In 1997
 after selling several of its divisions
 the Company&#146;s remaining insurance operations were placed into receivership and the Company ceased operating its insurance business. &nbsp;Since the Company terminated its business operations
Since the termination of its prior business
 the Company has had no operations other than seeking an acquisition or merger to bring an operating entity into the Company. &nbsp;The Company does not propose to restrict its search for a business opportunity to any particular industry or geographical area and may
 therefore
 engage in essentially any business in any industry. &nbsp;The Company has unrestricted discretion in seeking and participating in a business opportunity
 subject to the availability of such opportunities
 economic conditions
The selection of a business opportunity in which to participate is complex and risky. &nbsp;Additionally
Currently
 the Company is in the process of investigating potential business ventures which
 in the opinion of management
 will provide a source of eventual profit to the Company. &nbsp;Such involvement may take many forms
 including the acquisition of an existing business or the acquisition of assets to establish subsidiary businesses. &nbsp;At this time
investigating whether there are merger and acquisition activities in certain targeted industries. &nbsp;To this end
The Company is not currently conducting any business
 nor has it conducted any business for several years. &nbsp;Therefore
 it does not possess products or services
 distribution methods
 competitive business positions
 or major customers. &nbsp;The Company does not possess any unexpired patents or trademarks and any and all of its licensing and royalty agreements from the insurance it sought to market in the past have since expired
The activities of the Company are subject to several significant risks which arise primarily as a result of the fact that the Company has no specific business and may acquire or participate in a business opportunity based on the decision of management which potentially could act without the consent
 vote
The Company owns no properties and utilizes space on a rent-free basis from Brett Bertolami
 the Company&#146;s officer and director. &nbsp;This arrangement is expected to continue until such time as the Company becomes involved in a business venture which necessitates its relocation
 as to which no assurances can be given. &nbsp;The Company has no agreements with respect to the maintenance or future acquisition of the office facilities
 however
 if a successful merger/acquisition is negotiated
The Company is not actively engaged in conducting any business. &nbsp;Rather
 the Company is in the process of investigating potential business ventures which
 in the opinion of management
 will provide a source of eventual profit to the Company. &nbsp;Therefore
 the Company does not presently intend to invest in real estate or real estate securities
 nor have we formulated any investment policies regarding investments in real estate
 real estate mortgages
ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT&#146;S COMMON EQUITY
The Company's Common Stock is quoted on the OTCQB
The Company&#146;s Common Stock has very limited volume so the prices reflected above may not be indicative of actual prices if volume were to increase. &nbsp;At March 18
 2014
 the bid and asked price for the Company's Common Stock was $0.56 and $0.85. &nbsp;All prices listed herein reflect inter-dealer prices
 without retail mark-up
 mark-down or commissions and may not represent actual transactions with retail customers. &nbsp;Since its inception
 the Company has not paid any dividends on its Common Stock
 and the Company does not anticipate that it will pay dividends in the foreseeable future. &nbsp;At March 18
 2014
 the Company had approximately 230 stockholders of record. &nbsp;As of March 18
 2014
 the Company had 384
The Company had no revenues in 2013 or 2012. &nbsp;We had a net loss of $17
501 for the year ended December&nbsp;31
 2013. &nbsp;At December 31
 2013
 we had cash and cash equivalents of $7 and a working capital of $(6

The Company is in the process of investigating potential business ventures which
 in the opinion of management
 will provide a source of eventual profit to the Company. &nbsp;Such involvement may take many forms
As the Company possesses limited funds
 the Company will be extremely limited in its attempts to locate potential business situations for investigation. &nbsp;Mr. Bertolami intends to commence
 on a limited basis
 the process of investigating possible merger and acquisition candidates
 and believes that the Company&#146;s status as a publicly-held corporation will enhance its ability to locate such potential business ventures. &nbsp;No assurance can be given as to when the manager may locate suitable business opportunities and such opportunities may be difficult to locate; however
Management anticipates that due to its lack of funds
 and the limited amount of its resources
Business opportunities
 if any arise
 are expected to become available to the Company principally from the personal contacts of its officers and directors. &nbsp;While it is not expected that the Company will engage professional firms specializing in business acquisitions or reorganizations
 such firms may be retained if funds become available in the future
 and if deemed advisable. &nbsp;Opportunities may thus become available from professional advisors
 securities broker-dealers
 venture capitalists
 members of the financial community
 and other sources of unsolicited proposals. &nbsp;In certain circumstances
 the Company may agree to pay a finder&#146;s fee or other form of compensation
 including perhaps one-time cash payments
 payments based upon a percentage of revenues or sales volume
 and/or payments involving the issuance of securities
 for services provided by persons who submit a business opportunity in which the Company shall decide to participate
The analysis of business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company&#146;s management
 none of whom is a professional analyst and none of whom have significant general business experience. &nbsp;Among the factors which management will consider in analyzing potential business opportunities are the available technical
 financial and managerial resources; working capital and financial requirements; the history of operation
 if any; future prospects; the nature of present and anticipated competition; potential for further research
 development or exploration; growth and expansion potential; the perceived public recognition or acceptance of products or services; name identification
It is not possible at present to predict the exact matter in which the Company may participate in a business opportunity. &nbsp;Specific business opportunities will be reviewed and
 based upon such review
 the appropriate legal structure or method of participation will be decided upon by management. &nbsp;Such structures and methods may include
 without limitation
 leases
 purchase and sale agreements
 licenses
 joint ventures; and may involve merger
 consolidation or reorganization. &nbsp;The Company may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership
 corporation or reorganization. &nbsp;However
 it is most likely that any acquisition of a business venture the Company would make would be by conducting a reorganization involving the issuance of the Company&#146;s restricted securities. &nbsp;Such a reorganization may involve a merger (or combination pursuant to state corporate statutes
dissolves or is absorbed by the other)
 or it may occur as a consolidation
 where a new entity is formed and the Company and such other entity combine assets in the new entity. &nbsp;A reorganization may also occur
 directly or indirectly
 through subsidiaries
The Company may choose to enter into a venture involving the acquisition of or merger with a company which does not need substantial additional capital but desires to establish a public trading market of its securities. &nbsp;Such a company may desire to consolidate its operations with the Company through a merger
 reorganization
 asset acquisition
 or other combination
 in order to avoid possible adverse consequences of undertaking its own public offering. &nbsp;(Such consequences might include expense
 time delays or loss of voting control.) &nbsp;In the event of such a merger
 the Company may be required to issue significant additional shares
As part of their investigation of acquisition possibilities
 Mr. Bertolami may meet with executive officers of the business and its personnel; inspect its facilities; obtain independent analysis or verification of the information provided
 and conduct other reasonable measures
 to the extent permitted by the Company&#146;s limited resources and management&#146;s limited expertise. &nbsp;Generally
In all likelihood
 the Company&#146;s management will be inexperienced in the areas in which potential businesses will be investigated and in which the Company may make an acquisition or investment.&nbsp; Thus
 it may become necessary for the Company to retain consultants or outside professional firms to assist management in evaluating potential investments. &nbsp;The Company can give no assurance that it will be able to find suitable consultants or managers. &nbsp;The Company has no policy regarding the use of consultants
 however
 if management
 in its discretion
 determines that it is in the best interests of the Company
It may be anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation
 drafting and execution of relevant agreements
 disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention
 and substantial costs for accountants
 attorneys and others. Should a decision thereafter be made not to participate in a specific business opportunity
 it is likely that costs already expended would not be recoverable. &nbsp;It is likely
 in the event a transaction should eventually fail to be consummated
 for any reason
 that the costs incurred by the Company would not be recoverable. &nbsp;The Company&#146;s officers and directors are entitled to reimbursement for all expenses incurred in their investigation of possible business ventures on behalf of the Company
Based on current economic and regulatory conditions
 management believes that it is possible
 if not probable
 for a company like the Company
 without assets or many liabilities
 to negotiate a merger or acquisition with a viable private company. &nbsp;The opportunity arises principally because of the high legal and accounting fees and the length of time associated with the registration process of &#147;going public&#148;. However
 should any of these conditions change
As of December 31
 2013
 the Company had $7 in cash and $6
For the twelve months ended December 31
 2013
 the Company had $17
037 in operating expenses related to maintaining its corporate status and paying accounting and legal fees. &nbsp;Management anticipates continuing expenses related to investigating business opportunities and legal and accounting costs. &nbsp;For the year ended December 31
 2013
 the Company had a net loss of $17
501 compared to a loss of $32
008 for the year ended December 31
Since the Company ceased operations
 it has not generated significant revenue
Our management evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. &nbsp;Based on that evaluation
 our President and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are designed &nbsp;to achieve their objectives and were effective such that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i)&nbsp;recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms and (ii)&nbsp;accumulated and communicated to our management
 including our President and Principal Financial Officer
The evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our principal executive and financial officer
 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. &nbsp;Based upon that evaluation
 our management
 including our principal executive and financial officers
Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. &nbsp;Therefore
Our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2013. &nbsp;In making this assessment
 our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#147;COSO&#148;) in Internal Control&nbsp;- Integrated Framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further
 our management considered the lack of operations and revenue
 the limited cash on hand
CPA firm which reconciles all financial transactions prior to being delivered to our auditors.&nbsp; Based on this evaluation
 our management concluded that
 as of December 31
 2013
There has been no change in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected
 or is reasonably likely to materially affect

 nor has it conducted any business since current management was appointed in the reactivation on September 19
 2005. Since that time
 the Company has been investigating potential business ventures which
 in the opinion of management
 will provide a source of eventual profit. &nbsp;Such involvement may take many forms
&nbsp;&#150; The Company&#146;s financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern
 which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. &nbsp;The Company has not generated any revenue for several years and the sole officer and director of the Company has provided capital to pay prior and current obligations. &nbsp;The Company requires additional capital to continue its limited operations. &nbsp;Furthermore
 the Company&#146;s officer and director serves without compensation. &nbsp;The Company assumes that these arrangements and the availability of future capital sources will continue into the future
The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in ASC 740-20
&nbsp; Under the liability method
Pacific Ventures
For purposes of reporting cash flows
The Company plans to recognize revenue when the following four conditions are present: (1)&nbsp;persuasive evidence of an agreement exists
 (2) the price is fixed or determinable
 (3)&nbsp;delivery has occurred or services are rendered
Income (Loss) per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented. &nbsp;The Company has no potentially dilutive securities
 in 2013 and 2012. &nbsp;Accordingly
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents
The Company has reviewed recently issued
 but not yet adopted
 accounting standards in order to determine their effects
 if any
 on its results of operations
 financial position or cash flows. &nbsp;Based on that review
Due to losses at December 31
 2013 and 2012
 the Company had no income tax liability. &nbsp;At December 31
 2013 and 2012
 the Company had available unused operating loss carry forwards of approximately $108
194 and $90
693
 respectively
The amount of and ultimate realization of the benefits from the operating loss carry forwards for income tax purposes is dependent
 in part
 upon the tax laws in effect
 the future earnings of the Company and other future events
 the effects of which cannot be determined at this time. &nbsp;Because of the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the loss carry forwards
 the Company has established a valuation allowance equal to the tax effect of the loss carry forwards and
 therefore
 no deferred tax asset has been recognized for the loss carry forwards. &nbsp;The net deferred tax assets are approximately $40
356 and $33
828 as of December 31
 2013 and 2012
Pacific Ventures
respectively
 with an offsetting valuation allowance of the same amount resulting in a change in the valuation allowance of approximately $6

The Company has no tax positions at December 31
 2013 and 2012
 for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. &nbsp;The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. &nbsp;During the period ended December 31
 2013 and 2012
 the Company recognized no interest and penalties. &nbsp;The Company had no accruals for interest and penalties at December 31
 2013 and 2012. &nbsp;Under the rules of the Internal Revenue Service
&nbsp;&#150; The Company&#146;s Board of Directors is expressly granted the authority to issue
 without stockholder action

 nor has it conducted any business since current management was appointed in the reactivation on September 19
 2005. Since that time
 the Company has been investigating potential business ventures which
 in the opinion of management
 will provide a source of eventual profit.&amp;#160; Such involvement may take many forms
 including the acquisition of an existing business or the acquisition of assets to establish subsidiary businesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-autospace:none;text-align:justify&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-autospace:none;text-align:justify&apos;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Going&amp;nbsp;Concern&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#150; The Company&amp;#146;s financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern

&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#147;Accounting for Income Taxes.&amp;#148;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp; Under the liability method
 deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. &amp;nbsp;An allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will not be realized.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-autospace:none;text-align:justify&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-autospace:none;text-align:justify&apos;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Estimates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-autospace:none;text-align:justify&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-autospace:none;text-align:justify&apos;&gt;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-autospace:none;text-align:justify&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-autospace:none;text-align:justify&apos;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cash and Cash Equivalents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-autospace:none;text-align:justify&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-autospace:none;text-align:justify&apos;&gt;For purposes of reporting cash flows

 basic and dilutive loss per common share are the same.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-autospace:none;text-align:justify&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-autospace:none;text-align:justify&apos;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fair Value&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-autospace:none;text-align:justify&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-autospace:none;text-align:justify&apos;&gt;The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents

 but not yet adopted
 accounting standards in order to determine their effects
 if any
 on its results of operations
 financial position or cash flows.&amp;#160; Based on that review


 2013 and 2012
 the Company had no income tax liability. &amp;nbsp;At December 31
 2013 and 2012
 the Company had available unused operating loss carry forwards of approximately $108
194 and $90
693
 respectively
 which may be applied against future taxable income and which expire in various years through 2033.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-autospace:none;text-align:justify&apos;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&apos;margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-autospace:none;text-align:justify&apos;&gt;The amount of and ultimate realization of the benefits from the operating loss carry forwards for income tax purposes is dependent
 in part
 upon the tax laws in effect
 the future earnings of the Company and other future events
 the effects of which cannot be determined at this time.&amp;#160; Because of the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the loss carry forwards
 the Company has established a valuation allowance equal to the tax effect of the loss carry forwards and
 therefore
 no deferred tax asset has been recognized for the loss carry forwards.&amp;#160; The net deferred tax assets are approximately $40
356 and $33
828 as of December 31
 2013 and 2012
 respectively

Due to losses at December 31
 2013 and 2012
 the Company had no income tax liability. &nbsp;At December 31
 2013 and 2012
 the Company had available unused operating loss carry forwards of approximately $108
194 and $90
693
 respectively
The amount of and ultimate realization of the benefits from the operating loss carry forwards for income tax purposes is dependent
 in part
 upon the tax laws in effect
 the future earnings of the Company and other future events
 the effects of which cannot be determined at this time.&#160; Because of the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the loss carry forwards
 the Company has established a valuation allowance equal to the tax effect of the loss carry forwards and
 therefore
 no deferred tax asset has been recognized for the loss carry forwards.&#160; The net deferred tax assets are approximately $40
356 and $33
828 as of December 31
 2013 and 2012
 respectively
 with an offsetting valuation allowance of the same amount resulting in a change in the valuation allowance of approximately $ 6
528 during the year ended December 31

The Company has no tax positions at December 31
 2013 and 2012
 for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.&#160; The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses.&#160; During the period ended December 31
 2013 and 2012
 the Company recognized no interest and penalties.&#160; The Company had no accruals for interest and penalties at December 31
 2013 and 2012.&#160; Under the rules of the Internal Revenue Service
 the Company's tax returns for the previous three years remain open for examination.

 (2) the price is fixed or determinable
 (3)&nbsp;delivery has occurred or services are rendered
Income (Loss) per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented. &nbsp;The Company has no potentially dilutive securities
 in 2013 and 2012. &#160;Accordingly
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents
The Company has reviewed recently issued
 but not yet adopted
 accounting standards in order to determine their effects
 if any
 on its results of operations
 financial position or cash flows.&#160; Based on that review
 the Company believes that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on its financial statements.

 Development Stage Company
 nor has it conducted any business since current management was appointed in the reactivation on September 19
 2005. Since that time
 the Company has been investigating potential business ventures which
 in the opinion of management
 will provide a source of eventual profit.&#160; Such involvement may take many forms
 including the acquisition of an existing business or the acquisition of assets to establish subsidiary businesses.


        
&nbsp;&#150; The Company&#146;s financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern
 which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.&#160; The Company has not generated any revenue for several years and the sole officer and director of the Company has provided capital to pay prior and current obligations.&#160; The Company requires additional capital to continue its limited operations.&#160; Furthermore
 the Company&#146;s officer and director serves without compensation.&#160; The Company assumes that these arrangements and the availability of future capital sources will continue into the future
 but no assurance thereof can be given.&#160; A change in these circumstances would have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern.&#160; The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.


        
The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in ASC 740-20
&nbsp; Under the liability method
 deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. &nbsp;An allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will not be realized.


        
        


        
For purposes of reporting cash flows
 the Company considers all highly-liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.


        
The Company plans to recognize revenue when the following four conditions are present: (1)&nbsp;persuasive evidence of an agreement exists
 (2) the price is fixed or determinable
 (3)&nbsp;delivery has occurred or services are rendered
 and (4)&nbsp;collection is reasonably assured.


        
Income (Loss) per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented. &nbsp;The Company has no potentially dilutive securities
 in 2013 and 2012. &#160;Accordingly
 basic and dilutive loss per common share are the same.


        
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents
 and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term maturity of these financial instruments.


        
The Company has reviewed recently issued
 but not yet adopted
 accounting standards in order to determine their effects
 if any
 on its results of operations
 financial position or cash flows.&#160; Based on that review
 the Company believes that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on its financial statements.




        
          

        
          
            

 including the policy for determining which items are treated as cash equivalents. Other information that may be disclosed includes (1) the nature of any restrictions on the entity's use of its cash and cash equivalents
 (2) whether the entity's cash and cash equivalents are insured or expose the entity to credit risk
 (3) the classification of any negative balance accounts (overdrafts)
 and (4) the carrying basis of cash equivalents (for example
 at cost) and whether the carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value.

 the policy for each material type of transaction is generally disclosed. If a sales transaction has multiple element arrangements (for example
 delivery of multiple products
 services or the rights to use assets) the disclosure may indicate the accounting policy for each unit of accounting as well as how units of accounting are determined and valued. The disclosure may encompass important judgment as to appropriateness of principles related to recognition of revenue. The disclosure also may indicate the entity's treatment of any unearned or deferred revenue that arises from the transaction.
