PART
I



    
    


General
Overview

Products
 We are an integrated wholesale coffee roaster and dealer in the United States. Our core products can be
divided into three categories:



    
    
Wholesale
 unroasted raw beans imported from around the world and sold to large and small roasters and coffee shop
    operators;

    
    
    

    
    
Private Label
 coffee roasted
 blended
 packaged and sold under the specifications and names of others
 including supermarkets
    that want to have their own brand name on coffee to compete with national brands; and

    
    
    

    
    
Branded Coffee:
coffee roasted and blended to our own specifications and packaged and sold under our eight proprietary and licensed
    brand names in different segments of the market.


Our
private label and branded coffee products are sold throughout the United States
 Canada and certain countries in Asia to supermarkets
wholesalers
 and individually owned and multi-unit retail customers. Our unprocessed green coffee
 which includes over 90 specialty
coffee offerings
 is primarily sold to specialty gourmet roasters.

We
conduct our operations in accordance with strict freshness and quality standards. All of our private label and branded coffees
are produced from high quality coffee beans that are deep roasted for full flavor using a slow roasting process that has been
perfected utilizing our more than 39 years of experience in the coffee industry. In order to ensure freshness
 our products are
delivered to our customers within 72 hours of roasting. We believe that our long history has enabled us to develop a loyal customer
base.

In
June 2016
 we acquired substantially all of the assets of Coffee Kinetics LLC (doing business as Sonofresco) through our wholly-owned
subsidiary Sonofresco
 LLC (&ldquo;Sonofresco&rdquo; or &ldquo;SONO&rdquo;)
 including equipment
 inventory
 customer lists
 relationships
and accounts payable. In addition to our wholesale green coffee
 private label coffee and branded coffee product offerings
 we
currently sell tabletop coffee roasting equipment to our customers through Sonofresco.

On
April 24
 2018
 pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement
 by and among Generations Coffee Company
 LLC (&ldquo;GCC&rdquo;) the
entity formed as a result of the Company&rsquo;s joint venture with Caruso&rsquo;s Coffee
 Inc. and Steep &amp; Brew
 Inc. (&ldquo;the
Seller&rdquo;) a Wisconsin corporation and the stockholder of the Seller. GCC purchased substantially all the assets
 including
equipment
 inventory
 customer lists and relationships of the Seller.

On
February 23
 2017
 we purchased all the outstanding common stock of Comfort Foods
 Inc. (&ldquo;CFI&rdquo;). CFI is a medium sized
regional roaster
 manufacturing both branded and private label coffee for retail and foodservice customers located predominantly
in the northeast United States marketplace.

We
were incorporated on October 9
 1995 under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name Transpacific International Group Corp
(&ldquo;Transpacific&rdquo;). On April 16
 1998
 Transpacific completed a merger with Coffee Holding Co.
 Inc.
 a New York corporation.
Upon the consummation of the merger
 Coffee Holding Co.
 Inc. was merged into Transpacific and Transpacific changed its name to
Coffee Holding Co.
 Inc.

Our
corporate offices are located at 3475 Victory Boulevard
 Staten Island
 New York 10314. Our telephone number is (718) 832-0800
and our website address is www.coffeeholding.com. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.


    
    


Our
Competitive Strengths

To
achieve our growth objectives described below
 we intend to leverage the following competitive strengths:

Positioned
We believe that we are one of the few coffee companies
to offer a broad array of branded and private label roasted ground coffees and wholesale green coffee across the spectrum of consumer
tastes
 preferences and price points. While many of our competitors engage in distinct segments of the coffee business
 we sell
products in each of the following areas:



    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
Specialty
    retail coffees both private label and branded;

    
    
    

    
    
Wholesale
    specialty green and gourmet whole bean coffees;

    
    
    

    
    
Single
    cup coffee pods;

    
    
    

    
    
Food
    service;

    
    
    

    
    
Instant
    coffees; 

    
    
    

    
    
Tea;
    and

    
    
Tabletop
    coffee roasting equipment.


Our
branded and private label roasted ground coffees are sold at competitive and value price levels while some of our other branded
and specialty coffees are sold predominantly at premium price levels. Premium price level coffee is high-quality gourmet coffee
such as AA Arabica coffee
 which sell at a substantial premium over traditional retail canned coffee
 while competitive and value
price level coffee is mainstream or traditional canned coffee. Because of this diversification
 we believe that our profitability
is not dependent on any one area of the coffee industry and
 therefore
 is less sensitive than our competition to potential coffee
commodity price and overall economic volatility.

Wholesale
 As a large roaster-dealer of green coffee
 we believe that we are favorably positioned to
increase our specialty coffee sales. Since 1998
 we have increased the number of our wholesale green coffee customers
 including
coffee houses
 single store operators
 mall coffee stores and mail order sellers
 by 739% from 150 to 1
259. We are a charter
member of the Specialty Coffee Association of America and one of the largest distributors of Swiss Water Processed Decaffeinated
Coffees and Datteral specialty Brazil coffees along the east coast of the United States. Our over 40 years of experience as a
roaster and a dealer of green coffee allows us to provide our roasting experience as a value added service to our gourmet roaster
customers. The assistance we provide to our customers includes training
 coffee blending and market identification. We believe
that our relationships with wholesale green coffee customers and our focus on selling green coffee as a wholesaler has enabled
us to participate in the growth of the specialty coffee market while mitigating the risks associated with the competitive retail
specialty coffee environment.

Diverse
We have amassed a portfolio of eight proprietary name brands sold to supermarkets
wholesalers and individually owned stores in the United States
 including brands for specialty espresso
 Latin espresso
 Italian
espresso
 100% Colombian coffee and blended and flavored coffees. In addition
 we have entered into a licensing agreement with
Del Monte Corporation for the exclusive right to use the S&amp;W trademark in the United States and other countries approved by
Del Monte Corporation in connection with the production
 manufacture and sale of roasted whole bean and ground coffee for distribution
to retail customers. Our existing portfolio of differentiated brands combined with our management expertise serve as a platform
to add additional name brands through acquisition or licensing agreements which target product niches and segments that do not
compete with our existing brands.


    
    


Management
 We have been a family-operated business for three generations. Throughout
this time
 we have remained strong through varying cycles in the coffee industry and the economy. Andrew Gordon
 our President
Chief Executive Officer
 Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
 and David Gordon
 our Executive Vice President &ndash; Operations
have worked with Coffee Holding for 37 and 39 years
 respectively. David Gordon is an original member of the Specialty Coffee
Association of America. We believe that our employees and management are dedicated to our vision and mission
 which is to produce
high quality products
 as well as to provide quality and responsive service to our customers.

Our
Growth Strategy

We
believe that significant growth opportunities exist by selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions and alliances
 targeting the
rapidly growing Latin market in the United States
 increasing penetration with existing customers by adding new products
 and
developing our food service business. By capitalizing on this strategy
 we hope to continue to grow our business with our commitment
to quality and personalized service to our customers. We do not intend to compete on price alone nor do we intend to expand sales
at the expense of profitability.

Selectively
 We have expanded our operations by acquiring coffee companies
 entering into
strategic alliances and acquiring or licensing brands
 which complement our business objectives and we intend to continue to seek
such opportunities.

Grow
We believe the Latin population in the United States is the fastest growing
and now represents the largest minority demographic in the United States. We believe there is significant opportunity for our
Caf&eacute; Caribe and Caf&eacute; Supremo brands to gain market share among Latin consumers in the United States. Caf&eacute;
Caribe
 which has historically been our leading brand by poundage
 is a specialty espresso coffee that targets espresso coffee
drinkers and
 in particular
 Latin consumers. Caf&eacute; Supremo is a specialty espresso coffee which is priced for the more
price sensitive Latin espresso coffee drinker.

Further
 We intend to capture additional market share through our existing distribution
channels by selectively adding or introducing new brand names and products across multiple price points
 including:



    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
Specialty blends
    and foodservice opportunities;

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
Sales of our tabletop
    coffee roasting equipment.



    
    


Our
Core Products

Our
core products can be divided into three categories:



    
    
Wholesale
unroasted raw beans imported from around the world and sold to large
 medium and small roasters and
    coffee shop operators;

    
    
    

    
    
Private Label
coffee roasted
 blended
 packaged and sold under the specifications and names of others
 including supermarkets
    that want to have their own brand name on coffee to compete with national brands; and

    
    
    

    
    
:
    
    names in different segments of the market.


Wholesale
 The specialty coffee market represents the fastest growing area of our industry. The number of gourmet coffee
houses have been increasing in all areas of the United States. The growth in specialty coffee sales has created a marketplace
for higher quality and differentiated products
 which can be priced at a premium in the marketplace. As a large roaster-dealer
of green coffee
 we are favorably positioned to increase our specialty coffee sales. We sell green coffee beans to small roasters
and coffee shop operators located throughout the United States and carry over approximately 90 different varieties. Specialty
green coffee beans are sold unroasted
 direct from warehouses to small roasters and gourmet coffee shop operators
 which then
roast the beans themselves. We sell from as little as one bag (132 pounds) to a full truckload (44
000 pounds) of specialty green
coffee beans
 depending on the size and need of the customer. We believe that we can increase sales of wholesale green coffee
without an increase in infrastructure as well as without venturing into the highly competitive retail specialty coffee environment.
We believe that by utilizing our current strategy we can be as profitable or more profitable than our competitors in this segment
by selling &ldquo;one bag at a time&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;one cup at a time.&rdquo;

Private
 We roast
 blend
 package and sell coffee under private labels for companies throughout the United States
and Canada. Our private label coffee is sold in cans
 brick packages and instants in a variety of sizes. As of October 31
 2019
 We produce private label coffee
for customers who desire to sell coffee under their own name but do not want to engage in the manufacturing process. Our private
label customers seek a quality similar to the national brands at a lower cost
 which represents a better value for the consumer.

Branded
. We roast and blend our branded coffee according to our own recipes and package the coffee at our facilities in
La Junta
 Colorado
 North Andover
 Massachusetts and Brecksville
 Ohio. We then sell the packaged coffee under our brand labels
to supermarkets
 wholesalers and individually-owned stores throughout the United States.

We
hold trademarks for each of our proprietary name brands and have the exclusive right to use the S&amp;W
 IL CLASSICO brand names
in the United States in connection with the production
 manufacture and sale of roasted whole bean and ground coffee for distribution
at the retail level. For further information regarding our trademark rights
 see &ldquo;Business&mdash;Trademarks.&rdquo;

Each
of our name brands is directed at a particular segment of the coffee market. Our branded coffees are:

Cafe
Caribe
 a specialty espresso coffee that targets espresso coffee drinkers and
 in particular
 the Latin consumer market;


    
    


Don
Manuel

a substantial premium compared to the more traditional brown coffee blends. We also use this known trademark in our food service
business because of the high brand quality;


an upscale canned coffee established in 1921 and includes Premium
 Premium Decaf
 French Roast
 Colombian
 Colombian Decaf
 Swiss
Water Decaf
 Kona
 Mellow&rsquo;d Roast and IL CLASSICO lines;

coffee drinkers to the tastes of dark roasted coffee;

 a line of high quality retail and foodservice products packed in composite cans and poly bags and single serve;

Harmony

 Blended and Flavored coffees sold throughout the upper Midwest region of the United States in bulk whole bean
 whole bean
and ground bags and single serve format compatible with most single serve brewers; and

Caf&eacute;
Fair
 one of the most certified lines of coffee on the market. These coffees are Fair Trade Organic coffees with additional
certifications including Kosher
 Rainforest Alliance
 and Certified Bird Friendly. These coffees are available in bag
 bulk whole
bean and single serve.

Other
Products

We
also offer several niche products
 including:



    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    


Raw
Materials

Coffee
is a commodity traded on the Commodities and Futures Exchange subject to price fluctuations. Over the past five years
 the average
price per pound of coffee beans ranged from approximately $0.92 to $2.25. The price for coffee beans on the commodities market
as of October 31
 2019 and 2018 was $1.02 and $1.12 per pound
 respectively. Specialty green coffee
 unlike most coffee
 is not
tied directly to the commodities cash markets. Instead
 it tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a substantial premium over
commodity coffee pricing
 depending on the origin
 supply and demand at the time of purchase. We are a licensed Fair Trade dealer
for Fair Trade certified coffee. Fair Trade certified coffee helps small coffee farmers to increase their incomes and improve
the prospects of their communities and families by guaranteeing farmers a minimum price of ten cents above the current market
price. Our Ohio Facility operated by Generations Coffee Company
 LLC (&ldquo;GCC&rdquo;) is certified organic by the Organic Crop
Improvement Association (OCIA). All of our specialty green coffees
 as well as all of the other coffees we import for roasting
are subject to multiple levels of quality control.

We
purchase our green coffee from dealers located primarily within the United States. The dealers supply us with coffee beans from
many countries
 including Colombia
 Mexico
 Kenya
 Indonesia
 Brazil and Uganda. For the fiscal years ended 2019 and 2018
 approximately
26% of all of our green coffee purchases were from five suppliers. One of these suppliers
 Rothfos Corporation
 accounted for
approximately $8.3 million
 or 12%
 in 2019
 and $9.1 million
 or 13%
 in 2018
 of our total product purchases. An employee of
Rothfos Corporation is one of our directors. We do not have any formalized
 material agreements or long-term contracts with any
of these suppliers. Rather
 our purchases are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders. We do not believe that the
loss of any one supplier
 including Rothfos
 would have a material adverse effect on our operations due to the availability of
alternate suppliers.


    
    


The
supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control.
Supply and price can be affected by factors such as weather
 politics
 currency fluctuations and economics within the countries
that export coffee. Increases in the cost of coffee beans can
 to a certain extent
 be passed on to our customers in the form
of higher prices for coffee beans and processed coffee. Drastic or prolonged increases in coffee prices may also adversely impact
our business as it could lead to a decline in overall consumption of coffee. Similarly
 rapid decreases in the cost of coffee
beans may force us to lower our sale prices before realizing cost reductions in our purchases.

We
subject all of our private unroasted green coffee to both a pre-shipment sample approval and an additional sample approval upon
arrival into the United States. Once the arrival sample is approved
 we then bring the coffee to one of our facilities to roast
and blend according to our own strict specifications. During the roasting and blending process
 samples are pulled off the production
line and tested on an hourly basis to ensure that each batch roasted is consistent with the others and meets the strict quality
standards demanded by our customers and us.

Our
Use of Derivatives

The
supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control.
Historically
 we have used
 and intend to continue to use in a limited capacity
 short-term coffee futures and options contracts
primarily for the purpose of partially hedging the effects of changing green coffee prices and to reduce our costs of sales


 we acquired
and expect to continue to acquire
 futures contracts with longer terms
 generally three to four months
 primarily for the purpose
of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on options and futures contracts are
reflected in our cost of sales. Gains on options and futures contracts reduce our cost of sales and losses on options and futures
contracts increase our cost of sales. The use of these derivative financial instruments has generally enabled us to mitigate the

 in normal economic times
 our hedging policies
remain a vital element of our business model not only in controlling our cost of sales
 but also giving us the flexibility to
obtain the inventory necessary to continue to grow our sales while trying to minimize margin compression during a time of high
coffee prices. However

contracts when prices decline significantly in a short period of time
 and we would generally remain exposed to supply risk in

we have had net gains on options and futures contracts in the past
 we have incurred significant losses on options and futures
contracts during some reporting periods. In these cases
 our cost of sales has increased
 resulting in a decrease in our profitability
or increase our losses. Such losses have and could in the future materially increase our cost of sales and materially decrease
our profitability and adversely affect our stock price. See &ldquo;Item 1A &ndash; Risk Factors - If our hedging policy is not
effective
 we may not be able to control our coffee costs
 we may be forced to pay greater than market value for green coffee

materially adversely affect our business and operating results. If the hedges that we enter do not adequately offset the risks
of coffee bean price volatility or our hedges result in losses
 our cost of sales may increase
 resulting in a decrease in profitability
or increased losses. As previously announced
 as a result of the volatile nature of the commodities markets
 we have and are continuing
to scale back our use of hedging and short-term trading of coffee futures and options contracts
 and intend to continue to use
these practices in a limited capacity going forward. See &ldquo;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&mdash;Commodity
Price Risks.&rdquo;


    
    


Trademarks
and Tradename

We
hold trademarks
 registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office
 for all eight of our proprietary coffee brands
and an exclusive license for S&amp;W
 IL CLASSICO brands for sale in the United States. Trademark registrations are subject to
periodic renewal and we anticipate maintaining our registrations. We believe that our brands are recognizable in the marketplace
and that brand recognition is important to the success of our branded coffee business.



We
sell our private label and our branded coffee to some of the largest retail and wholesale customers in the United States (according
to 

Although
our agreements with wholesale customers generally contain only pricing terms
 our contracts with certain customers also contain
minimum and maximum purchase obligations at fixed prices. Because our profits on a fixed-price contract could decline if coffee
prices increased
 we acquire futures contracts with longer terms (generally three to four months) primarily for the purpose of
guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee at favorable prices. Although the use of these derivative financial instruments
has generally enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices
 no strategy can entirely eliminate pricing risks or increased
losses and we generally remain exposed to losses on futures contracts when prices decline significantly in a short period of time
and we would generally remain exposed to supply risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to any futures contracts.
See &ldquo;Our Use of Derivatives.&rdquo;



We
market our private label and wholesale coffee through trade shows
 industry publications
 face-to-face contact and through the
use of our internal sales force and non-exclusive independent food and beverage sales brokers. We also use our web site (www.coffeeholding.com)
as a method of marketing our coffee products and ourselves.

For
our private label and branded coffees
 we will
 from time to time in conjunction with retailers and with wholesalers
 conduct
in-store promotions
 such as product demonstrations
 coupons
 price reductions
 two-for-one sales and new product launches to
capture changing consumer taste preferences for upscale canned
 bagged and single cup coffees.

We
evaluate opportunities for growth consistent with our business objectives. In addition
 we have established relationships with
independent sales brokers to market our products across the United States
 in areas of the country where we have not had a high
penetration of sales and Canada. We utilize our in-house sales personnel to market our private label brands. We intend to capture
additional market share in our existing distribution channels by selectively adding or introducing new brand names and products
across multiple price points
 including niche specialty blends
 private label &ldquo;value&rdquo; blends and tea and our own brands
filter packages
 and peripheral products.

Charitable
Activities

We
are also a supporter of several coffee-oriented charitable organizations and during fiscal 2019 and 2018
 we donated approximately
$42
000 and $51
000
 respectively
 to charities.



    
    
For over 20 years
    we have been members of Coffee Kids
 an international non-profit organization that helps to improve the quality of life of
    children and their families in coffee-growing communities in Mexico
 Guatemala
 Nicaragua and Costa Rica.



    
    




    
    
We are members of
    Grounds for Health
 an organization that educates
 screens
 and arranges treatment for women who have cancer and live in the
    rural coffee growing communities of Mexico.

    
    
    

    
    
We are a licensed
    Fair Trade dealer of Fair Trade certified coffee. Fair Trade certified coffee helps small coffee farmers to increase their
    incomes and improve the prospects of their communities and families. It guarantees farmers a minimum price of $1.40 per pound
    or fifteen cents above the current market price.

    
    
    

    
    
We are the administrative
    benefactors to a non-profit organization called Cup for Education. After discovering the lack of schools
 teachers
 and basic
    fundamental learning supplies in the poor coffee growing communities of Central and Latin America
 &ldquo;Cup&rdquo; was established
    by our employee
 Karen Gordon
 to help build schools
 sponsor teachers
 and purchase basic supplies such as books
 chalk and
    other necessities for a proper education.




The
coffee market is highly competitive. We compete in the following areas:

Wholesale
 There are many green coffee dealers throughout the United States. Many of these dealers have greater financial
resources than we do. However
 we believe that we have both the knowledge and the capability to assist small specialty gourmet
coffee roasters with developing and growing their businesses. Our over 40 years of experience as a roaster and a dealer of green
coffee allows us to provide our roasting experience as a value added service to our gourmet roaster customers. While other coffee
merchants may be able to offer lower prices for coffee beans
 we market ourselves as a value-added supplier to small roasters
with the ability to help them market their specialty coffee products and develop a customer base. The assistance we provide our
customers includes training
 coffee blending and market identification. Because specialty green coffee beans are sold unroasted
to small coffee shops and roasters that market their products to local gourmet customers
 we do not believe that our specialty
green coffee customers compete with our private label or branded coffee lines of business. We believe that the addition of Organic
Products Trading Company
 LLC (&ldquo;OPTCO&rdquo;)
 Sonofresco
 CFI and and Steep &amp; Brew as well as our external green coffee
salespeople allows us to compete more effectively throughout the country and Canada.

Private
 There are several major producers of coffee for private label sales in the United States. Many other
companies produce coffee for sale on a regional basis. Our main competitor is the Massimo Zanetti Beverage Company. The Massimo
Zanetti Beverage Company is larger and has more financial and other resources than we do and
 therefore
 is able to devote more
resources to product development and marketing. We believe that we remain competitive by providing a higher level of quality and
customer service. This service includes ensuring that the coffee produced for each label maintains a consistent taste and is delivered
on time and in the proper quantities.

Branded
 Our proprietary brand coffees compete with many other brands that are sold in supermarkets and specialty
stores
 primarily in the Northeastern United States. The branded coffee market in both the Northeast and elsewhere is dominated
by three large companies: Kraft Foods
 Inc. (owner of the Maxwell House brand)
 J.M. Smucker Co. (owner of the Folgers and Caf&eacute;
Bustelo brands) and Massimo Zanetti Beverage Group which also markets specialty coffee in addition to non-specialty coffee. Our
large competitors have greater access to capital and a greater ability to conduct marketing and promotions. We believe that
 while
our competitors&rsquo; brands may be more nationally recognizable
 our Caf&eacute; Caribe and Caf&eacute; Supremo brands are competitive
in the fast growing Latin demographic and our S&amp;W brand has been a popular and recognizable brand on the west coast for over
80 years.

Government
Regulation

Our
coffee roasting operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations
 which require us to obtain licenses relating
to customs
 health and safety
 building and land use and environmental protection. Our roasting facility is subject to state and
local air-quality and emissions regulation. If we encounter difficulties in obtaining any necessary licenses or if we have difficulty
complying with these laws and regulations
 then we could be subject to fines and penalties
 which could have a material adverse
effect on our profitability. In addition
 our product offerings could be limited
 thereby reducing our revenues.


    
    


We
believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all such laws and regulations and that we have obtained all material
licenses and permits that are required for the operation of our business. We are not aware of any environmental regulations that
have or that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our operations.



We
have 79 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by unions or collective bargaining agreements. Our management
believes that we maintain good working relationships with our employees. To supplement our internal sales staff
 we sometimes
engage independent national and regional sales brokers as independent contractors who work on a commission basis.



    
    


An
investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision
 you should
carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this report.
In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below
 other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we
currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.
The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks
 and you could lose
all of your investment.

Risks
affecting our Company

Because
our business is highly dependent upon a single commodity
 coffee
 any decrease in demand for coffee could materially adversely
 Our business is centered on essentially one commodity: coffee. Our operations have
primarily focused on the following areas of the coffee industry:



    
    
the roasting
 blending
 packaging and distribution
    of private label coffee;

    
    
    

    
    
the roasting
 blending
 packaging and distribution
    of proprietary branded coffee; and

    
    
    

    
    
    


Demand
for our products is affected by:



    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
the type
 number and location of competing products.


Because
we rely on a single commodity
 any decrease in demand for coffee would harm our business more than if we had more diversified
product offerings and could materially adversely affect our revenues and operating results.


    
    


If
we are unable to geographically expand our branded and private label products
 our growth will be impeded which could result in
Our business strategy emphasizes
 among other things
 geographic expansion of our branded
and private label products as opportunities arise. We may not be able to implement successfully this portion of our business strategy.
Our ability to implement this portion of our business strategy is dependent on our ability to:



    
    
market
    our products on a national scale;

    
    
    

    
    
increase our brand
    recognition on a national scale;

    
    
    

    
    
enter into distribution
    and other strategic arrangements with third party retailers; and

    
    
    

    
    
manage growth in
    administrative overhead and distribution costs likely to result from the planned expansion of our distribution channels.


Our
sales and profitability may be adversely affected if we fail to successfully expand the geographic distribution of our branded
and private label products. In addition
 our expenses could increase and our profits could decrease as we implement our growth
strategy.

If
our hedging policy is not effective
 we may not be able to control our coffee costs
 we may be forced to pay greater than market
The supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility
and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control. We have used and expect to continue to use to a lesser extent
short-term coffee futures and options contracts for the purpose of hedging the effects of changing green coffee prices. In addition
we have acquired and expect to continue to acquire to a lesser extent futures contracts with longer terms
 generally three to
four months
 for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on options
and futures contracts are reflected in our cost of sales. Gains on options and futures contracts reduce our cost of sales and
losses on options and futures contracts increase our cost of sales.

The
use of these derivative financial instruments has generally enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices. However
 no
strategy can entirely eliminate pricing risks and we generally remain exposed to losses on futures contracts when prices decline
significantly in a short period of time
 and we would generally remain exposed to supply risk in the event of non-performance
by the counterparties in any one of our physical contracts. Historically
 we generally have been able to pass green coffee price
increases through to customers
 thereby maintaining our gross profits
 however
 we may not be able to pass price increases through
to our customers in the future. Failure to properly design and implement an effective hedging strategy may materially adversely
affect our business and operating results. If the hedges that we enter do not adequately offset the risks of coffee bean price
volatility or our hedging results in losses
 our cost of sales may increase
 resulting in a decrease in profitability or an increase
in losses. Although we have had net gains on options and futures contracts in the past
 we have incurred losses on options and
futures contracts during some reporting periods. In these cases
 our cost of sales has increased
 resulting in a decrease in our
profitability or an increase in losses. Such losses have and could in the future materially increase our cost of sales and materially
decrease our profitability or increase losses and adversely affect our stock price.


    
    


Any
inability to successfully implement our strategy of growth through selective acquisitions
 licensing arrangements and other strategic
alliances
 including joint ventures
Part of our growth strategy
utilizes the selective acquisition of coffee companies
 the selective acquisition or licensing of additional coffee brands and
other strategic alliances including joint ventures
 presents risks that could result in increased expenditures and could materially
adversely affect our revenues and profitability
 including:



    
    
such acquisitions
    licensing arrangements or other strategic alliances may divert our management&rsquo;s attention from our existing operations;

    
    
    

    
    
we may not be able
    to successfully integrate any acquired coffee companies or new coffee brands into our existing business;

    
    
    

    
    
we may not be able
    to manage the contingent risks associated with the past operations of
 and other unanticipated problems arising in
 any acquired
    coffee company; and

    
    
    

    
    
we may not be able
    to control unanticipated costs associated with such acquisitions
 licensing arrangements or strategic alliances.


In
addition
 any such acquisitions
 licensing arrangements or strategic alliances may result in:



    
    
potentially dilutive
    issuances of our equity securities;

    
    
    

    
    
the incurrence of
    additional debt

    
    
    

    
    
restructuring charges;
    and

    
    
    

    
    
the recognition
    of significant charges for depreciation and amortization related to intangible assets.


As
has been our practice in the past
 we will continuously evaluate any such acquisitions
 licensing opportunities or strategic alliances
as they arise. However
 we have not reached any new agreements or arrangements with respect to any such acquisition
 licensing
opportunity or strategic alliance (other than those described herein) at this time and we may not be able to consummate any acquisitions
licensing arrangements or strategic alliances on terms favorable to us or at all. The failure to consummate any such acquisitions
licensing arrangements or strategic alliances may reduce our growth and expansion. In addition
 if these acquisitions
 licensing
opportunities or strategic alliances are not successful
 our earnings could be materially adversely affected by increased expenses
and decreased revenues.

Our
 We have
historically utilized joint ventures and acquisitions to grow our business and we intend to continue to seek opportunities for
new joint ventures and acquisitions that will be complimentary to our business. While we believe that our joint ventures will
be successful
 losses in our joint ventures or any future joint ventures would hurt our profitability. In addition
 we generally
will not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding our joint ventures. Investments in joint ventures
may under certain circumstances
 involve risks not present when a third party is not involved
 including the possibility that
joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of the required capital contributions. Joint venture
partners may have business interests
 strategies or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests
 strategies or goals
and may be
 in cases where we have a minority interest
 in a position to take actions contrary to our policies
 strategies or
objectives. Any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that
could increase our expenses and could prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort exclusively on
our business strategies. In addition
 we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party joint venture
partners.


    
    


Acquisitions
including strategic investments or alliances entail numerous risks
 which may include:



    
    
difficulties in
    integrating acquired operations or products
 including the loss of key employees from
 or customers of
 acquired businesses;

    
    
    

    
    
diversion of management&rsquo;s
    attention from our existing businesses;

    
    
    

    
    
adverse effects
    on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; 

    
    
    

    
    
adverse impacts
    of margin and product cost structures different from those of our current mix of business; and 

    
    
    

    
    
risks of entering
    distribution channels
 categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience.


Our
failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business
 and any adverse consequences associated with our acquisition
activities
 could have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and operating results.

The
loss of any of our key customers
 No one customer accounted
for greater than 10% of our net sales during our 2019 fiscal year. We generally do not enter long-term contracts with most of
our customers
 but we do enter into one and two year agreements with most our key customers on our private label business. Accordingly
some of our customers can stop purchasing our products at any time without penalty and are free to purchase products from our
competitors. The loss of
 or reduction in sales to any of our other customers to which we sell a significant amount of our products
or any material adverse change in the financial condition of such customers would negatively affect our revenues and decrease
our earnings.

If
we lose our key personnel
 including Andrew Gordon and David Gordon
 Our
success depends to a large degree upon the services of Andrew Gordon
 our President
 Chief Executive Officer
 Chief Financial
Officer and Treasurer
 and David Gordon
 our Executive Vice President &ndash; Operations and Secretary. We also depend to a large
degree on the expertise of our coffee roasters. We do not have employment contracts with our coffee roasters. Our ability to source
and purchase a sufficient supply of high quality coffee beans and to roast coffee beans consistent with our quality standards
could suffer if we lose the services of any of these individuals. As a result
 our business and operating results would be adversely
affected. We may not be successful in obtaining and retaining a replacement for either Andrew Gordon or David Gordon if they elect
to stop working for us. In addition
 we do not have key-person insurance on the lives of Andrew Gordon or David Gordon.


    
    


Our
indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional funds and may increase our vulnerability to economic or business
From time to time
 we utilize borrowings under our credit facility in connection with operations. Outstanding
debt could have important negative consequences to the holders of our securities
 including the following:



    
    
general domestic
    and global economic conditions;

    
    
    

    
    
a portion of our
    cash flow from operations will be needed to pay debt service and will not be available to fund future operations;

    
    
    

    
    
we have increased
    vulnerability to adverse general economic and coffee industry conditions;

    
    
    

    
    
we may be vulnerable
    to higher interest rates because interest expense on borrowings under our revolving line of credit is based on variable rates;
    and

    
    
    

    
    
we may be subject
    to covenants that could restrict our operations.


Our
ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations depends on our ability to generate cash in the future.
Our future operating performance is subject to market conditions and business factors that are beyond our control. If we are unable
to make payments on our debt
 we may have to reduce or delay capital expenditures
 sell assets
 seek additional capital or restructure
or refinance our debt.

Our
credit facility contains covenants that place annual restrictions on our operations
 including covenants relating to debt restrictions
capital expenditures
 minimum deposit restrictions
 tangible net worth
 net profit
 leverage
 employee loan restrictions
 distribution
restrictions (common stock and preferred stock)
 dividend restrictions and restrictions on intercompany transactions. The credit
facility also requires that we maintain a minimum working capital at all times. There can be no assurance that we will be in compliance
with all covenants in the future or that we will be able to modify the terms of the credit facility should that become necessary.
Failure to comply with any of these covenants and restrictions would result in an event of default under the loan agreement.

Any
inability to renew
 extend or replace our credit facility on terms favorable to us
 or at all
 could adversely impact our liquidity
 The maturity date of our credit facility is March 31
 2020 and if our credit facility
is not renewed or extended by that date
 all principal and interest will be due and payable. There can be no guarantee that we
will be able to renew
 extend or replace our credit facility upon its maturity date on terms that are favorable to us
 if at all.
Our ability to renew our credit facility
 or to obtain replacement financing at or before the credit facility&rsquo;s expiration
date
 will be constrained by then-current economic conditions affecting the credit markets. Any inability to renew
 extend or
replace our credit facility by its maturity date
 could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to fund our
business.

If
we fail to promote
 enhance and maintain our brands
 the value of our brands could decrease and our revenues and profitability
 We believe that promoting and enhancing our brands is critical to our success. If our brand-building
strategy is unsuccessful
 these expenses may never be recovered
 and we may be unable to increase awareness of our brands or protect
the value of our brands. If we are unable to achieve these goals
 our revenues and ability to implement our business strategy
could be adversely affected.

Our
success in promoting and enhancing our brands will also depend on our ability to provide customers with high quality products
and service. Although we take measures to ensure that we sell only fresh roasted coffee
 we have no control over our roasted coffee
products once they are purchased by our customers. Accordingly
 wholesale customers may store our coffee for longer periods of
time or resell our coffee without our consent
 in each case
 potentially affecting the quality of the coffee prepared from our
products. Although we believe we are less susceptible to quality control problems than many of our competitors because our products
are processed in-house under strict quality control guidelines which have been in place for more than 40 years
 if consumers do
not perceive our products and service to be of high quality
 then the value of our brands may be diminished and
 consequently
our operating results and ability to implement our business strategy may be adversely affected.


    
    


Our
roasting methods are not proprietary
 so competitors may be able to duplicate them
 which could harm our competitive position.
If our competitive position is weakened
 We consider
our roasting methods essential to the flavor and richness of our roasted coffee and
 therefore
 essential to our brands of coffee.
Because we do not hold any patents for our roasting methods
 it may be difficult for us to prevent competitors from copying our
roasting methods if such methods become known. If our competitors copy our roasting methods
 the value of our coffee brands may
be diminished
 and we may lose customers to our competitors. In addition
 competitors may be able to develop roasting methods
that are more advanced than our roasting methods
 which may also harm our competitive position.

The
success of our brand also depends in part on our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of trademarks
 copyrights
 service
marks
 trade secrets and similar rights to protect our intellectual property. The success of our growth strategy depends on our
continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our
brand in both domestic and international markets. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate
 or if
any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property
 the value of our brand may be harmed
 which could have
a material adverse effect on our business. We may become engaged in litigation to protect our intellectual property
 which could
result in substantial costs to us as well as diversion of management attention.

Since
we rely heavily on common carriers to ship our coffee on a daily basis
 any disruption in their services or increase in shipping
costs could adversely affect our relationship with our customers
 which could result in reduced revenues
 increased operating
expenses
 We rely on a number of common carriers to deliver coffee to our
customers and to deliver coffee beans to us. We have no control over these common carriers and the services provided by them may
be interrupted as a result of labor shortages
 contract disputes and other factors. If we experience an interruption in these
services
 we may be unable to ship our coffee in a timely manner
 which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our relationship
with our customers. In addition
 a delay in shipping could require us to contract with alternative
 and possibly more expensive
common carriers and could cause orders to be cancelled or receipt of goods to be refused. Any significant increase in shipping
costs could lower our profit margins or force us to raise prices
 which could cause our revenue and profits to suffer.

If
there was a significant interruption in the operation of our Colorado
 Ohio or Massachusetts facilities
 we may not have the capacity
to service all of our customers and we may not be able to service our customers in a timely manner
 thereby reducing our revenues
 We are dependent on the continued operations of our Colorado
 Ohio and Massachusetts coffee roasting and
distribution facilities. Our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications equipment in effective working order and
to protect against damage from fire
 natural disaster
 power loss
 telecommunications failure or similar events. In addition
growth of our customer base may strain or exceed the capacity of our systems and lead to degradations in performance or systems
failure. Although we continually review and consider upgrades to our order fulfillment infrastructure and provide for system redundancies
to limit the likelihood of systems overload or failure
 substantial damage to our systems or a systems failure that causes interruptions
for a number of days could adversely affect our business. Additionally
 if we are unsuccessful in updating and expanding our order
fulfillment infrastructure
 our ability to grow may be constrained. As a result
 our revenues and earnings could be materially
adversely affected.

Risks
related to the coffee industry

Increases
 Green coffee is
our largest single cost of sales. Coffee is a traded commodity and
 in general
 its price can fluctuate depending on:



    
    
outside speculative
    influences such as indexed and algorithmic commodity funds;

    
    
    

    
    
weather patterns
    in coffee-producing countries;

    
    
    

    
    
economic and political
    conditions affecting coffee-producing countries
 including acts of terrorism in such countries;

    
    
    

    
    
foreign currency
    fluctuations; and

    
    
    

    
    
trade regulations
    and restrictions between coffee-producing countries and the United States.



    
    


If
the cost of wholesale green coffee increases due to any of these factors
 our margins could decrease and our profitability could
suffer accordingly. It is expected that coffee prices will remain volatile in the coming years. Although we have historically
attempted to raise the selling prices of our products in response to increases in the price of wholesale green coffee
 when wholesale
green coffee prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than normal levels
 we are not always able to pass the price increases
through to our customers on a timely basis
 if at all
 which adversely affects our operating margins and cash flow. We may not
be able to recover any future increases in the cost of wholesale green coffee. Even if we are able to recover future increases
our operating margins and results of operations may still be materially and adversely affected by time delays in the implementation
of price increases.

Disruptions
in the supply of green coffee could result in a deterioration of our relationship with our customers
 decreased revenues or could
 Green coffee is a commodity and its supply is subject to volatility beyond our
control. Supply is affected by many factors in the coffee growing countries including weather
 pest damage
 economic conditions
acts of terrorism
 as well as efforts by coffee growers to expand or form cartels or associations. In addition
 the political
situation in many of the Arabica coffee growing regions
 including Africa
 Indonesia
 and Central and South America
 can be unstable
and such instability could affect our ability to purchase coffee from those regions. If Arabica coffee beans from a region become
unavailable or prohibitively expensive
 we could be forced to discontinue particular coffee types and blends or substitute coffee
beans from other regions in our blends. Frequent substitutions and changes in our coffee product lines could lead to cost increases
customer alienation and fluctuations in our gross margins.

Some
of the Arabica coffee beans of the quality we purchase do not trade directly on the commodity markets. Rather
 we purchase the
high-end Arabica coffee beans that we use on a negotiated basis. We depend on our relationships with coffee brokers
 exporters
and growers for the supply of our primary raw material
 high quality Arabica coffee beans. If any of our relationships with coffee
brokers
 exporters or growers deteriorate
 we may be unable to procure a sufficient quantity of high quality coffee beans at prices
acceptable to us or at all. In such case
 we may not be able to fulfill the demand of our existing customers
 supply new retail
stores or expand other channels of distribution. A raw material shortage could result in a deterioration of our relationship with
our customers
 decreased revenues or could impair our ability to expand our business.

The
coffee industry is highly competitive and if we cannot compete successfully
 we may lose our customers or experience reduced sales
 The coffee markets in which we do business are highly competitive and competition in these markets
could become increasingly more intense due to the increasing popularity and growth of the coffee industry. The industry in which
we compete is particularly sensitive to price pressure
 as well as quality
 reputation and viability for wholesale and brand loyalty
for retail. To the extent that one or more of our competitors becomes more successful with respect to any key competitive factor
our ability to attract and retain customers could be materially adversely affected. Our private label and branded coffee products
compete with other manufacturers of private label coffee and branded coffees. These competitors
 such as Kraft Foods
 Inc. (owner
of the Maxwell House brand)
 J.M. Smucker Co. (owner of the Folgers and Caf&eacute; Bustelo brands)
 and Massimo Zanetti Beverage
Group
 have much greater financial
 marketing
 distribution
 management and other resources than we do for marketing
 promotions
and geographic and market expansion. In addition
 there are a growing number of specialty coffee companies who provide specialty
green coffee and roasted coffee for retail sale. If we are unable to compete successfully against existing and new competitors
we may lose our customers or experience reduced sales and profitability.

Besides
coffee
 we face exposure to other commodity cost fluctuations
In addition to the
increase in coffee costs discussed in the risk factor above
 we are exposed to cost fluctuation in other commodities
 including
in particular
 steel
 natural gas and gasoline. In addition
 an increase in the cost of fuel could indirectly lead to higher electricity
costs
 transportation costs and other commodity costs. Much like coffee costs
 the costs of these commodities depend on various
factors beyond our control
 including economic and political conditions
 foreign currency fluctuations
 and global weather patterns.
To the extent we are unable to pass along such costs to our customers through price increases
 our margins and profitability will
decrease.

Adverse
Coffee contains caffeine and other active compounds
 the
health effects of some of which are not fully understood. A number of research studies conclude or suggest that excessive consumption
of caffeine may lead to increased heart rate
 nausea and vomiting
 restlessness and anxiety
 depression
 headaches
 tremors
 sleeplessness
and other adverse health effects. An unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in coffee
could significantly reduce the demand for coffee
 which could harm our business and reduce our sales and profits. In addition
we could become subject to litigation relating to the existence of such compounds in our coffee; litigation that could be costly
and could divert management attention.


    
    


Risks
related to our common stock

Our
operating results may fluctuate significantly
 which makes our results of operations difficult to predict and could cause our
 Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year
to year as a result of a number of factors
 many of which are outside of our control. These fluctuations could be caused by a
number of factors including:



    
    
fluctuations in
    purchase prices and supply of green coffee;

    
    
    

    
    
fluctuations in
    the selling prices of our products;

    
    
    

    
    
the level of marketing
    and pricing competition from existing or new competitors in the coffee industry;

    
    
    

    
    
the success of our
    hedging strategy;

    
    
    

    
    
our ability to retain
    existing customers and attract new customers; and

    
    
    

    
    
our ability to manage
    inventory and fulfillment operations and maintain gross margins.


As
a result of the foregoing
 period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and those comparisons
should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Accordingly
 our operating results in future quarters may be below
market expectations. In this event
 the price of our common stock may decline.

The
Members of the Gordon family
 including
Andrew Gordon
 our President
 Chief Executive Officer
 Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
 and David Gordon
 our Executive
Vice President and Secretary
 own
 in the aggregate
 approximately 15.6% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result
the Gordon family is able to influence the actions that require stockholder approval
 including:



    
    
the election of
    a majority of our directors;

    
    
    

    
    
the amendment of
    our charter documents; and

    
    
    

    
    
the approval of
    mergers
 sales of assets or other corporate transactions or matters submitted for stockholder approval.


As
a result
 our other stockholders may have reduced influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval. In addition
 the
Gordon family&rsquo;s influence could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of us and consequently materially adversely affect
the price of our common stock.

The
 The market price and
trading volume of our common stock has been volatile over the past year and it may continue to be volatile. Over the past year
our common stock has traded as low as $3.53 and as high as $7.79 per share. We cannot predict the price at which our common stock
will trade in the future and it may decline. The price at which our common stock trades may fluctuate significantly and may be
influenced by many factors
 including our financial results
 developments generally affecting the coffee industry
 general economic
industry and market conditions
 the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock
 fluctuations in coffee prices
 investor
perceptions of our business
 reports by industry analysts
 negative announcements by our customers
 competitors or suppliers regarding
their own performances
 and the impact of other &ldquo;Risk Factors&rdquo; discussed in this Annual Report.


    
    


Provisions
in our articles of incorporation
 bylaws and of Nevada law have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control that
could be beneficial to our stockholders
Our articles
of incorporation
 bylaws and Nevada corporate law contain provisions that could delay
 defer or prevent a change in control of
us or our management that could be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make
it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions might also discourage
a potential acquisition proposal or tender offer
 even if the acquisition proposal or tender offer is at a price above the then
current market price for shares of our common stock. These provisions:



    
    
provide that directors
    may only be removed upon a vote of at least eighty percent of the shares outstanding;

    
    
    

    
    
establish advance
    notice requirements for nominating directors and proposing matters to be voted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings;

    
    
    

    
    
limit the right
    of our stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;

    
    
    

    
    
authorize our board
    of directors to issue preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of those shares
 which would be senior to
    our common stock
 without prior stockholder approval;

    
    
    

    
    
require amendments
    to our articles of incorporation to be approved by the holders of at least eighty percent of our outstanding shares of common
    stock;

    
    
    

    
    
a classified board
    of directors with three-year staggered terms
 which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority
    of our board of directors; and

    
    
    

    
    
provide a prohibition
    on stockholder action by written consent
 thereby only permitting stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting
    of our stockholders.


We
are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under Nevada law. Under Nevada law
 a corporation may not
 in general
 engage
in a business combination with any &ldquo;interested stockholder&rdquo; for two (2) years after the date the person first became
an interested stockholder
 unless the combination meets all of the requirements of our articles of incorporation and (i) the purchase
of shares by the interested stockholder is approved by our board of directors before that date or (ii) the combination is approved
by our board of directors and
 at or after that time
 the combination is approved at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders
and not by written consent
 by the affirmative vote of the holders of stock representing at least sixty percent (60%) of our outstanding
voting power not beneficially owned by the interested stockholder or the affiliates or associates of the interested stockholder.

MANAGEMENT&rsquo;S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Cautionary
Note on Forward-Looking Statements

Some
of the matters discussed under the caption &ldquo;Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operation
&rdquo; &ldquo;Business
&rdquo; &ldquo;Risk Factors&rdquo; and elsewhere in this annual report include forward-looking
statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We have based
these forward-looking statements upon information available to management as of the date of this Form 10-K and management&rsquo;s
expectations and projections about future events
 including
 among other things:



    
    
our dependency on
    a single commodity could affect our revenues and profitability;

    
    
our success in expanding
    our market presence in new geographic regions;

    
    
the effectiveness
    of our hedging policy may impact our profitability;

    
    
the success of our
    joint ventures;

    
    
our success in implementing
    our business strategy or introducing new products;

    
    
our ability to attract
    and retain customers;

    
    
our ability to obtain
    additional financing;

    
    
our ability to comply
    with the restrictive covenants we are subject to under our current financing;

    
    
the effects of competition
    from other coffee manufacturers and other beverage alternatives;

    
    
the impact to the
    operations of our Colorado facility;

    
    
general economic
    conditions and conditions which affect the market for coffee;

    
    
the macro global
    economic environment;

    
    
our ability to maintain
    and develop our brand recognition;

    
    
the impact of rapid
    or persistent fluctuations in the price of coffee beans;

    
    
fluctuations in
    the supply of coffee beans;

    
    
the volatility of
    our common stock; and

    
    
other risks which
    we identify in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;SEC&rdquo;).


In
some cases
 you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as &ldquo;may
&rdquo; &ldquo;should
&rdquo; &ldquo;could
&rdquo;
&ldquo;predict
&rdquo; &ldquo;potential
&rdquo; &ldquo;continue
&rdquo; &ldquo;expect
&rdquo; &ldquo;anticipate
&rdquo; &ldquo;future
&rdquo;
&ldquo;intend
&rdquo; &ldquo;plan
&rdquo; &ldquo;believe
&rdquo; &ldquo;estimate&rdquo; and similar expressions (or the negative
of such expressions). Any or all of our forward looking statements in this annual report and in any other public statements we
make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.
Consequently
 no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. In addition
 we undertake no responsibility to update any forward-looking
statement to reflect events or circumstances
 that occur after the date of this annual report.


    
    




We
are an integrated wholesale coffee roaster and dealer in the United States and one of the few coffee companies that offers a broad
array of coffee products across the entire spectrum of consumer tastes
 preferences and price points. As a result
 we believe
that we are well-positioned to increase our profitability and endure potential coffee price volatility throughout varying cycles
of the coffee market and economic conditions.

Our
operations have primarily focused on the following areas of the coffee industry:



    
    
the sale of wholesale
    specialty green coffee;

    
    
the roasting
 blending
    packaging and sale of private label coffee;

    
    
the roasting
 blending
    packaging and sale of our eight brands of coffee; and

    
    
sales of our tabletop
    coffee roasting equipment.


Our
operating results are affected by a number of factors including:



    
    
the level of marketing
    and pricing competition from existing or new competitors in the coffee industry;

    
    
our ability to retain
    existing customers and attract new customers;

    
    
    

    
    
fluctuations in
    purchase prices and supply of green coffee and in the selling prices of our products; and

    
    
our ability to manage
    inventory and fulfillment operations and maintain gross margins.


Our
net sales are driven primarily by the success of our sales and marketing efforts and our ability to retain existing customers
and attract new customers. For this reason
 we have made
 and will continue to evaluate
 strategic decisions to invest in measures
that are expected to increase net sales. These transactions include our acquisition of Premier Roasters
 LLC
 including equipment
and a roasting facility in La Junta
 Colorado
 the addition of a west coast sales manager to increase sales of our private label
and branded coffees to new customers
 our joint venture with Caruso&rsquo;s Coffee
 Inc. of Brecksville
 Ohio
 the transaction
with OPTCO. On June 29
 2016
 we purchased substantially all the assets
 including equipment
 inventory
 customer lists and relationships
of Coffee Kinetics
 LLC. A Washington limited liability company. On June 29
 2016
 we purchased through SONO
 substantially all
the assets
 including equipment
 inventory
 customer list and relationships of Coffee Kinetics
 LLC
 a Washington limited liability
company. On February 24
 2017
 we acquired 100% of the capital stock of Comfort Foods
 Inc. (&ldquo;CFI&rdquo;)
 a Massachusetts
based medium sized coffee roaster
 manufacturing both branded and private label coffee for retail and foodservice customers. In
April 2018
 Generations Coffee Company
 the entity formed as a result of our joint venture with Caruso&rsquo;s Coffee
 Inc.
 purchased
substantially all the assets of Steep &amp; Brew
 Inc. We believe these efforts will allow us to expand our business.

Our
net sales are affected by the price of green coffee. We purchase our green coffee from dealers located primarily within the United
States. The dealers supply us with coffee beans from many countries
 including Colombia
 Mexico
 Kenya
 Indonesia
 Brazil and
Uganda. The supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond
our control. For example
 in Brazil
 which produces approximately 40% of the world&rsquo;s green coffee
 the coffee crops are
historically susceptible to frost in June and July and drought in September
 October and November. However
 because we purchase
coffee from a number of countries and are able to freely substitute one country&rsquo;s coffee for another in our products
 price
fluctuations in one country generally have not had a material impact on the price we pay for coffee. Accordingly
 price fluctuations
in one country generally have not had a material effect on our results of operations
 liquidity and capital resources. Historically
because we generally have been able to pass green coffee price increases through to customers
 increased prices of green coffee
generally result in increased net sales
 irrespective of sales volume.

The
supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control.
Historically
 we have used
 and intend to continue to use in a limited capacity
 short-term coffee futures and options contracts
primarily for the purpose of partially hedging the effects of changing green coffee prices
 as further explained in Note 2 of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report. In addition
 we acquired
 and expect to continue to acquire
futures contracts with longer terms
 generally three to four months
 primarily for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply
of green coffee. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on options and futures contracts are reflected in our cost of sales.
Gains on options and futures contracts reduce our cost of sales and losses on options and futures contracts increase our cost
of sales. The use of these derivative financial instruments has generally enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices.
We believe that
 in normal economic times
 our hedging policies remain a vital element to our business model not only in controlling
our cost of sales
 but also giving us the flexibility to obtain the inventory necessary to continue to grow our sales while trying
to minimize margin compression during a time of historically high coffee prices. However
 no strategy can entirely eliminate pricing
risks and we generally remain exposed to losses on futures contracts when prices decline significantly in a short period of time
and we would generally remain exposed to supply risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to any of our futures
contracts. Although we have had net gains on options and futures contracts in the past
 we have incurred significant losses on
options and futures contracts during some recent reporting periods. In these cases
 our cost of sales has increased
 resulting
in a decrease in our profitability or increase our losses. Such losses have and could in the future materially increase our cost
of sales and materially decrease our profitability and adversely affect our stock price. See &ldquo;Item 1A &ndash; Risk Factors
- If our hedging policy is not effective
 we may not be able to control our coffee costs
 we may be forced to pay greater than
market value for green coffee and our profitability may be reduced.&rdquo; Failure to properly design and implement an effective
hedging strategy may materially adversely affect our business and operating results. If the hedges that we enter do not adequately
offset the risks of coffee bean price volatility or our hedges result in losses
 our cost of sales may increase
 resulting in
a decrease in profitability or increased losses. As previously announced
 as a result of the volatile nature of the commodities
markets
 we have and are continuing to scale back our use of hedging and short-term trading of coffee futures and options contracts
and intend to continue to use these practices in a limited capacity going forward.


    
    


Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (&ldquo;U.S. GAAP&rdquo;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for
 but not limited to
 the accounting for the
allowance for doubtful accounts
 inventories
 assets held for sale
 business combinations
 carrying amounts of intangible assets
and goodwill
 deferred taxes
 income taxes
 commodities held and loss contingencies. Management bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We
believe the following critical accounting policies
 among others
 may be impacted significantly by judgment
 assumptions and estimates
used in the preparation of the financial statements:



    
    
The Company recognizes
    revenue in accordance with the five-step model as prescribed by ASU 606 in which the Company evaluates the transfer of promised
    goods or services and recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that
    reflects the consideration which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To
    determine revenue recognition for the arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASU 606
 the Company
    performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer
 (2) identify the performance obligations
    in the contract
 (3) determine the transaction price
 (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in
    the contract and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. See Note 11 for revenue
    disaggregated by product line.

    
    
    

    
    
Our allowance for
    doubtful accounts is maintained to provide for losses arising from customers&rsquo; inability to make required payments. If
    there is deterioration of our customers&rsquo; credit worthiness and/or there is an increase in the length of time that the
    receivables are past due greater than the historical assumptions used
 additional allowances may be required. For example
    every additional one percent of our accounts receivable that becomes uncollectible
 would decrease our operating income by
    approximately $94
000 for the year ended October 31
 2019. The reserve for sales discounts represents the estimated discount
    that customers will take upon payment. The reserve for other allowances represents the estimated amount of returns
 slotting
    fees and volume based discounts estimated to be incurred by us from our customers.

    
    
    

    
    
Inventories are
    stated at lower of cost (determined on a first-in
 first-out basis) or market. Based on our assumptions about future demand
    and market conditions
 inventories are subject to be written-down to market value. If our assumptions about future demand
    change and/or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected
 additional write-downs of inventories may
    be required. Each additional one percent of potential inventory write-down would have decreased operating income by approximately
    $188
000 for the year ended October 31
 2019.

    
    
    

    
    
The commodities
    held at broker represent the market value of the Company&rsquo;s trading account
 which consists of option and futures contracts
    for coffee held with a brokerage firm. We use options and futures contracts
 which are not designated or qualifying as hedging
    instruments
 to partially hedge the effects of fluctuations in the price of green coffee beans. Options and futures contracts
    are recognized at fair value in the consolidated financial statements with current recognition of gains and losses on such
    positions. We classify options and futures contracts as trading securities and accordingly
 unrealized holding gains and losses
    are included in earnings. We record realized and unrealized gains and losses in our cost of sales in the statement of operations/income.

    
    
    

    
    
We account for income
    taxes in accordance with the relevant authoritative guidance. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed for temporary
    differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible
    amounts in the future based on enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
    Deferred tax assets are reflected on the balance sheet when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset
    will be realized.



    
    




    
    
Our goodwill consists
    of the cost in excess of the fair market value of the acquired net assets of OPTCO
 SONO
 CFI and Steep &amp; Brew
 through
    GCC
 which has been integrated into a structure that does not provide the basis for separate reporting units. Consequently
    we are a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes. We also have intangible assets consisting of our
    customer lists and relationships and trademarks acquired from OPTCO and SONO. At October 31
 2019 our balance sheet reflected
    goodwill and intangible assets as set forth below:

Goodwill
and the trademarks which are deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests. Goodwill impairment tests
require the comparison of the fair value and carrying value of reporting units. We assess the potential impairment of goodwill
and intangible assets annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable. Upon completion of such review
 if impairment is found to have occurred
 a corresponding charge
will be recorded. The value assigned to the customer list and relationships is being amortized over a twenty year period.

Because
the Company is a single reporting unit
 the closing NASDAQ Capital Market price of our common stock as of the acquisition date
was used as a basis to measure the fair value of goodwill. Goodwill and the intangible assets will be tested annually at the end
of each fiscal year to determine whether they have been impaired. Upon completion of each annual review
 there can be no assurance
that a material charge will not be recorded. Impairment testing is required more often than annually if an event or circumstance
indicates that an impairment or decline in value may have occurred.

Year
Ended October 31
 2019 (Fiscal Year 2019) Compared to the Year Ended October 31
 2018 (Fiscal Year 2018)

Net
 Net sales totaled $86
467
432 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2019
 a decrease of $4
187
862
 or 4.6%
 from
$90
655
294 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2018. The decrease in net sales reflects the lower selling price of coffee during
the year due to the continued depressed price of the green coffee market.

Cost
 Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2019 was $70
708
100
 or 81.8% of net sales
 as compared
to $75
040
802
 or 82.8% of net sales
 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2018. Cost of sales consists primarily of the cost
of green coffee and packaging materials and realized and unrealized gains or losses on hedging activity. The decrease in cost
of sales was due to our decreased sales.

Gross
 Gross profit for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2019 was $15
759
332
 an increase of $144
840 from $15
614
492
for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2018. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 18.2% for the fiscal year ended
October 31
 2019 from 17.2% for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2018. The increase in gross profits resulted from a reduction
in coffee prices.


    
    


Operating
 Total operating expenses increased by $2
005
474 to $15
218
803 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2019 from
$13
213
329 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2018. Selling and administrative expenses increased $1
972
378
 or 15.7%
 to
$14
504
707 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2019 from $12
532
329 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2018. The primary
reasons for this increase was the reflection of a full year of Steep &amp; Brew for fiscal year ended October 31
 2019 as compared
to a half year for fiscal year ended October 31
 2018 which accounted for $1
836
803 and the increase in our freight costs
as we increased and expanded our product distribution partially offset by our continued efforts to reduce overhead. Officers&rsquo;
salary increased by $33
096 or 4.9% to $714
096 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2019 from $681

 2019 was $247
315
 a decrease of $114
910 from $362
225
for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2018. The decrease in other expense was attributable to a decrease in interest expense of
$116
113
 a decrease in interest income of $2
301 and a decrease in our loss from our equity investments of $1
098
 during the
fiscal year ended October 31
 2019.

Income
 We had income of $293
214 before
income taxes and non-controlling interest in subsidiary for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2019 compared to income of $2
038
938
for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2018
 resulting in a net change of $1
745
724 for the year ended October 31
 2019. The decrease
was primarily attributable to the reasons described above.

Income
 Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2019 totaled $29
208 compared to a provision
of $511
532 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2018. The change was attributable to the difference in the income for the year
ended October 31
 2019 versus fiscal year ended October 31
 2018.

Net
 We had a net loss of $94
598 or $0.02 per share basic and diluted
 for the fiscal year ended October 31
2019 compared to a net income of $1
059
276
 or $0.19 per share basic and diluted for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2018.
The decrease in net income was due primarily to the reasons described above.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

As
of October 31
 2019
 we had working capital of $20
227
944
 which represented a $656
458 increase from our working capital of
$19
571
486 as of October 31
 2018
 and total stockholders&rsquo; equity of $25
264
077 which increased by $382
301 from our total
stockholders&rsquo; equity of $24
881
776 as of October 31
 2018. Our working capital increased primarily due to increases of
$3
570
119 in inventory
 8
765 in prepaid expenses and other current assets
 $2
728 in prepaid and refundable income taxes
 a
decrease of $489
533 in accounts payable and accrued expenses
 $1
405 in income taxes payable
 a decrease in due to broker of
$123
077
 partially offset by decreases of $2
208
828 in cash
 decreases of $492
870 in accounts receivable
 increases in our
short term borrowing of $837
471. As of October 31
 2019
 the outstanding balance on our line of credit was $7
167
740 compared
to $6
260
014 as of October 31
 2018. Total stockholders&rsquo; equity increased due to our option issuance partially offset by
our net loss.

On
April 25
 2017
 we and OPTCO (collectively referred to herein as the &ldquo;Borrowers&rdquo;) entered into an Amended and Restated
Loan and Security Agreement (the &ldquo;A&amp;R Loan Agreement&rdquo;) with Sterling
 which consolidated the Company Financing
Agreement and the OPTCO Financing Agreement.

Pursuant
to the A&amp;R Loan Agreement
 the terms of each of the Company Financing Agreement and the OPTCO Financing Agreement were amended
and restated to
 among other things: (i) provide for a new Maturity Date of February 28
 2018; (ii) consolidate the principal
amounts of the Company Financing Agreement and the OPTCO Financing Agreement to provide for a maximum principal amount limit of
$12
000
000 for the Borrowers
 collectively
 OPTCO is limited to a $3
000
000 maximum principal amount sublimit;
(iii) expand the borrowing base to include
 along with 85% of eligible accounts receivable
 up to the lesser of $2
000
000 as
to the Company and $1
500
000 as to OPTCO; (iv) effective March 1
 2017
 converted the interest rate on the average unpaid balance
of the A&amp;R Loan Facility from an interest rate per annum equal to the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate to an interest rate per
annum equal to the sum of the LIBOR rate plus 2.4%; (v) require the Company and OPTCO to pay
 collectively
 upon the occurrence
of certain termination events
 a prepayment premium of 1.0% (as opposed to the 0.5% under the OPTCO Financing Agreement) of the
maximum amount of the A&amp;R Loan Facility in effect as of the date of the termination event; (vi) eliminate the over advance
fee; and (vii) establish a Letter of Credit Facility (as defined in the A&amp;R Loan Agreement) with a maximum obligation amount
of $1
000
000
 and subject to other terms and conditions described therein. Also on April 25
 2017
 SONO and CFI (collectively
referred to herein as the &ldquo;Guarantors&rdquo;)
 entered into a Guaranty Agreement (the &ldquo;Guaranty Agreement&rdquo;)
in connection with the A&amp;R Loan Agreement. The Guaranty Agreement was provided as an inducement to Sterling to extend credit
to Borrowers in exchange for the Guarantors&rsquo; unconditional guarantee of the payment and performance obligations of the Borrowers
under the Loan Agreement
 as further defined in the Guaranty Agreement.


    
    


On
March 23
 2018
 we entered into a new loan modification agreement and credit facility with Sterling. The terms of the new agreement
among other things: (i) provides for a new maturity date of March 31
 2020; (ii) increases the maximum principal amount to $14
000
000;
and (iii) decreases the interest rate per annum to LIBOR plus 2 percent.


006 before non controlling interest
in subsidiary and had negative cash flows from operating activities of approximately $2.1 million for the year ended October 31
2019. Our working capital amounted to $20
227
944 at October 31
 2019
 which includes approximately $2
400
000 ($2
700
000 at January
27
 2020) of cash and cash equivalents and an increased level of inventory purchased at reduced prices
 which management believes
is a significant source of near term liquidity. We also have outstanding bank borrowings of $7
167
740 (approximately $5
200
000
at January 27
 2020) under a line of credit that matures on March 31
 2010. We are currently engaged in discussions with several
lenders to either renew or extend the line of credit prior to its expiration; however
 no agreement has yet been reached to extend
or renew the facility at this time. Management believes that we have substantial excess working capital and the ability to manage
expenditures in the near-term to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity available to repay the loan at its stated maturity date
in the event of non-renewal. This plan could include deferring certain discretionary spending
 extending the payment dates of certain
trade liabilities that we have traditionally paid in thirty days or less and taking advantage of the availability of inventory
that was sourced at favorable prices. We further believe that should the loan be repaid in the event of a non-renewal
 there is
substantial liquidity available to fund operations through the remainder of the twelve month period following the issuance date
of the financial statements.

There
can be no guarantee that we will be able to renew
 extend or replace our credit facility with Sterling upon its maturity date
on terms that are favorable to us
 if at all. Our ability to renew our credit facility
 or to obtain replacement financing at
or before the credit facility&rsquo;s expiration date
 will be constrained by then-current economic conditions affecting the credit
markets. Any inability to renew
 extend or replace our credit facility by its maturity date
 could have a material adverse effect
on our liquidity and ability to fund our business.

Each
of the A&amp;R Loan Facility and A&amp;R Loan Agreement contains covenants
 subject to certain exceptions
 that place annual restrictions
on the Borrowers&rsquo; operations
 including covenants relating to debt restrictions
 capital expenditures
 indebtedness
 minimum
deposit restrictions
 tangible net worth
 net profit
 leverage
 employee loan restrictions
 dividend and repurchase restrictions
(common stock and preferred stock)
 and restrictions on intercompany transactions.

The
A&amp;R Loan Facility also requires that we maintain a minimum working capital at all times
 and the A&amp;R Loan Agreement requires
that the Borrowers
 on a consolidated basis
 maintain a minimum working capital at all times and achieve a minimum net profit
amount as of fiscal year end during the term of the A&amp;R Loan Agreement.

Each
of the A&amp;R Loan Facility and the A&amp;R Loan Agreement is secured by all tangible and intangible assets of the Company. Other
than as amended and restated by the A&amp;R Loan Agreement
 the Company Financing Agreement and the OPTCO Financing Agreement
remains in full force and effect.

As
of October 31
 2019 and October 31
 2018
 the outstanding balance under the bank line of credit was $7
167
740 and $6
260
014
respectively.

For
the fiscal year ended October 31
 2019
 our operating activities used net cash of $2
302
889 as compared to the fiscal year ended
October 31
 2018 when operating activities provided net cash of $8
693
403. The decreased cash flow from operations for the fiscal
year ended October 31
 2019 was primarily due to our net income
 accounts receivable
 inventories and accounts payable and accrued
expenses.

For
the fiscal year ended October 31
 2019
 our investing activities used net cash of $743
410 as compared to the fiscal year ended
October 31
 2018 when net cash used by investing activities was $3
060
851. The decrease in our uses of cash in investing activities
was due to our decreased outlays for business purchases
 partially offset by our increased purchases of machinery and equipment
during the fiscal year ended October 31
 2019.

For
the fiscal year ended October 31
 2019
 our financing activities provided net cash of $837
471 compared to net cash used in financing
activities of $3
346
818 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2018. The change in cash flow from financing activities for the
fiscal year ended October 31
 2019 was due to our decreased purchases of treasury stock and our decreased principal reductions
on our line of credit.

We
expect to fund our operations
 including paying our liabilities
 funding capital expenditures and making required payments on
our indebtedness
 through October 31
 2020 with cash provided by operating activities and the use of our credit facility. In addition
an increase in eligible accounts receivable and inventory would permit us to make additional borrowings under our line of credit.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition
 changes in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures or capital
resources that is material to investors.

ITEM
    9A.
CONTROLS AND
    PROCEDURES


Evaluation
 Management
 which includes our President
 Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer
 has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;)) as of the end of the period covered by this
report. Based upon that evaluation
 our President
 Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective and we have a material weakness related to the accounting for stock-based compensation
awards. Despite the existence of the material weakness
 we believe the financial information presented herein is materially correct
and fairly presents the financial position and operating results of the fiscal year ended October 31
 2019 in accordance with
U.S. GAAP.

Management
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

Our
internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in
reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets
 provide reasonable assurances that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP
 and that receipts and expenditures
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and the directors
 and provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect
on our financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of October 31
 2019. In making this
assessment
 management used the criteria set forth by the 2013 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based upon the assessment
 our management concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was not effective as of October 31
 2019 and we have a material weakness related to the accounting for stock-based compensation
awards. A material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control
 such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of the entity&rsquo;s financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected
on a timely basis.

Remediation
Plan for the Material Weakness

To
remediate the material weakness identified above
 we are initiating controls and procedures in order to:


Reinforce
                                         the importance of a strong control environment
 to emphasize the technical requirements
                                         for controls that are designed
 implemented and operating effectively and to set the
                                         appropriate expectations on internal controls through establishing the related policies
                                         and procedures; and


Review
                                         the processes for documenting and alerting key personnel
 including our board members
                                         officers
 auditors and outside accountants
 of non-reoccurring events related to stock-based
                                         compensation awards to ensure such events are timely and adequately recorded and communicated
                                         to the appropriate parties.

The
material weakness identified above will not be considered remediated until our remediation efforts have been fully implemented
and we have concluded that these controls are operating effectively.

Management
does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control
system
 no matter how well conceived and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance that the objectives of
the control systems are met. Further
 the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective
control system
 no evaluation of internal control over financial reporting can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due
to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
 have been or will be detected.

Changes
 During the fiscal year ending October 31
 2019
 we continued to implement procedures
to review and document all corporate actions related to stock-based compensation awards. There have been no additional changes
in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during our last fiscal
quarter that has materially affected
 or that is reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

Attestation
Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
financial reporting. Management&rsquo;s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant
to section 989G of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that permits us to provide only management&rsquo;s
report in this annual report.

COFFEE
HOLDING CO.
 INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OCTOBER

 2019 AND 2018

NOTE
1 - BUSINESS ACTIVITIES:

Coffee
Holding Co.
 Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) conducts wholesale coffee operations
 including manufacturing
 roasting
 packaging
marketing and distributing roasted and blended coffees for private labeled accounts and its own brands
 and it sells green coffee.
The Company&rsquo;s core product
 coffee
 can be summarized and divided into three product categories (&ldquo;product lines&rdquo;)
as follows:

Wholesale
 unroasted raw beans imported from around the world and sold to large and small roasters and coffee shop
operators;

Private
 coffee roasted
 blended
 packaged and sold under the specifications and names of others
 including supermarkets
that want to have their own brand name on coffee to compete with national brands; and

Branded
 coffee roasted and blended to the Company&rsquo;s own specifications and packaged and sold under the Company&rsquo;s
eight proprietary and licensed brand names in different segments of the market.

The
Company&rsquo;s private label and branded coffee sales are primarily to customers that are located throughout the United States
with limited sales in Canada and certain countries in Asia. Such customers include supermarkets
 wholesalers
 and individually-owned
and multi-unit retailers. The Company&rsquo;s unprocessed green coffee
 which includes over 90 specialty coffee offerings
 is
sold primarily to specialty gourmet roasters and to coffee shop operators in the United States with limited sales in Australia
Canada
 England and China.

The
Company&rsquo;s wholesale green
 private label
 and branded coffee product categories generate revenues and cost of sales individually
but incur selling
 general and administrative expenses in the aggregate. There are no individual product managers and discrete
financial information is not available for any of the product lines. The Company&rsquo;s product portfolio is used in one business
and it operates and competes in one business activity and economic environment. In addition
 the three product lines share customers
manufacturing resources
 sales channels
 and marketing support. Thus
 the Company considers the three product lines to be one
single reporting segment.

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:


LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION:


of $264
006 before non controlling interest in subsidiary and had negative cash flows from operating activities of approximately
$2.1 million for the year ended October 31
 2019. The Company&rsquo;s working capital amounted to $20
227
944 at October 31
 2019
which includes approximately $2
400
000 ($2
700
000 at January 27
 2020) of cash and cash equivalents and an increased level of
inventory purchased at reduced prices
 which management believes is a significant source of near term liquidity. The Company also
has outstanding bank borrowings of $7
167
740 (approximately $5
200
000 at January 27
 2020) under a line of credit that matures
on March 31
 2010. The Company is currently engaged in discussions with several lenders to either renew or extend the line of
credit prior to its expiration; however
 no agreement has yet been reached to extend or renew the facility at this time. Management
believes that the Company has substantial excess working capital and the ability to manage expenditures in the near-term to ensure
that there is sufficient liquidity available to repay the loan at its stated maturity date in the event of non-renewal. This plan
could include deferring certain discretionary spending
 extending the payment dates of certain trade liabilities that the Company
has traditionally paid in thirty days or less and taking advantage of the availability of inventory that was sourced at favorable
prices. The Company further believes that should the loan be repaid in the event of a non-renewal
 there is substantial liquidity
available to fund operations through the remainder of the twelve month period following the issuance date of the financial statements.


BASIS
OF PRESENTATION:

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
 Organic Products Trading Company
 LLC (&ldquo;OPTCO&rdquo;)
Sonofresco LLC (&ldquo;SONO&rdquo;)
 Comfort Foods
 Inc. (&ldquo;CFI&rdquo;) and Generations Coffee Company
 LLC (&ldquo;GCC&rdquo;).
All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

USE
OF ESTIMATES:

The
preparation of the Company&rsquo;s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures.
Significant estimates include allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable and reserves
 inventory obsolescence
 depreciation
intangible asset valuations and useful lives
 taxes
 contingencies
 and valuation of financial instruments. These estimates may
be adjusted as more current information becomes available
 and any adjustment could have a significant impact on recorded amounts.



Cash
consists primarily of unrestricted cash on deposit at financial institutions and brokerage firms.

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont&rsquo;d):

ACCOUNTS
RECEIVABLE:

Trade
accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts
for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Management considers the following
factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts: customer credit-worthiness
 past transaction history
with the customer
 current economic industry trends
 and changes in customer payment terms. Past due balances over 60 days and
other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectability. If the financial condition of the Company&rsquo;s customers
were to deteriorate
 adversely affecting their ability to make payments
 additional allowances would be required. Based on management&rsquo;s
assessment
 the Company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation
allowance. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a
charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable.

The
reserve for sales discounts represents the estimated discount that customers will take upon payment. The reserve for other allowances
represents the estimated amount of returns
 slotting fees and volume based discounts estimated to be incurred by the Company from
its customers. The allowances are summarized as follows:

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost (first in
 first out basis) or net realizable value
 including provisions for obsolescence commensurate
with known or estimated exposures. There are no reserves for obsolescence as of October 31
 2019 and 2018.

MACHINERY
AND EQUIPMENT:

Machinery
and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Purchases of machinery and equipment and additions and betterments which substantially extend the useful life of an asset are
capitalized at cost. Expenditures which do not materially prolong the normal useful life of an asset are charged to operations
as incurred. The Company also provides for amortization of leasehold improvements.

COMMODITIES
HELD BY BROKER:

The
commodities held at broker represent the market value of the Company&rsquo;s trading account
 which consists of option and future
contracts for coffee held with a brokerage firm. The Company uses options and futures contracts
 which are not designated or qualifying
as hedging instruments
 to partially hedge the effects of fluctuations in the price of green coffee beans. Options and futures
contracts are recognized at fair value in the consolidated financial statements with current recognition of gains and losses on
such positions. The Company&rsquo;s accounting for options and futures contracts may increase earnings volatility in any particular
period.

The
Company has open position contracts held by the broker
 which are summarized as follows:

2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont&rsquo;d):

GOODWILL
AND TRADEMARKS:

The
Company has determined that its goodwill and trademarks
 which consist of product lines
 trade names and packaging designs have
an indefinite useful life. The value of the goodwill and trademarks was allocated based on an independent valuation. Goodwill
and trademarks are not amortized but are assigned to a specific reporting unit or asset class and tested for impairment at least
annually or upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that the reporting unit&rsquo;s carrying amount of
goodwill and trademarks is greater than its fair value. As of October 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company has determined by using a
qualitative assessment that an impairment did not exist. In 2011
 the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard ASB ASU 2011-08
Intangibles &ndash; Goodwill and Other &ndash; Testing Goodwill for Impairment
 which allows an entity to first assess qualitative
factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under this amendment
an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines
 based on a qualitative
assessment
 that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The amendment includes a number
of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment.

list and relationships consist of a specific customer lists and customer contracts obtained by the Company in the acquisition
of OPTCO
 Comfort Foods
 Sonofresco and Steep &amp; Brew which are being amortized on the straight-line method over their estimated
useful life of twenty years.



The
Company expenses the cost of advertising and promotion as incurred. Advertising costs charged to operations totaled $449
678 and
$366
665 for the years ended October 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.

INCOME
TAXES:

The
Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method which requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities
to be computed for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result
in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences
are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amount expected to be realized. The income tax provision or benefit is the tax incurred for the period plus or minus the change
during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.

EARNINGS
PER SHARE:

Basic
earnings per common share were computed by dividing net income by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
plus the dilutive effect of common shares issuable upon exercise of potential sources of dilution. The company has issued 689
000
options as of October 31
 2019
 they have not been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because of their
anti-dilutitive value

The
weighted average common shares outstanding used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share were 5
569
349 and
5
691
057 for the years ended October 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont&rsquo;d):

FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

The
carrying amounts of cash
 accounts receivable
 notes receivable
 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value
because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying amount of the bank line of credit borrowings approximates
fair value because the debt is based on current rates at which the Company could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities.
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time
 based on relevant market information about the financial instruments
when available. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore
cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

REVENUE
RECOGNITION:

The
Company&rsquo;s significant accounting policy for revenue was updated as a result of the adoption of ASU Topic 606. The Company
has adopted the new standard on November 1
 2018 and has used the modified retrospective method. The majority of the Company&rsquo;s
business is ship and bill. Based on our analysis
 the Company did not identify a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings
at November 1
 2018. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the five-step model as prescribed by ASU 606 in which the
Company evaluates the transfer of promised goods or services and recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised
goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange
for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for the arrangements that the Company determines are within the
scope of ASU 606
 the Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer
 (2) identify the
performance obligations in the contract
 (3) determine the transaction price
 (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. See Note 11
for revenue disaggregated by product line.

CONCENTRATION
OF RISK:

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash deposits at financial
institutions and brokerage firms.

at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to certain limits. At October 31
 2019
and 2018
 the Company had approximately $1
490
000 and $2
800
000 in excess of FDIC insured limits
 respectively.

The
accounts at the brokerage firm contain cash and securities. Balances are insured up to $500
000
 with a limit of $100
000 for
cash
 by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). At October 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company had approximately $706

Certain
amounts in the prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year&rsquo;s presentation. These
reclassification adjustments had no effect on the Company&rsquo;s previously reported net income.

EQUITY
METHOD OF ACCOUNTING:

Investee
companies that are not consolidated
 but over which the Company exercises significant influence
 are accounted for under the equity
method of accounting. Whether or not the Company exercises significant influence with respect to an Investee depends on an evaluation
of several factors including
 among others
 representation on the Investee company&rsquo;s board of directors and ownership level
which is generally a 20% to 50% interest in the voting securities of the Investee company. Under the equity method of accounting
an Investee company&rsquo;s accounts are not reflected within the Company&rsquo;s Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated
Statements of Income; however
 the Company&rsquo;s share of the earnings or losses of the Investee company is reflected in the
caption &ldquo;Loss from equity method investments&rdquo; in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company&rsquo;s carrying
value in an equity method Investee company is reflected in the caption &ldquo;Equity method investments&rdquo; in the Company&rsquo;s
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The
Company&rsquo;s investment in a company that is accounted for on the equity method of accounting consist of the following: (1)
20% interest in Healthwise Gourmet Coffees
 LLC
 a distributor of low acidity coffees. The investments in this company amounted
to $100
000. The loss recognized amounted to $3
769 and $4
867 for the years ended October 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively. The
net value of this investment as presented on our consolidated balance sheet at October 31
 2019 and 2018 was $86

respectively.

NOTE
3 - RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AFFECTING THE COMPANY:

The
FASB issued ASU 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-01 requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise
from operating leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the
lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with
a term of 12 months or less
 a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize
lease assets and lease liabilities. In transition
 lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning
of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. Public business entities should apply the amendments
in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years (i.e.
January 1
 2019
 for a calendar year entity). Nonpublic business entities should apply the amendments for fiscal years beginning
after December 15
 2019 (i.e.
 January 1
 2020
 for a calendar year entity)
 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning
after December 15
 2020. Early application is permitted for all public business entities and all nonpublic business entities upon
issuance. The Company adopted Topic 842 effective November 1
 2019 using a modified retrospective method and will not restate
comparative periods. Upon adoption
 the Company recorded a right-to-use asset of $2.5 million and a corresponding lease liability
of approximately $2.7 million on the Company&rsquo;s balance sheet with the difference relating to reclassifications of the deferred
rent liability as a reduction to the right-to-use asset for its operating lease. Adoption of the new lease standard will not have
a significant impact on the Company&rsquo;s statement of operations.

The
FASB issued ASU 2016-09 Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU
2016-09). The amendment simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payments
 including immediate recognition
of all excess tax benefits and deficiencies in the income statement
 changing the threshold to qualify for equity classification
up to the employees&rsquo; maximum statutory tax rates
 allowing an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate
the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur
 and clarifying the classification on
the statement of cash flows for the excess tax benefit and employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding
purposes. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017
 and interim periods within those fiscal
years. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. There was no impact to the consolidated financial

December 15

 early adoption is permitted
 including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments
in an interim period
 any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period.
The amendments in Part I of this Update should be applied in either of the following ways: (1) Retrospectively to outstanding
financial instruments with a down round feature by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the statement of financial position

presented in accordance with the guidance on accounting changes in paragraphs 250-10-45-5 through 45-10. The amendments in Part
I and Part II of this Update do not require any transition guidance because those amendments do not have an accounting effect.

A
valuation allowance was not provided at October 31
 2019 or 2018. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets
 management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those
temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 projected future
taxable income
 and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections
for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are expected to be deductible
 management believes
it is more likely than not the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of the deferred tax
asset considered realizable
 however
 could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced.

As
of October 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits or open tax positions. The Company&rsquo;s
practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of October 31
 2019
and 2018
 the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to income taxes. The Company currently has no federal or state
tax examinations in progress.

The
Company files a U.S. federal income tax return and California

10 - ECONOMIC DEPENDENCY:

Approximately
19% of the Company&rsquo;s sales were derived from six customers during the year ended October 31
 2019. These customers
also accounted for approximately $3
109
000 or 33% of the Company&rsquo;s accounts receivable balance at October 31
 2019. Approximately
26% of the Company&rsquo;s sales were derived from four customers during the year ended October 31
 2018. These customers also
accounted for approximately $2
856
000 or 29% of the Company&rsquo;s accounts receivable balance at October 31
 2018. Concentration
of credit risk with respect to other trade receivables is limited due to the short payment terms generally extended by the Company
by ongoing credit evaluations of customers
 and by maintaining an allowance for doubtful accounts and other allowances that management
believes will adequately provide for credit losses.

For
the year ended October 31
 2019
 approximately 26% of the Company&rsquo;s purchases were from six vendors. These vendors accounted
for approximately $1
005
000 of the Company&rsquo;s accounts payable at October 31
 2019. For the year ended October 31
 2018
approximately 26% of the Company&rsquo;s purchases were from six vendors. These vendors accounted for approximately $726
000 of
the Company&rsquo;s accounts payable at October 31
 2018. Management does not believe the loss of any one vendor would have a
material adverse effect of the Company&rsquo;s operations due to the availability of many alternate suppliers.

The
Company recorded $476
899 of stock-based compensation

NOTE
13 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS:

Fair
value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date
 not adjusted for transaction costs. The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels giving the highest priority
to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs
(Level 3) as described below:

Level
1 Inputs &ndash; Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible by the Company;

Level
2 Inputs &ndash; Quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable
either directly or indirectly;

Level
3 Inputs &ndash; Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability including significant assumptions of the Company and other market
participants.

The
Company determines fair values for its investment assets as follows:

Investments
at fair value consist of commodity securities and deferred compensation plan assets.

The
Company maintains a deferred compensation plan. The fair value of the plan assets are classified within Level 1 as the assets
are valued using quoted prices in active markets. The assets are included with Deposits and other assets in the accompanying balance
sheets. Additional information related to the Company&rsquo;s deferred compensation plan is disclosed in Note 11.

The
Company&rsquo;s commodity securities are classified within Level 2 and include coffee futures and options contracts. To determine
fair value
 the Company utilizes the market approach valuation technique for the coffee futures and options contracts. The Company
uses Level 2 inputs that are based on market data of similar instruments that are in observable markets. All commodities on the
balance sheet are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in earnings.

The
following tables present the Company&rsquo;s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are
categorized using the fair value hierarchy.

Exhibit
4.2


DESCRIPTION
OF CAPITAL STOCK

The
following is a summary of all material characteristics of our capital stock as set forth in our articles of incorporation and
bylaws. The summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our articles of incorporation
and bylaws and applicable provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes
 as amended (&ldquo;NRS&rdquo;).

Common
Stock

We
are authorized to issue 30
000
000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. As of January 25
 2018
 there
were 5
742
894 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.

The
following summary of the terms of our common stock is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to our articles of
incorporation and bylaws
 copies of which are on file with the SEC as exhibits to previous SEC filings.

Voting
Rights

Each
outstanding share of common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. There are no cumulative
voting rights. Removal of directors requires the vote
 in addition to any vote required by law
 of not less than eighty percent
(80%) of the total votes eligible to be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally
in the election of directors at a meeting of stockholders expressly called for that purpose. The approval of the holders of at
least eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding shares of voting stock of the Corporation is required in connection with certain
&ldquo;Business Combinations&rdquo; with an Interested Stockholder
 as defined in the NRS
 after the expiration of three years
after the date the person becomes an Interested stockholder
 except in cases where the proposed Business Combination has been
approved in advance by a majority of those members of the board of directors who are unaffiliated with the Interested Stockholder
and who were directors prior to the time when the Interested Stockholder became an Interested Stockholder. Any alteration
 amendment
repeal or rescission of any provision of our articles of incorporation must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders
of at least eighty percent (80%) of the total votes eligible to be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of capital stock
entitled to vote thereon; provided
 however
 if a majority of the board of directors recommends the change
 then such change shall
only require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total votes eligible to be cast by the holders of all outstanding
shares of Capital Stock entitled to vote thereon. Any bylaw may be altered
 amended
 rescinded
 or repealed by the holders of
eighty percent (80%) of the shares of capital stock entitled to vote thereon at any annual meeting or at any special meeting called
for that purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 any provision of the bylaws that contains a supermajority voting requirement
shall only be altered
 amended
 rescinded
 or repealed by a vote of the board of directors or holders of shares of capital stock
entitled to vote thereon that is not less than the supermajority specified in such provision.



Each
stockholder is entitled to receive the dividends as may be declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for
dividends and
 in the event of liquidation
 to share pro rata in any distribution of our assets after payment of liabilities.
Our board of directors is not obligated to declare a dividend. Any future dividends will be subject to the discretion of our board
of directors and will depend upon
 among other things
 future earnings
 the operating and financial condition of our company
its capital requirements
 general business conditions and other pertinent factors.

Other
Rights

Upon
liquidation
 dissolution or winding up of the corporation
 the holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in all net
assets available for distribution to stockholders after payment to creditors. Our common stock is not convertible or redeemable
and has no preemptive
 subscription or conversion rights. There is no conversion
 redemption
 sinking fund or similar provisions
regarding our common stock.


    
    


Transfer
Agent

The
transfer agent and registrar for our Common Stock is Direct Transfer LLC. Its address is 500 Perimeter Park Drive
 Suite D
 Morrisville
North Carolina 27560 and its telephone number is (919) 481-4000. The transfer agent and registrar for any series or class of preferred
stock will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement.

Preferred
Stock

We
are authorized to issue up to 10
000
000 shares of preferred stock
 par value $0.001 per share
 with such designations
 rights
and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors. Accordingly
 our board of directors is empowered
without stockholder approval
 to issue preferred stock with dividend
 liquidation
 conversion
 voting
 or other rights that could
adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could have
the effect of restricting dividends on our common stock (if any are declared)
 diluting the voting power of our common stock
impairing the liquidation rights of our common stock
 or delaying or preventing a change in control of our company
 all without
further action by our stockholders. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 no shares of our preferred stock were outstanding.


Stock
Options



outstanding options to purchase up to 1
000
000 shares of common stock
 exercisable at $5.43 per share.




Anti-Takeover
Effects of Certain Provisions of Nevada Law and Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws

Our
articles of incorporation and bylaws contain a number of provisions that could make our acquisition by means of a tender or exchange
offer
 a proxy contest or otherwise more difficult. Certain of these provisions are summarized below.

Classified
Board of Directors

Pursuant
to our articles of incorporation
 the directors constituting our board of directors are classified
 with respect to the time for
which they severally hold office
 into three classes as nearly equal in number as possible. At each annual meeting of stockholders
the successors of the class of directors whose term expires at that meeting are elected to hold office for a term expiring at
the annual meeting of stockholders held in the third year following the year of their election. The articles of incorporation
do provide
 however
 that directors may be removed at any time upon the approval of eighty percent (80%) of the total votes eligible
to be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote at a meeting expressly called by stockholders
for such purpose.

Our
classified board of directors may have an anti-takeover effect of making more difficult and discouraging a takeover attempt
 merger
tender offer
 or proxy fight. Additionally
 our classified board of directors extends the time it would take for holders of a
majority of our shares to remove incumbent management to obtain control of the board of directors. That is
 as a general matter
a majority shareholder could not obtain control of the board of directors until the second annual shareholder&rsquo;s meeting
after it acquired a majority of the voting stock. Our classified board of directors may have the effect of making it more difficult
for stockholders to remove our existing management.

Special
Meetings

Our
articles of incorporation provide that special meetings of our stockholders may
 unless otherwise prescribed by law
 be called
only by resolution of a majority of the directors of the board then in office
 by resolution of a majority of the disinterested
directors then in office
 or upon written application
 by stockholders holding at least 80% of the capital stock entitled to vote
at the meeting. Our stockholders are not permitted to act by written consent pursuant to our articles of incorporation.


    
    


Business
Combinations Act

The
Business Combinations Act
 Sections 78.411 to 78.444 of the NRS
 restricts the ability of a Nevada &ldquo;resident domestic corporation&rdquo;
having at least 200 stockholders of record to engage in any &ldquo;combination&rdquo; with an &ldquo;interested stockholder&rdquo;
for two (2) years after the date that the person first became an interested stockholder
 unless the combination meets all of the
requirements of the articles of incorporation of the resident domestic corporation and (i) the purchase of shares by the interested
stockholder is approved by the board of directors before that date or (ii) the combination is approved by the board of directors
of the resident domestic corporation and
 at or after that time
 the combination is approved at an annual or special meeting of
the stockholders of the resident domestic corporation
 and not by written consent
 by the affirmative vote of the holders of stock
representing at least sixty percent (60%) of the outstanding voting power of the resident domestic corporation not beneficially
owned by the interested stockholder or the affiliates or associates of the interested stockholder.

If
this approval is not obtained
 then after the expiration of the two (2) year period
 the business combination may still not be
consummated unless it is a combination meeting all of the requirements of the articles of incorporation of the resident domestic
corporation and either the &ldquo;fair price&rdquo; requirements specified in NRS 78.441 to 78.444
 inclusive are satisfied or
the combination is (a) a combination or transaction by which the person first became an interested stockholder is approved by
the board of directors of the resident domestic corporation before the person first became an interested stockholder
 or (b) a
combination approved by a majority of the outstanding voting power of the resident domestic corporation not beneficially owned
by the interested stockholder
 or any affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder.

&ldquo;Interested
stockholder&rdquo; means any person
 other than the resident domestic corporation or its subsidiaries
 who is (a) the beneficial
owner
 directly or indirectly
 of 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the resident domestic corporation
or (b) an affiliate or associate of the resident domestic corporation and at any time within two years immediately before the
date in question was the beneficial owner
 directly or indirectly
 of 10% or more of the voting power of the then outstanding
shares of the resident domestic corporation.

A
&ldquo;combination&rdquo; is broadly defined and includes
 for example
 any merger or consolidation of a corporation or any of
its subsidiaries with (i) an interested stockholder or (ii) any other entity that after and as a result of the merger or consolidation
would be an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder; or any sale
 lease
 exchange
 pledge
 transfer or other disposition
of assets of the corporation
 in one transaction or a series of transactions
 to or with an interested stockholder having: (x)
an aggregate market value equal to more than 5% of the aggregate market value of the assets of a corporation
 (y) an aggregate
market value equal to more than 5% of the aggregate market value of all outstanding voting shares of a corporation
 or (z) representing
more than 10% of the earning power or net income of a corporation.

The
provisions of Nevada law
 our articles of incorporation and our bylaws could have the effect of discouraging others from attempting
hostile takeovers and
 as a consequence
 they may also inhibit temporary fluctuations in the market price of our common stock
that often result from actual or rumored hostile takeover attempts. These provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes
in our management. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that stockholders
may otherwise deem to be in their best interests.

Limitations
of Director Liability and Indemnification of Directors
 Officers and Employees

Neither
our articles of incorporation nor bylaws prevent us from indemnifying our officers
 directors and agents to the extent permitted
under the NRS. NRS Section 78.7502
 provides that a corporation shall indemnify any director
 officer
 employee or agent of a
corporation against expenses
 including attorneys&rsquo; fees
 actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with any
defense to the extent that a director
 officer
 employee or agent of a corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise
in defense of any action
 suit or proceeding referred to Section 78.7502(1) or 78.7502(2)
 or in defense of any claim
 issue or
matter therein. NRS 78.7502(1) provides that a corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to
be made a party to any threatened
 pending or completed action
 suit or proceeding
 whether civil
 criminal
 administrative or
investigative
 except an action by or in the right of the corporation
 by reason of the fact that he is or was a director
 officer
employee or agent of the corporation
 or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director
 officer
 employee
or agent of another corporation
 partnership
 joint venture
 trust or other enterprise
 against expenses
 including attorneys&rsquo;
fees
 judgments
 fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the action
 suit
or proceeding if he: (a) is not liable pursuant to NRS 78.138; or (b) acted in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation
 and
 with respect to any criminal action or proceeding
had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.

NRS
Section 78.7502(2) provides that a corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party
to any threatened
 pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor
by reason of the fact that he is or was a director
 officer
 employee or agent of the corporation
 or is or was serving at the
request of the corporation as a director
 officer
 employee or agent of another corporation
 partnership
 joint venture
 trust
or other enterprise against expenses
 including amounts paid in settlement and attorneys&rsquo; fees actually and reasonably incurred
by him in connection with the defense or settlement of the action or suit if he: (a) is not liable pursuant to NRS 78.138; or
(b) acted in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.

Goodwill and trademarks are not amortized&#13;but are assigned to a specific reporting unit or asset class and tested for impairment at least annually or upon the occurrence&#13;of an event or when circumstances indicate that the reporting unit&amp;#8217;s carrying amount of goodwill and trademarks is greater&#13;than its fair value.

The Company&#13;recognizes revenue in accordance with the five-step model as prescribed by ASU 606 in which the Company evaluates the transfer&#13;of promised goods or services and recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount&#13;that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To&#13;determine revenue recognition for the arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASU 606
 the Company performs&#13;the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer
 (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract

 Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-01 requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating&#13;leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability)&#13;and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months&#13;or less
 a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets&#13;and lease liabilities. In transition
 lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the&#13;earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU&#13;2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years (i.e.
 January&#13;1
 2019
 for a calendar year entity). Nonpublic business entities should apply the amendments for fiscal years beginning after&#13;December 15
 2019 (i.e.
 January 1
 2020
 for a calendar year entity)
 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after&#13;December 15
 2020. Early application is permitted for all public business entities and all nonpublic business entities upon issuance.&#13;The Company adopted Topic 842 effective November 1

 2019 or 2018. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets
 management considers whether it is more likely&#13;than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets&#13;is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.&#13;Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 projected future taxable income
 and tax planning strategies&#13;in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the&#13;periods in which the deferred tax assets are expected to be deductible
 management believes it is more likely than not the Company&#13;will realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable

 2018 and has used the modified retrospective method. The majority of the Company&amp;#8217;s business is ship and bill.&#13;Based on our analysis
 the Company did not identify a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings at November 1
 2018. The&#13;Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the five-step model as prescribed by ASU 606 in which the Company evaluates the&#13;transfer of promised goods or services and recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services&#13;in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or&#13;services. To determine revenue recognition for the arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASU 606
 the&#13;Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer
 (2) identify the performance obligations&#13;in the contract
 (3) determine the transaction price

 no agreement has yet been reached to extend or renew the facility at this time. Management believes&#13;that the Company has substantial excess working capital and the ability to manage expenditures in the near-term to ensure that&#13;there is sufficient liquidity available to repay the loan at its stated maturity date in the event of non-renewal. This plan could&#13;include deferring certain discretionary spending
 extending the payment dates of certain trade liabilities that the Company has&#13;traditionally paid in thirty days or less and taking advantage of the availability of inventory that was sourced at favorable&#13;prices. The Company further believes that should the loan be repaid in the event of a non-renewal

sales were derived from&#160;six&#160;customers during the year ended October 31
 2019. These customers also accounted for approximately
$3
109
000 or 33% of the Company&#8217;s accounts receivable balance at October 31
 2019. Approximately 26% of the Company&#8217;s
sales were derived from four customers during the year ended October 31
 2018. These customers also accounted for approximately
$2
856
000 or 29% of the Company&#8217;s accounts receivable balance at October 31
 2018. Concentration of credit risk with respect
to other trade receivables is limited due to the short payment terms generally extended by the Company
 by ongoing credit evaluations
of customers
 and by maintaining an allowance for doubtful accounts and other allowances that management believes will adequately
provide for credit losses.


 2019
approximately 26% of the Company&#8217;s purchases were from six vendors. These vendors accounted for approximately $1
005
000
of the Company&#8217;s accounts payable at October 31
 2019. For the year ended October 31
 2018
 approximately 26% of the Company&#8217;s
purchases were from six vendors. These vendors accounted for approximately $726
000 of the Company&#8217;s accounts payable at
October 31
 2018. Management does not believe the loss of any one vendor would have a material adverse effect of the Company&#8217;s
operations due to the availability of many alternate suppliers.

Investment in short-term money-market instruments (such as commercial paper
 banker's acceptances
 repurchase agreements
 government securities
 certificates of deposit
 and so forth) which are highly liquid (that is
 readily convertible to known amounts of cash) and so near their maturity that they present an insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally
 only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify as cash equivalents by definition. Original maturity means an original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example
 both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However
 a Treasury note purchased three-years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months.

techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3) as described below:


quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible by the Company;


in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable
 either directly or indirectly;


inputs for the asset or liability including significant assumptions of the Company and other market participants.

NOTE 3 - RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
AFFECTING THE COMPANY:


ASU 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-01 requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating
leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability)
and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months
or less
 a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets
and lease liabilities. In transition
 lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the
earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU
2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years (i.e.
 January
1
 2019
 for a calendar year entity). Nonpublic business entities should apply the amendments for fiscal years beginning after
December 15
 2019 (i.e.
 January 1
 2020
 for a calendar year entity)
 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after
December 15
 2020. Early application is permitted for all public business entities and all nonpublic business entities upon issuance.
The Company adopted Topic 842 effective November 1
 2019 using a modified retrospective method and will not restate comparative
periods. Upon adoption
 the Company recorded a right-to-use asset of $2.5 million and a corresponding lease liability of approximately
$2.7 million on the Company&#8217;s balance sheet with the difference relating to reclassifications of the deferred rent liability
as a reduction to the right-to-use asset for its operating lease. Adoption of the new lease standard will not have a significant
impact on the Company&#8217;s statement of operations.


Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09). The amendment simplifies several
aspects of the accounting for share-based payments
 including immediate recognition of all excess tax benefits and deficiencies
in the income statement
 changing the threshold to qualify for equity classification up to the employees&#8217; maximum statutory
tax rates
 allowing an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest
or account for forfeitures as they occur
 and clarifying the classification on the statement of cash flows for the excess tax benefit
and employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15
 2017
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or
annual period. There was no impact to the consolidated financial statements upon adoption as of November 1
 2018


 the FASB issued ASU
2017-11
 &#8220;Earnings Per Share (Topic 260)
 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480)
 Derivatives and Hedging (Topic
815): I. Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features
 II. Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for
Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests
with a Scope Exception&#8221; which addresses narrow issues identified as a result of the complexity associated with applying
generally accepted accounting principles for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. These
amendments in Part I of this update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2018
 early adoption
is permitted
 including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period
 any adjustments
should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The amendments in Part I of this
Update should be applied in either of the following ways: (1) Retrospectively to outstanding financial instruments with a down
round feature by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the statement of financial position as of the beginning of the first
fiscal year and interim period(s) in which the pending content that links to this paragraph is effective. (2) Retrospectively
to outstanding financial instruments with a down round feature for each prior reporting period presented in accordance with the
guidance on accounting changes in paragraphs 250-10-45-5 through 45-10. The amendments in Part I and Part II of this Update do
not require any transition guidance because those amendments do not have an accounting effect.



































The entire disclosure of changes in accounting principles
 including adoption of new accounting pronouncements
 that describes the new methods
 amount and effects on financial statement line items.

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]









 Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;)
conducts wholesale coffee operations
 including manufacturing
 roasting
 packaging
 marketing and distributing roasted and blended
coffees for private labeled accounts and its own brands
 and it sells green coffee. The Company&#8217;s core product
 coffee
 can
be summarized and divided into three product categories (&#8220;product lines&#8221;) as follows:

&#160;unroasted
raw beans imported from around the world and sold to large and small roasters and coffee shop operators;

&#160;coffee
roasted
 blended
 packaged and sold under the specifications and names of others
 including supermarkets that want to have their
own brand name on coffee to compete with national brands; and

&#160;coffee
roasted and blended to the Company&#8217;s own specifications and packaged and sold under the Company&#8217;s eight proprietary
and licensed brand names in different segments of the market.


and branded coffee sales are primarily to customers that are located throughout the United States with limited sales in Canada
and certain countries in Asia. Such customers include supermarkets
 wholesalers
 and individually-owned and multi-unit retailers.
The Company&#8217;s unprocessed green coffee
 which includes over 90 specialty coffee offerings
 is sold primarily to specialty
gourmet roasters and to coffee shop operators in the United States with limited sales in Australia
 Canada
 England and China.


private label
 and branded coffee product categories generate revenues and cost of sales individually but incur selling
 general
and administrative expenses in the aggregate. There are no individual product managers and discrete financial information is not
available for any of the product lines. The Company&#8217;s product portfolio is used in one business and it operates and competes
in one business activity and economic environment. In addition
 the three product lines share customers
 manufacturing resources
sales channels
 and marketing support. Thus
 the Company considers the three product lines to be one single reporting segment.







The entire disclosure for the nature of an entity's business
 major products or services
 principal markets including location
 and the relative importance of its operations in each business and the basis for the determination
 including but not limited to
 assets
 revenues
 or earnings. For an entity that has not commenced principal operations

before non controlling interest in subsidiary and had negative cash flows from operating activities of approximately $2.1 million
for the year ended October 31
 2019. The Company&#8217;s working capital amounted to $20
227
944 at October 31
 2019
 which includes
approximately $2
400
000 ($2
700
000 at January 27
 2020) of cash and cash equivalents and an increased level of inventory purchased
at reduced prices
 which management believes is a significant source of near term liquidity. The Company also has outstanding
bank borrowings of $7
167
740 (approximately $5
200
000 at January 27
 2020) under a line of credit that matures on March 31
2010. The Company is currently engaged in discussions with several lenders to either renew or extend the line of credit prior
to its expiration; however
 no agreement has yet been reached to extend or renew the facility at this time. Management believes
that the Company has substantial excess working capital and the ability to manage expenditures in the near-term to ensure that
there is sufficient liquidity available to repay the loan at its stated maturity date in the event of non-renewal. This plan could
include deferring certain discretionary spending
 extending the payment dates of certain trade liabilities that the Company has
traditionally paid in thirty days or less and taking advantage of the availability of inventory that was sourced at favorable
prices. The Company further believes that should the loan be repaid in the event of a non-renewal
 there is substantial liquidity
available to fund operations through the remainder of the twelve month period following the issuance date of the financial statements.

financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Significant estimates include
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable and reserves
 inventory obsolescence
 depreciation
 intangible asset valuations
and useful lives
 taxes
 contingencies
 and valuation of financial instruments. These estimates may be adjusted as more current
information becomes available
 and any adjustment could have a significant impact on recorded amounts.

at the amount the Company expects to collect. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting
from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Management considers the following factors when determining the
collectability of specific customer accounts: customer credit-worthiness
 past transaction history with the customer
 current economic
industry trends
 and changes in customer payment terms. Past due balances over 60 days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed
individually for collectability. If the financial condition of the Company&#8217;s customers were to deteriorate
 adversely affecting
their ability to make payments
 additional allowances would be required. Based on management&#8217;s assessment
 the Company provides
for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance. Balances that remain outstanding
after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit
to accounts receivable.

its goodwill and trademarks
 which consist of product lines
 trade names and packaging designs have an indefinite useful life.
The value of the goodwill and trademarks was allocated based on an independent valuation. Goodwill and trademarks are not amortized
but are assigned to a specific reporting unit or asset class and tested for impairment at least annually or upon the occurrence
of an event or when circumstances indicate that the reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount of goodwill and trademarks is greater
than its fair value. As of October 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company has determined by using a qualitative assessment that an impairment
did not exist. In 2011
 the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard ASB ASU 2011-08 Intangibles &#8211; Goodwill and Other
&#8211; Testing Goodwill for Impairment
 which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is
necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under this amendment
 an entity would not be required
to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines
 based on a qualitative assessment
 that it is more
likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The amendment includes a number of events and circumstances
for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment.

taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method which requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be computed for
temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible
amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect
taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be
realized. The income tax provision or benefit is the tax incurred for the period plus or minus the change during the period in
deferred tax assets and liabilities.








computed by dividing net income by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per common
share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect
of common shares issuable upon exercise of potential sources of dilution. The company has issued 689
000 options as of October
31
 2019
 they have not been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because of their anti-dilutitive value


outstanding used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share were 5

31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.








 accounts
receivable
 notes receivable
 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of
these instruments. The carrying amount of the bank line of credit borrowings approximates fair value because the debt is based
on current rates at which the Company could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities. Fair value estimates are made at a
specific point in time
 based on relevant market information about the financial instruments when available. These estimates are
subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore
 cannot be determined with precision.
Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.








accounting policy for revenue was updated as a result of the adoption of ASU Topic 606. The Company has adopted the new standard
on November 1
 2018 and has used the modified retrospective method. The majority of the Company&#8217;s business is ship and bill.
Based on our analysis
 the Company did not identify a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings at November 1
 2018. The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the five-step model as prescribed by ASU 606 in which the Company evaluates the
transfer of promised goods or services and recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services
in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or
services. To determine revenue recognition for the arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASU 606
 the
Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer
 (2) identify the performance obligations
in the contract
 (3) determine the transaction price
 (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the
contract and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. See Note 11 for revenue disaggregated
by product line.
