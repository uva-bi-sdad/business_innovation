Sipup Corporation was incorporated on October 31
 2012 under the laws of the State of Nevada for the purpose of producing
 packing and selling flavored yogurts. &#160;

We are a development stage company that has not realized any revenues to date
 and our accumulated deficit as of November 30
 2013&#160;is $69
803. &#160;To date we have raised an aggregate of $66
823 through the sales of our securities and from stockholders loans. Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion for our Company which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. &#160;The Company&#8217;s principal offices are located at 245 Park Avenue
 New York
 NY
 10167. Our telephone number is 212 792-4000.



On October 31
 2012
 the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada. We were formed to produce
 pack
 and sell flavored yogurts. We are in the development stage
 and have not realized any revenues from our operations.


    
    



Rashid Naeem has served as our President
 Chief Executive Officer
 Secretary and Treasurer
 from October 31
 2012
 until December 5
 2013 and was replaced following his resignation by Jacob Daddon. Our board of directors is comprised of one person: Jacob Daddon. &#160;
We are authorized to issue 75
000
000 shares of common stock
 par value $.001 per share. On November 19
 2012
 we issued 3
000
000 shares of common stock to our sole officer and director on that date. Mr. Naeem purchased such 3
000
000 shares at a purchase price of $0.001 per share
 for an aggregate purchase price of $3
000.

On December 5
 2013
 Mr. Nissim Barih (&#8220;Barih&#8221;) and several other unrelated persons (each a &#8220;Buyer&#8221; and collectively
 the &#8220;Buyers&#8221;)
 closed on a transaction (the &#8220;Purchase&#8221;) in which the Buyers acquired a total of 3
000
000 shares (the &#8220;Shares&#8221;) of common stock
 par value $0.001 per share (the &#8220;Common Stock&#8221;) of Sipup from Rashid Naeem
 the Company&#8217;s sole director and officer (&#8220;Naeem&#8221;) immediately prior to the Purchase. The Purchase was consummated pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement by and among the Buyers and Naeem. The aggregate purchase price paid for the Shares was $131
000. &#160;The Shares represented&#160;&#160;in the aggregate 75% of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock.&#160;&#160;Barih
 one of the Buyers
 holds 2
475
000 of the Shares
 representing approximately 61% of all of our issued and outstanding Common Stock. The funds used to consummate the Purchase of the Shares were the personal funds of each participating Buyer. Accordingly
 the purchase of the Shares resulted in a change in control of the Company.

In connection with the above transaction
 Naeem resigned from all officers&#8217; positions that he held in the Company
 including President
 Chief Executive Officer
 Secretary and Treasurer
 which resignation became effective immediately upon the closing of the Purchase.&#160;&#160;Contemporaneously with closing of the Purchase
 Jacob Daddon was appointed as our President and Chief Executive Officer and one of our directors.



We were incorporated on October 31
 2012 in the State of Nevada. &#160;We have never declared bankruptcy
 have never been in receivership
 and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. &#160;Since incorporation
 we have not made any significant purchase or sale of assets. &#160;We are not a blank check registrant as that term is defined in Rule 419(a)(2) of Regulation C of the Securities Act of 1933
 since we have a specific business plan or purpose.

From inception until the date of this filing we have had limited operating activities
 primarily consisting of the incorporation of our company
 the initial equity funding by our officer and sole director
 contacting FDA
 and&#160;preparing our recipes.&#160;&#160;Our financial statements from inception (October 31
 2012) through our fiscal year ended November 30
 2013 report no revenues and a net loss of $69
803. &#160;Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion for our Company which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.

We are a development stage company which plans to be in the business of producing
 packing
 and selling flavored yogurts. To implement our plan of operations we require a minimum funding of $25
000 for the next twelve months. &#160;After twelve months period&#160;we may need additional financing. &#160;If we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $25
000 of additional funding to pay for SEC filing requirements.&#160;&#160;We have no revenues and have incurred losses since inception. The Company&#8217;s principal offices are located at 245 Park Avenue
 New York
 NY
 10167. Our telephone number is 212 792-4000.

Our operations to date have been devoted primarily to start-up and development activities
 which include:











Our flavored yogurt recipes currently include all fruit flavors. The following list follows what we will be making: Apple
 apricot
 blueberry
 cherry
 peach
 orange
 pear
 and strawberry. Our flavors under development will include all the following products: Carrot
 cucumber
 raisin
 almonds and more as we expand the business. All of our flavored yogurts will have sugar added to them. &#160;The yogurt business has a lot of competition especially in the recent decades as many flavored and frozen yogurt companies have surfaced. Some of the world&#8217;s most established and biggest yogurt companies started out in Europe and we will face immense competition from these established companies. We plan to manufacture
 distribute and conduct our planned business from Germany but once we establish our brand like other yogurt companies we will have our yogurts made and distributed all over the place.


    
    





We intend to produce
 pack
 and sell our flavored yogurts and market them. We have contacted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the product labeling procedure
 and registration requirement of our manufacturing facility. We have not registered our facility with FDA as we will once we setup our office and warehouse. &#160;We plan to have our flavored yogurts shelved and refrigerated at local grocery stores and at bigger retailers and wholesalers.

As we will be new in the business
 we will require full payments from our customers prior to releasing our flavored yogurts. &#160;Potential customers will have two options to pay: by wire transfer or by sending a check/money order. &#160;Our customers will be responsible to cover the transporting costs for bigger quantities
 as we will not be able to transport products in big quantity. &#160;We plan to purchase or lease out delivery vehicles once we start making revenue. Once the customer becomes a regular client we will take a partial deposit to have our product released at our own expense and risk. &#160;



We plan to market our yogurts locally initially.&#160;&#160;We intend to develop and maintain a database of potential small grocery stores locally who may want to buy and have our yogurts put in their refrigerators. Our methods of communication will include: phone calls
 email
 and regular mail. &#160;We will ask our satisfied customers for referrals. &#160;To draw attention from potential customers we plan to market and advertise our company though social networking. We intend to use Facebook and Twitter to spread information about our flavored yogurts.



We do not maintain any insurance. Because we do not have any insurance
 if we are made a party of a legal action
 we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.



We are a development stage company and currently have no employees. Our sole officer and director
 is a non-employee officer and director of the Company. We intend to hire employees on an as needed basis. Our sole officer and director handles the company&#8217;s day to day operations.



The Company&#8217;s principal offices are located at 245 Park Avenue
 New York
 NY
 10167. Our telephone number is 212 792-4000.



We will be required to comply with all regulations
 rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities in the future. As of now there are no required government approvals present that we need approval from or any existing government regulation on our business.

However once we start producing
 and packing flavored yogurts we will be required to comply with all regulations
 rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies. We do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business. We do not need to receive any government approvals necessary to conduct our business and do not need to demonstrate that; however we will have to comply with all applicable export
 import
 and product labeling regulations. Also our flavored yogurts shall comply with all applicable Federal regulations including those contained in the Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s Standard of Identity for Yogurt (21 CFR Part 131.200).

We currently have not obtained any copyrights
 patents or trademarks. We do not anticipate filing any copyright or trademark applications related to any assets over the next 12 months.


    
    





Our cash balance is $Nil as of November 30
 2013. We do not believe that our cash balance is sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations beyond one year&#8217;s time.



We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations
 if any
 will be insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. We will require additional funds prior to such time and the Company will seek to obtain theses funds by selling additional capital through private equity placements
 debt or other sources of financing. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional financing
 we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned operations
 which could harm our business
 financial condition and operating results. Additional funding to meet our requirements may not be available on favorable terms
 if at all.

At the present time
 we have been able to raise additional cash by selling of common stock
 it will likely not be sufficient to support our planned operations. If we are unable to raise the cash needed to support our operations
 we will either suspend product development and marketing activities until we do raise the cash
 or cease operations entirely

In the next twelve months
 we plan to engage in the following activities to expand our business operations:

(1) In the first and second months after receiving sufficient financing
 we plan to set up an office and a small warehouse for operations and storage. Our officer and director will handle our administrative duties.

(2) In the third and fourth months after receiving sufficient financing
 we plan to buy used or lease cheap machinery for our flavored yogurts to be produced
 and packed in-house instead of out-sourcing to other companies to save costs. We also plan to purchase ingredients and yogurt containers necessary to make and pack the yogurts.

(3) In the fifth and sixth months after receiving sufficient financing
 we plan to have a small promotion by sampling our flavored yogurts out to businesses for a feedback and to get our companies name out in the communities and to improve on our flavors.



(5) In the ninth and tenth months after receiving sufficient financing
 we plan to meet with bigger retailers and wholesalers to have our flavored yogurts put on shelves at their stores.

(6) In the eleventh and twelfth months after receiving sufficient financing
 we plan to come out with more flavors of our flavored yogurts under our company&#8217;s name and market them as well.

Subject to raising working capital
 management may also consider other business opportunities
 including a strategic merger or acquisition outside our current line of business
 in order to increase shareholder value.



We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition
 changes in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures or capital resources.



There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations and have not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise
 including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.

We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms
 we may be unable to continue
 develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders.


    
    













The
Company does not own or lease any property.



The Company is not party to any legal proceedings
 nor is there any known legal proceedings contemplated against the Company.

No director
 officer or affiliate of the Company and no owner of record or beneficial owner of more than 5.0% of the securities of the Company
 or any associate of any such director
 officer or security holder is a party adverse to the Company or has a material interest adverse to the Company in reference to pending litigation.

As
of the date of this&#160;Form 10-K&#160;the Company had 4
000

We have not declared or paid dividends on our common stock since our formation
 and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future. Declaration or payment of dividends
 if any
 in the future
 will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our then current financial condition
 results of operations
 capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. There are no contractual restrictions on our ability to declare or pay dividends.









From Inception (October 31
 2012) to November 30
 2013

During the period
 we incorporated the Company
 Our loss since inception is $69
803 related primarily to professional fees
 officers compensation
 the incorporation of the Company
 bank charges and office supplies. We have not meaningfully commenced our proposed business operations and will not do so until after receiving sufficient financing.

Since inception
 we have offered and sold (i) 3
000
000 shares of common stock to Rashid Naeem
 our former officer and a director
 at a purchase price of $0.001 per share
 for aggregate proceeds of $3
000 and we have offered and sold 1
000
000 shares at a purchase price of $0.05 per share
 for aggregate proceeds of $50
000.

For the fiscal year ended November 30
 2013
 we had no revenue and had expenses of $63
939 comprised of Officers compensation of $47
000
 Advertising and promotion of $89
 Professional fees of $16
240 and General and administrative expense of $610 resulting in a net loss of $63
939 as compared to expenses of $5
864 comprised of Officers compensation of $Nil
 Advertising and promotion of $Nil
 Professional fees of $5
010 and General and administrative expense of $854 resulting in a net loss of $5
864 for the fiscal year ended November 30
 2012.



As of November 30
 2013
 the company had $Nil cash and our liabilities were $4
735
 consisting primarily of Accounts payable and accrued expenses of $2
980 and Loans payable of $1
755. As of November 30
 2012
 the company had $2
993 cash and our liabilities were $5
857
 consisting of primarily professional fees
 the incorporation of the Company
 bank charges and office supplies. The available capital reserves of the Company are not sufficient for the Company to remain operational.

During 2013 and 2012 a stockholder advanced the Company $7
348 and $5
322
 respectively
 to pay expenses.&#160;&#160;Of this amount
 $2
328 was contributed to additional paid-in capital while the remainder of the loan was repaid.&#160;&#160;The loan was interest free and had a zero balance at November 30
 2013.

During 2013 and 2012 two stockholders advanced the Company $1
755 and $-0-
 respectively
 to pay expenses.&#160;&#160;The loans bear no interest and are payable on demand.

As of the date of this Form 10-K
 the current funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to continue maintaining a reporting status. Our primary priority will be to retain our reporting status with the SEC which means that we will first ensure by being a &#8220;reporting issuer&#8221; under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended.&#8221; that we have sufficient capital to cover our legal and accounting expenses. Once these costs are accounted for
 in accordance with how much cash we are able to retain
 we will focus on meeting all our planned expenses.

Our auditors have issued a &#8220;going concern&#8221; opinion
 meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until after receiving sufficient financing and implementing our plan of operations. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. The Company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately $25
000.

Existing working capital
 further advances and debt instruments
 and anticipated cash flow are expected to be inadequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally
 we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan
 management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. Although we intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities
 and debt issuances
 no assurance can be provided that we will be able to raise funds on commercially acceptable terms or at all.


    
    



We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations
 if any
 will be insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. We will require additional funds prior to such time and the Company will seek to obtain theses funds by selling additional capital through private equity placements
 debt or other sources of financing. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional financing
 we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned operations
 which could harm our business
 financial condition and operating results. Additional funding to meet our requirements may not be available on favorable terms
 if at all.

At the present time
 we have been able to raise additional cash by selling of common stock
 it will likely not be sufficient to support our planned operations. If we are unable to raise the cash needed to support our operations
 we will either suspend product development and marketing activities until we do raise the cash
 or cease operations entirely. Because we have been unable to raise additional cash
 Management may consider other business opportunities in order to maintain and increase shareholder value.

We are highly dependent upon the success of the private offerings of equity or debt securities
 as described herein. Therefore
 the failure thereof would result in the need to seek capital from other resources such as taking loans
 which would likely not even be possible for the Company. At such time these funds are required
 management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing. If the Company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its equity or debt securities
 or secure a loan
 the Company would be required to cease business operations. As a result
 investors would lose all of their investment.









Management uses estimates and assumption in preparing these financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
 the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
 and the reported revenues and expenses.



The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740 &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; which codified SFAS 109
 &#8220;Accounting for Income Taxes&#8221; and FIN 48 &#8220;Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes &#8211; an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.&#8221; Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740
 the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations.



Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820
 &#8220;Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments&#8221;
 requires the Company to disclose
 when reasonably attainable
 the fair market values of its assets and liabilities which are deemed to be financial instruments. The Company&#8217;s financial instruments consist primarily of cash.






    
    





Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 718. &#160;To date
 the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options.















Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by
 or under the supervision of
 the Company&#8217;s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company&#8217;s board of directors
 management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:








Pertains to the maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of assets;























Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.




Under the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our President and principal financial officer
 an evaluation was performed on the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation
 our President and principle executive officer
 who also acts as our principal financial officer
 concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report for the purpose of gathering
 analyzing and disclosing of information that the Company is required to disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms.



As of November 30
 2013 management assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#8220;COSO&#8221;) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation
 they concluded that
 during the period covered by this report
 such internal control over financial reporting were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal control over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.

The matters involving internal controls and procedures that the Company&#8217;s management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee due to the lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors
 resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (3) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of November 30
 2013.


    
    



Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2) and (3) above did not have an effect on our financial results. However
 management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors
 results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.

In an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls
 we have initiated or plan to initiate the following series of measures.



Management believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors
 who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee
 will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board.
We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements
 as necessary and as funds allow.

There have been no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report fourth quarter of 2013 which has materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal controls over financial reporting.

The director named above will serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders or until their respective resignation or removal from office. Thereafter

 of which none currently exists or is contemplated.

Rashid Naeem
 Age 42

Mr. Naeem has served as our President
 Chief Executive Officer
 Secretary
 Treasurer and a Director since our inception on October 31
 2012. Since March 2012 he has planned the formation and operation of the Company. Mr. Naeem has been making plain and flavoured yogurts for his personal use for over twenty years. Mr. Naeem decided in March that he should start his own company that produces
 packs
 and sells flavoured yogurts. Prior to the formation of the company Mr. Naeem has been self employed from 2007 until now and has been a wholesaler of bed sheets. He had them shipped in containers from Asia and sold them to storekeepers for a profit. These experiences
 qualifications and attributes have led to our conclusion that Mr. Naeem should be serving as a member of our Board of Director in light of our business and structure.


    
    



Jacob Daddon
 Age 33
Mr. Daddon has been engaged in the financial services industry in Israel since January 2008. &#160;Between October 2012 to the present
 Mr. Daddon has been providing financial advisory services to small business entities
 on an independent basis
 including performing economic feasibility analysis. &#160;From January 2011 through September 2012
 Mr. Daddon served as an economist with the Eilat Port Authority where his responsibilities included budgetary auditing
 operational management
 working on the privatization program and internal accounting functions. Between July 2009 and July 2010
 Mr. Daddon worked for Psagot
 a Tel Aviv based investment bank where his responsibilities included interacting with clients and prospective clients of the bank regarding investment products. &#160;Between December 2008 and July 2009
 Mr. Daddon worked at Bank Mizrahi in Tel Aviv where he was primarily responsible for managing clients&#8217; investment accounts as well as marketing investment products . Between January 2001through July2008
 Mr. Daddon held a managerial position with a publishing house. Mr. Daddon obtained a B.A. in Economics in 2008 from Ben Gurion University in Israel. Mr. Daddon is a resident of Israel and will continue to reside and work out of Israel following his appointment. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



Our board of director is currently composed of one member
 who does not qualify as an independent director in accordance with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market. The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests
 such as that the director is not
 and has not been for at least three years
 one of our employees and that neither the director
 nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. In addition
 our board of director has not made a subjective determination as to its sole director that no relationships exist which
 in the opinion of our board of director
 would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director
 though such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. &#160;Had our board of director made these determinations
 our board of director would have reviewed and discussed information provided by the director and us with regard to each director business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management.



During the period ended November 30
 2013
 Rashid Naeem
 our sole officer and a director
 was our only employee (though not &#8220;employees&#8221; for the purpose of determining employee status under tax laws).



Since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors
 the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our sole director. The Board of Director has not established an audit committee and does not have an audit committee financial expert
 nor has the Board established a nominating committee. The Board is of the opinion that such committees are not necessary since the Company is an early development stage company and has only one director
 and to date
 such director has been performing the functions of such committees. Thus
 there is a potential conflict of interest in that our director has the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation
 nominations
 and audit issues that may affect management decisions.



There are no legal proceedings that have occurred in the past 10 years concerning our sole officer and director which involved a criminal conviction
 a criminal proceeding
 an administrative or civil proceeding limiting one&#8217;s participation in the securities or banking industries
 or a finding of securities or commodities law violations.&#160;



The Company does not
 at present
 have any employees other than the current officers and director. We have not entered into any employment agreements
 as we currently do not have any employees other than the current officers and directors.






    
    





Since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors
 the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our directors. The Board of Directors has not established an audit committee and does not have an audit committee financial expert
 nor has the Board of Directors established a nominating committee. The Board is of the opinion that such committees are not necessary since the Company is an early exploration stage company and has only two directors
 and to date
 such directors have been performing the functions of such committees. Thus
 there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation
 nominations
 and audit issues that may affect management decisions.

There are no family relationships among our directors or officers. Other than as described above
 we are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executive officers or directors.



The Company has not adopted a code of ethics that applies to its principal executive officers
 principal financial officer
 principal accounting officer or controller
 or persons performing similar functions. The Company has not adopted a code of ethics because it has only commenced operations.



Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our executive officers and directors
 and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities
 file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Executive officers
 directors and greater-than-ten percent stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based on our review of filings made on the SEC website
 and the fact of us not receiving certain forms or written representations from certain reporting persons that they have complied with the relevant filing requirements
 we believe that
 during the year ended November 30
 2013
 none of our executive officers
 directors and greater-than-ten percent stockholders complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements.&#160;





The table below summarizes all compensation awarded to
 earned by
 or paid to our Officer for all services rendered in all capacities to us for the fiscal periods indicated.

We have not granted any stock options to the executive officer since our inception. Upon the further development of our business
 we will likely grant options to our sole director and officer consistent with industry standards for businesses similar to ours.



The Company is not a party to any employment agreement and during 2013 and thereafter had no compensation agreement with its then sole officer and director
 Rashid Naeem. Following December 5
 2013
 upon the resignation of Mr. Naeem and the appointment of Mr. Daddon

 the Company has no employment agreement with Mr. Daddon.

(ii) each officer and director of our Company; and (iii) all officers and directors as a group. Information relating to
beneficial ownership of common stock by our principal shareholders and management is based upon information furnished by each

direct the voting of the security. The person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any security of which that person
has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days. Under the Securities and Exchange Commission rules
 more than one
person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities
 and a person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of
securities as to which he or she may not have any pecuniary beneficial interest. Except as noted below
 each person has sole
voting and investment power.

The
percentages below are calculated based on 4
000
000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of March 14
 2014. We

 shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example
 upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person
 the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights.

FOR THE YEARS ENDED NOVEMBER 30
 2013 AND 2012





    
    


















































































    
    























We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Sipup Corporation
 (A Development Stage Company) as of November 30
 2013 and 2012
 and the related statements of operations
 deficit and cash flows for the years ended November 30
 2013 and 2012 and from inception (October 31
 2012) to November 30
 2013.&#160;&#160;These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management.&#160;&#160;Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.





We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.





In our opinion
 the financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of Sipup Corporation (A Development Stage Company) as of November 30
 2013 and 2012
 and results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended and from inception (October 31
 2012) to November 30
 2013
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.





The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements
 the Company has suffered a loss from operations and is in the development stage. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. Management&#8217;s plans in regard to this matter are also discussed in Note 5. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Sipup Corporation (&#8220;Sipup&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated on October 31
 2012
 under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company is in the development stage as defined under Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 915
 &#8220;Development Stage Entities&#8221;. The Company intends to produce flavored yogurts.





Basic net (loss) income per common share is calculated using the weighted average common shares outstanding during each reporting period. Diluted net (loss) income per common share adjusts the weighted average common shares for the potential dilution that could occur if common stock equivalents (convertible debt and preferred stock
 warrants
 stock options and restricted stock shares and units) were exercised or converted into common stock. There were no common stock equivalents at November 30
 2013.


Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences related to temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes at each year end
 based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized when
 based on the weight of all available evidence
 it is considered more likely than not that all
 or some portion
 of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Income tax expense is the sum of current income tax plus the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.

A company is required to determine whether it is more likely than not (which is defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date
 assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.


    
    






November 30
 2013 and 2012




The Company is required to estimate the fair value of all financial instruments included on its balance sheet as of November 30
 2013. The Company&#8217;s financial instruments consist of cash. The Company considers the carrying value of such amounts in the financial statements to approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments.









During 2013 and 2012 a stockholder advanced the Company $7
348 and $5
322
 respectively
 to pay expenses. Of this amount
 $2
328 was contributed to additional paid-in capital while the remainder of the loan was repaid. The loan was interest free and had a zero balance at November 30
 2013.

During 2013 and 2012 two stockholders advanced the Company $1
755 and $-0-
 respectively
 to pay expenses. The loans bear no interest and are payable on demand.



In October 2012
 the Company issued 3
000
000 shares of common stock at $0.001 per share.

In May 2013
 the Company issued 1
000
000 shares of common stock at $0.05 per share.


    
    






November 30
 2013 and 2012



































As of November 30
 2013
 the Company has a net operating loss carryforward of approximately $70
000. This loss will be available to offset future taxable income. If not used
 this carryforward will expire in 2032. The deferred tax asset relating to the operating loss carryforward has been fully reserved at November 30
 2013 due to the uncertainty of its recognition.



The Company&#8217;s financial statements are presented on a going concern basis
 which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.

The Company has experienced a loss from operations during its development stage as a result of its investment necessary to achieve its operating plan
 which is long-range in nature. From October 31
 2012 (inception) to November 30
 2013
 the Company incurred a net loss of approximately $70
000. In addition
 the Company has no significant assets or revenue generating operations.

The Company does not have sufficient cash to sustain itself for the next 12 months
 and will require additional funding in order to execute its plan of operations and to continue as a going concern. To meet its cash needs
 certain stockholders have agreed
 orally
 to loan
 on a non-interest bearing demand basis
 sufficient funds to maintain the Company&#8217;s operations for the next 12 months.




    
    






November 30
 2013 and 2012




In accordance with ASC 855
 management has evaluated the subsequent events through the date of issuance of the financial statements. Based upon this evaluation
 there are no subsequent events that require disclosure.

 based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized when
 based on the weight of all available evidence
 it is considered more likely than not that all
 or some portion
 of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Income tax expense is the sum of current income tax plus the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Sipup Corporation (&#8220;Sipup&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated on October 31

Basic net (loss) income per common share is calculated using the weighted average common shares outstanding during each reporting period. Diluted net (loss) income per common share adjusts the weighted average common shares for the potential dilution that could occur if common stock equivalents (convertible debt and preferred stock
 warrants
 stock options and restricted stock shares and units) were exercised or converted into common stock. There were no common stock equivalents at November 30

Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences related to temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes at each year end
 based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized when
 based on the weight of all available evidence
 it is considered more likely than not that all
 or some portion
 of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Income tax expense is the sum of current income tax plus the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.

A company is required to determine whether it is more likely than not (which is defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date
 assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.


The Company is required to estimate the fair value of all financial instruments included on its balance sheet as of November 30
 2013. The Company&#8217;s financial instruments consist of cash. The Company considers the carrying value of such amounts in the financial statements to approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments.
