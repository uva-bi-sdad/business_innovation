PART
I

ITEM
1. BUSINESS.



Mendocino
Brewing Company
 Inc.
 a California corporation
 was founded in 1983 as a limited partnership and converted to a corporation in
1993. We were one of the first modern craft brewers
 having opened the first new brewpub in California and the second in the United
States following the repeal of Prohibition. We have been recognized for our innovations in the brewpub concept
 our craft brew
style and our distinctive labels.

We
operate in two geographic markets
 (i) the United States and Canada (referred to in this Annual Report as the &ldquo;North American
Territory&rdquo;) and (ii) Europe (including Austria
 Belgium
 Denmark
 Ireland
 Italy
 the Netherlands
 France
 Finland
 Germany
Greece
 Iceland
 Liechtenstein
 Luxembourg
 Norway
 Portugal
 Spain
 Sweden
 Switzerland
 and the United Kingdom) (referred to
in this Annual Report as the &ldquo;Foreign Territory&rdquo;). Our Foreign Territory operations are primarily in the United Kingdom
which is also referred to in this Annual Report as the &ldquo;UK&rdquo;.

Our
operations in the North American Territory consist primarily of brewing and marketing proprietary craft beers
 including Red Tail
Ale
 Blue Heron Pale Ale
 Black Hawk Stout
 Eye of the Hawk Select Ale
 and White Hawk Original IPA
 and a licensed international
specialty beer
 Kingfisher Premium Lager. For distribution in the North American Territory
 we brew our brands in our own facilities
which are located in Ukiah
 California and Saratoga Springs
 New York. In the North American Territory
 we distribute our products
in most of the states
 the District of Columbia and Canada.

Our
operations in the Foreign Territory
 which are conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiary
 United Breweries International (U.K.)
Limited (&ldquo;UBIUK&rdquo;) and UBIUK&rsquo;s wholly-owned subsidiary
 Kingfisher Beer Europe Limited (&ldquo;KBEL&rdquo;)
consist primarily of the marketing and distribution of Kingfisher Premium Lager through Indian restaurants
 chain retail grocers
liquor stores
 and other retail outlets (such as convenience stores). We hold an exclusive license
 expiring in October 2018
from United Breweries Limited
 an Indian public limited company (&ldquo;UB Limited&rdquo;) to brew and distribute Kingfisher Premium
Lager in certain areas of the Foreign Territory. The Chairman of our board of directors
 Dr. Vijay Mallya
 is also the Chairman
of the board of directors of UB Limited.


    
    


All
of our beers sold in the Foreign Territory (except for beers sold in Germany) are brewed for us under a subcontract with Heineken
UK Limited (&ldquo;HUK&rdquo;). This subcontract expires in October 2018. KBEL is the distributor of Kingfisher Premium Lager
to specialty restaurant trade distributors
 liquor and convenience stores in the United Kingdom
 Ireland
 and continental Europe
but does not physically distribute our products to customers. KBEL contracts with HUK for distribution of the product in the Foreign
Territory in exchange for a fee paid to HUK
 except in Germany
 where beers are manufactured and distributed pursuant to a separate
contract with a different entity. In addition
 KBEL sublicenses to HUK the exclusive right to sell Kingfisher Premium Lager
 for
a royalty fee
 to certain large retail customers
 including
 but not limited to
 Sainsbury&rsquo;s
 Asda
 and Tesco.

COMPANY
BACKGROUND

We
first bottled our flagship brand
 Red Tail Ale
 in December 1983
 and conducted our initial public offering in February 1995.
We completed construction of our brewery in Ukiah
 California in May 1997. This facility
 which has a current annual packaging
capacity of 100
000 brewers&rsquo; barrels (&ldquo;bbl.&rdquo;) assuming one eight hour shift per day
 was designed to enable
our production capacity at such facility to be expanded to 200
000 bbl. per year with additional equipment.

Our
New York subsidiary
 Releta Brewing Company
 LLC
 d/b/a Ten Springs Brewery (&ldquo;Releta&rdquo;)
 which is located in Saratoga
Springs
 New York
 commenced production in our leased facilities in February 1998. This facility
 which has a current annual packaging
capacity of 100
000 bbl. assuming one eight hour shift per day
 was also designed to enable our production at such facility to
be expanded to 200
000 bbl. per year with additional equipment.

In
1998
 we purchased certain assets from Carmel Brewing Company
 Inc.
 a California corporation (&ldquo;Carmel Brewing&rdquo;).
We continue to bottle and sell beer under the Carmel Brewing name.

In
2001
 we acquired UBIUK together with UBIUK&rsquo;s wholly-owned subsidiary
 KBEL
 from Inversiones Mirabel
 S.A.
 a Panamanian
corporation
 (&ldquo;Inversiones&rdquo;) in exchange for MBC stock then valued at approximately $5
500
000 (the &ldquo;UBIUK Acquisition&rdquo;).
UBIUK and KBEL primarily market
 sell
 and distribute Kingfisher Premium Lager in the Foreign Territory. Kingfisher Premium Lager
which is the flagship brand of UB Limited
 is a recognized international brand
 with widespread distribution outside our geographic
markets.

We
also acquired the United States brewing and distribution rights for Kingfisher Premium Lager as a result of the UBIUK Acquisition.
We brew Kingfisher Premium Lager in our Saratoga Springs
 New York and Ukiah
 California facilities. We subcontract to HUK the
right to brew Kingfisher Premium Lager for distribution in the Foreign Territory which subcontract expires in October 2018.

In
2005
 United Breweries of America
 BVI
 a British Virgin Islands corporation (&ldquo;UBA-BVI&rdquo;)
 an indirect beneficial owner
of a majority of our outstanding shares
 merged into United Breweries Holdings
 Ltd.
 an Indian public limited company (&ldquo;UBHL&rdquo;).
As a result of the merger of UBA-BVI into UBHL
 UBHL acquired indirect control over approximately 78% of our then outstanding
shares. Dr. Vijay Mallya
 our Chairman of the Board
 is also the Chairman of the board of directors of UBHL.

In
2010
 we purchased certain brand-related assets from Golden West Brewing Company
 a California corporation and Beautiful Brews
Inc.
 a Florida corporation
 including trademarks
 trade names
 and other brand-related assets related to the Butte Creek brands
of organic ales and Honey Amber Rose ale
 respectively. MBC pays royalties based on sales of products which use such assets.

INDUSTRY
OVERVIEW

NORTH
AMERICAN MARKET

We
are a brewer in the craft brewing segment of the United States beer industry. The United States domestic beer market consists
of a number of market categories
 including low-priced
 premium
 super premium
 lite
 import
 and specialty/craft beers. In the
North American Territory
 we compete in the specialty/craft category which the Brewers Association estimates sold approximately
25.8 million barrels in the year 2014. Craft beers are typically all malt
 characterized by their full flavor
 and are usually
produced using methods similar to those of traditional European brews. The domestic beer market is dominated by large domestic
and international brewers. Since our formation in the 1980s
 the rate at which the craft beer segment has grown has fluctuated
over the years. The craft brewing segment is currently growing. The number of craft brewers has increased significantly in the
last two years and the large domestic brewers produce their own fuller-flavored products to compete against craft beers.


    
    


EUROPEAN
MARKET

The
vast majority of our sales in the Foreign Territory are made in the United Kingdom. Sales in the Foreign Territory primarily consist
of sales of Kingfisher Premium Lager. UBIUK has production and distribution rights for Kingfisher Premium Lager in the United
Kingdom and the other European Union countries pursuant to an agreement with UB Limited and sublicense such rights to KBEL.

Within
the Foreign Territory
 our products are primarily distributed through Indian restaurants using restaurant trade distributors.
In addition
 our products are distributed through other retail outlets such as supermarkets
 liquor stores
 and licensed shops
and convenience stores. For more information on our distribution methods and our relationship with HUK
 please refer to the discussion
under the &ldquo;Overview&rdquo; heading above.

OUR
BUSINESS

We
are a pioneering brewer in the specialty craft brewing segment in the United States. We produce high quality ales and lagers in
our own breweries in the United States. We have production and distribution rights to Kingfisher Premium Lager in the European
Union
 Canada and the United States. Generally
 sales are made through distributors.



We
produce a variety of flavorful craft beers by using high quality ingredients in our brewing process. For distribution in the North
American Territory
 we brew ten ales
 one wheat beer
 two lagers
 two pilsners and four stouts
 all on a year-round basis
 and
three seasonal brews. All of these products are brewed at our production facilities in Ukiah
 California
 and Saratoga Springs
New York. The locations of the breweries are well positioned to serve the large markets on the East and West coasts.

In
the Foreign Territory
 we currently distribute Kingfisher Premium Lager. Kingfisher Premium Lager is the leading Indian beer by
sales volume in India and abroad.

Our
principal products are as follows:

RED
TAIL ALE
 a full flavored amber ale
 is our flagship brand. It is available in 12 oz. six-packs and twelve-packs
 half-barrel
kegs
 and 5 gallon kegs.

BLUE
HERON PALE ALE
twelve-packs
 half-barrel kegs
 and 5 gallon kegs.

BLACK
HAWK STOUT
 half-barrel kegs
 and
5 gallon kegs.

EYE
OF THE HAWK SELECT ALE
 half-barrel kegs
 and 5 gallon kegs.

WHITE
HAWK ORIGINAL IPA
six-packs and half-barrel kegs.

KINGFISHER
PREMIUM LAGER
 Kingfisher Premium
Lager is available in 12 oz. six-packs
 22 oz. bottles
 half-barrel kegs
 and 5 gallon kegs as well as on tap in a few pubs and
Indian restaurants. In Canada
 Kingfisher Premium Lager is available in 12 oz. six-packs and 22 oz. bottles. Kingfisher Premium
Lager is available year-round in 330ml and 660ml bottles in multi-packs as well as in a variety of keg sizes in the United Kingdom
Ireland
 and continental Europe. In the United Kingdom
 it is also available on tap in Indian restaurants.


    
    


DISTRIBUTION
METHODS

In
the North American Territory
 our products are sold through wholesale distributors to consumers at supermarkets
 warehouse stores
liquor stores
 taverns and bars
 restaurants and convenience stores.

Our
products are delivered to retail outlets by independent distributors whose principal business is the distribution of beer
 and
in some cases other alcoholic beverages
 and who typically also distribute one or more national beer brands. Together with our
distributors
 we market our products to retail outlets and rely on our distributors to provide regular deliveries
 to maintain
retail shelf space
 and to oversee timely rotation of inventory. We also offer a variety of ales and lagers directly to consumers
at a tasting room attached to the Saratoga Springs brewery in New York and at our ale house in Ukiah
 California.

In
the Foreign Territory
 our products are distributed primarily through Indian restaurants by restaurant trade distributors and
also through supermarkets
 liquor stores
 and licensed shops and convenience stores. The majority of our restaurant sales are
through our on-tap draft installations. KBEL exports Kingfisher Premium Lager
 for the most part pursuant to our distribution
agreement with HUK
 to European markets inside and outside of the United Kingdom
 and our sales growth in those markets typically
correlates with the establishment and proliferation of Indian restaurants in such locations.

Distribution
and retailing of products in Canada involves a wide range and varied degree of government control through provincial liquor boards.
We distribute our products through provincial liquor control boards or independent distributors
 as required in each province.



In
the North American Territory
 we compete against a variety of brewers in the craft beer segment
 including brewpubs
 microbrewers
regional craft brewers
 and craft beer products of major national breweries. There has been a significant increase in the number
of craft brewers in the last two years. Additionally
 the entire craft beer segment competes to some extent with other segments
of the United States beer market
 including major national brands like Budweiser and Miller and imported beers such as Heineken
and Becks.

The
lager market in the United Kingdom is dominated by major international brands such as Stella Artois
 Carling
 Heineken
 Budweiser
and Becks
 in the restaurant and pub sectors and in sales through supermarkets and other retail outlets. Our products are marketed
through Indian and other restaurants
 major supermarket chains
 smaller chains
 and individual stores. In all of these sectors
we face competition from other ethnic and international brands produced by local and large international brewers. We promote Kingfisher
Premium Lager as the worldwide No. 1 selling premium Indian lager. We promote the brand through our significant participation
in events directed at the Indian restaurant trade and volume-driven promotions in supermarkets and retail chains in the United
Kingdom.

In
recent years
 the larger domestic and international brewers have introduced fuller-flavored beers meant to compete with craft
beer offerings. The participation by larger domestic and international brewers increases competition and price sensitivity within
the craft beer segment. Craft brewers compete primarily on product quality
 taste profile
 and consistency.

We
face tough competition in the North American Territory as well as in the Foreign Territory. We compete with other beer and beverage
companies not only for consumer acceptance and loyalty but also for shelf and tap space in retail establishments. We must also
vie for marketing focus by our distributors and their customers
 all of which also distribute and sell other beer and alcoholic
beverage products. Many of our competitors&rsquo; financial and marketing resources and distribution networks are substantially
greater than ours. Moreover
 the introduction of new products by competitors that compete directly with our products
 or that
diminish the importance of our products to retailers or distributors
 may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
cash flows and financial position.


    
    



SOURCES
AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS

Production
of our beverages requires various processed agricultural products
 including malt and hops. We fulfill our commodities requirements
through purchases from various sources
 some through contractual arrangements and others on the open market. In the Foreign Territory
purchases of commodities are currently made by HUK
 which has been brewing our products on a contract basis beginning October
2013. If we are unable to enter into new contracts to purchase materials on commercially reasonable terms
 our results of operations
cash flows and financial position may be materially adversely affected. We believe that the commodity markets will experience
price
 availability and demand fluctuations. The price and availability of raw materials will be determined by
 among other factors
the level of crop production
 weather conditions
 demand
 and government regulations and legislation affecting agriculture.

Our
major suppliers in North America are Great Western Malting Co.
 Yakima
 WA
 and Canada Malting Company
 Montreal
 Canada (malt);
Hop Union LLC
 Yakima
 WA and S.S. Steiner Inc.
 New York
 NY (hops); Gamer Packaging Inc.
 Minneapolis

 and Buckeye Corrugated
 Syracuse
 NY (cartons); Graphic Packaging International
 Vancouver
 WA
and Keystone Paper and Box Company
 Inc.
 South Windsor
 CT (carriers); and DWS Printing Associates
 Bay Shore
 NY (labels).

Our
major supplier for the Foreign Territory is HUK
 which supplies on a contract basis all of our products that are sold in the Foreign
Territory. We do not directly purchase any agricultural commodities or other products for use in the Foreign Territory.

DEPENDENCE
ON MAJOR CUSTOMERS

Sales
to our top five customers in 2015 totaled $4
854
000 (approximately 15% of our sales)
 as compared to sales to our top five customers
in 2014 which totaled $5
466
700 (approximately 16% of our sales).

No
individual customer accounted for more than 5% of our total sales during fiscal year 2015 or 2014.



Our
product sales are seasonal
 with the first and fourth quarters historically being the slowest and the rest of the year typically
having stronger sales. Sales volume may be affected by weather. Accordingly
 our results for any individual quarter may not be
indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.

Sales
and Marketing

We
market our products through various promotional programs with our distributors and wholesalers. Our sales and marketing staff
offer support to the wholesalers and retailers by educating them about our products. Our products are promoted at local art
 music
and food festivals
 and restaurants and pubs. We operate a tasting room at our Saratoga Springs brewery and our ale house in Ukiah
California. We utilize signs
 tap handles
 coasters
 logo glassware and posters to promote our products in bars
 pubs and restaurants.

We
participate in various consumer promotion programs
 primarily price discounts. We occasionally advertise our products in print
media.

LICENSE
AND ROYALTY AGREEMENTS

UBIUK
holds the exclusive brewing and distribution rights for Kingfisher Premium Lager in the United Kingdom
 Ireland
 continental Europe
and Canada through a licensing agreement with UB Limited. UBIUK licenses such rights to KBEL. The licensing agreement between
UBIUK and UB Limited is currently scheduled to expire in October 2018.

In
July 2001
 we entered into the Kingfisher Trademark and Trade Name License Agreement with Kingfisher America
 Inc.
 pursuant to
which we obtained a royalty-free
 exclusive license to use the Kingfisher trademark and trade name in connection with the brewing
and distribution of beer in the United States. This agreement is scheduled to expire in October 2018.

Since
October 2013
 KBEL has licensed to HUK the exclusive right to brew
 keg
 bottle
 can
 label
 and package all beers and related
products sold under the Kingfisher trademark in the United Kingdom
 Ireland
 and continental Europe. In exchange for certain exclusive
resale rights
 HUK pays a royalty fee to KBEL for certain sales. The price KBEL pays to HUK for brewing Kingfisher Premium Lager
for distribution in the United Kingdom is set by a formula which varies according to the applicable duty on Kingfisher Premium
Lager and other factors. (For additional information see &ldquo;Item 13. &mdash; Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
- Brewing Agreement&rdquo;.) Under its terms
 this agreement will expire in October 2018.

GOVERNMENTAL
REGULATION

Our
North American Territory operations are subject to licensing by local
 state and federal governments
 as well as to regulation
by a variety of state and local agencies. We are licensed to manufacture and sell beer by the Departments of Alcoholic Beverage
Control in California and New York. A federal permit from the United States Treasury Department
 Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade
Bureau (the &ldquo;TTB&rdquo;) (formerly the Bureau of Alcohol
 Tobacco
 and Firearms) allows us to manufacture fermented malt
beverages. To keep these licenses and permits in force we must pay annual fees and submit timely production reports and excise
tax returns. We must give these regulatory agencies prompt notice of any changes in our operations
 ownership
 or company structure.
The TTB must also approve all product labels
 which must include an alcohol use warning. These agencies require that individuals
owning equity securities totaling in the aggregate 10% or more of our outstanding securities be investigated as to their suitability
of character. Our production operations must also comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration&rsquo;s workplace
safety and worker health regulations and comparable state laws. Management believes that we are presently in compliance with the
aforementioned laws and regulations. In addition
 we have implemented our own voluntary safety program. Our Ukiah ale house is
regulated by the Mendocino County Health Department
 which requires an annual permit and conducts spot inspections to monitor
compliance with applicable health codes. In Canada
 provincial governments regulate the beer industry
 particularly the pricing
mark-up
 container management
 sale
 distribution and advertising of beer. Distribution and retailing of products in Canada involves
a wide range and varied degree of government control through provincial liquor boards. We distribute our products in Canada through
provincial liquor control boards or independent distributors
 as per the applicable regulation for each province.

In
the United States
 for brewers producing less than 2
000
000 barrels (or bbl.) per year
 the federal excise tax rate is $7.00
per bbl. for up to 60
000 bbl. per year and $18.00 per bbl. for over 60
000 bbl. The California excise tax rate is $6.20 per bbl.
The State of New York presently imposes on brewers an excise tax of $4.34 per bbl.


    
    



Our
operations in the Foreign Territory are subject to regulation by United Kingdom and European laws
 as well as by the laws of various
individual countries in which our products are distributed. Due to the current contract brewing arrangement in the Foreign Territory
HUK
 rather than the Company
 is subject to various laws of the European countries (other than Germany) regarding production
bottling
 packaging
 and labeling. Our products in Germany are manufactured and distributed by contractual partners in Germany
who are subject to such laws in Germany.

COMPLIANCE
WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

We
are subject to various federal
 state
 and local environmental laws which regulate the use
 storage
 handling
 and disposal of
various substances. We have not received any notice from any governmental agency relating to our violation of any applicable environmental
law.

Our
waste products consist of process water
 spent grains
 hops
 glass and cardboard. We have instituted a recycling program for our
office paper
 newspapers
 magazines
 glass
 and cardboard at minimal cost to us. We sell or give away our spent grain to local
cattle ranchers.

.
We built our own wastewater treatment plant for the Ukiah facility. As a result
 we have reduced our sewer hook-up fees at that
location. If our discharge exceeds 55
000 gallons per day
 which Management does not expect to occur until annual capacity exceeds
100
000 bbl.
 we may be required to pay additional fees. The approximate operating costs of the plant are between $6
000 and $10
000
per month
 which may increase with increased production. We have contracted to have the liquid sediment that remains from the
treated wastewater trucked to a local composting facility at a cost of between $4
500 and $5
500 per month. We obtained a Mendocino
County Air Quality Control Permit to operate a natural gas fired boiler in Ukiah; this permit is valid until August 30
 2016.
Management expects this permit to be renewed each year.

Saratoga
Springs
 cardboard
 glass
 and liquid waste. We have instituted a recycling
program for cardboard
 office paper and glass at minimal cost to us. Spent grain is given away to local cattle dairy farms free
of charge. We pay approximately $2
500 per month in sewer fees for liquid waste. We follow and operate under the rules and regulations
of the New York Department of Environmental Conservation for Air Pollution Control.

Various
states in which we sell our products
 including California and New York
 have adopted certain restrictive packaging laws and regulations
for beverages. These laws require deposits on packages. Such laws have not had a significant effect on our sales. The adoption
of similar legislation by Congress
 a substantial number of states or additional local jurisdictions
 might require us to incur
significant capital expenditures for compliance. We believe we are in compliance with all applicable Canadian laws and regulations.

In
general
 European packaging regulations are covered by specifications provided by the European Union; we believe we are in compliance
with such specifications.

Dram
Shop Laws

The
serving of alcoholic beverages to a person known to be intoxicated may
 under certain circumstances
 result in the server being
held liable to third parties for injuries caused by the intoxicated customer. Our brewpub and tasting room have limited hours
and our employees have knowledge of this issue. Large awards in excess of
 or not covered by
 our insurance coverage could adversely
affect our financial condition.



As
of December 31
 2015
 MBC had 48 full-time and 12 part-time employees in the United States
 including 9 in management and administration
39 in brewing and production operations
 4 in retail and tavern operations and 8 in sales and marketing positions. In England
UBIUK and KBEL together had 29 full-time employees as of December 31
 2015
 including 18 in sales and marketing and 11 in managerial
and administrative positions. Management believes that our relationship with our employees is generally good.


    
    



Approximately
15 employees currently engaged in brewing
 bottling
 warehousing
 and shipping at the Ukiah brewery are represented by Teamsters
Local No. 896
 International Brotherhood of Teamsters
 AFL-CIO (the &ldquo;Union&rdquo;). Under our collective bargaining agreement
with the Union
 all such 15 employees&rsquo; positions must be held and filled by members of the Union. The collective bargaining
agreement expires on July 31
 2018.

RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT

We
have not spent a material amount during the last two fiscal years on research and development activities or on customer-sponsored
research activities relating to the development of new products
 services or techniques
 or the improvement of existing products
services or techniques.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS.

In
addition to the other information about risks in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 described below are the risks and uncertainties
that we believe are most likely to be material to our business and results of operations. Our business operations and results
may also be adversely affected by additional risks and uncertainties not presently known
 or which we currently deem immaterial
or which are applicable in general to the industries in which we compete or to the economies in which we sell our products. Any
of the following risks or uncertainties might cause our business
 financial condition
 results of operations or cash flows to
suffer.

LACK
OF PROFITABLE OPERATIONS: We have incurred a net loss in the North American Territory since 2012. From 2005 to 2011
 operations
in the Foreign Territory resulted in a net loss. We have not incurred a net loss in the Foreign Territory since then. We believe
our losses are attributable to low sales volume and high operating expenses. Our business is also subject to certain fixed and
semi-variable operating costs
 which
 when combined with the difference between current levels of production and maximum production
capacity in the North American Territory
 may cause our gross margins to be sensitive to small increases or decreases in sales
volume. We may not be able to offset such increased expenses with comparable price increases in our products
 which could also
impact our gross margins. We contract brew products for other brewers in an effort to use our capacity. We may not be successful
in our efforts to increase sales volume of our brands or contract brands and capacity utilization rates. It is uncertain when
if at all
 our operations in the North American Territory will become profitable once again. Future operating losses may have
a material adverse effect on our cash flows and financial position.

LIQUIDITY:
Low utilization of the production capacity at our Ukiah and Saratoga Springs facilities and continued losses from our North American
Territory operations place demands on our working capital. We have loans
 lines of credit
 other credit facilities
 and lease
obligations with various creditors. We may find it difficult to continue our operations
 at least in the short term
 if any of
the following occur: a breach of any loan provision by us that leads to our default
 an inability of any lender to continue to
offer or renew credit facilities
 the refusal of any lenders to whom we presently are in default to continue to provide credit
to us
 our inability to refinance credit facilities when and as they become due
 or an attempt by one of our creditors to exercise
its rights to certain of our tangible or intangible assets which have been used as collateral or which have been pledged as security
for our obligations.

We
rely on short and long-term debt to meet our working capital needs. As described in the &ldquo;Description of Our Indebtedness&rdquo;
section of Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 the terms of the Company&rsquo;s
loan agreement (&ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) with MB Financial Bank
 successor in interest to Cole Taylor Bank
 an Illinois banking
corporation (&ldquo;MB Financial&rdquo;)
 require that we meet certain financial covenants. Failure to meet the covenants is an
event of default under the Agreement. On September 18
 2013
 MBC and Releta received a notice (the &ldquo;Default Notice&rdquo;)
from MB Financial regarding its intention to exercise certain rights with respect to events of default of the Company pursuant
to the Agreement. Under the Agreement
 upon the occurrence of an event of default
 all of MBC&rsquo;s and Releta&rsquo;s obligations
under the Agreement may
 at the option of MB Financial
 be declared
 and immediately shall become
 due and payable
 without notice
of any kind. MB Financial has elected under the Agreement to charge a default interest rate equal to two percent (2%) per annum
in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable under the Agreement effective September 1
 2013.


    
    


On
April 18
 2014
 MBC and Releta received a second notice (the &ldquo;Second Default Notice&rdquo;) from Lender regarding its intention
to exercise certain rights with respect to events of default of the Company pursuant to the Agreement. The Second Default Notice
required MBC and Releta to engage a consultant to perform a viability analysis and prepare a revised projection for 2014.

Effective
August 20
 2014
 pursuant to a notice to MBC and Releta dated August 18
 2014 (the &ldquo;Third Default Notice&rdquo;) which referred
to MBC&rsquo;s and Releta&rsquo;s continued failure to meet the required fixed charge coverage ratio and the tangible net worth
requirement
 MB Financial notified MBC and Releta that it would reduce the advance rate for (i) eligible finished goods and raw
material inventory and (ii) eligible work-in progress inventory by 2% each month. The advance rates are used in the calculation
of the borrowing base of each of MBC and Releta
 which is used in the determination of the amount available to each of MBC and
Releta pursuant to the revolving facility. Under the terms of the Agreement
 if such availability is less than $0
 or if certain
components of the borrowing base of each of MBC and Releta fall below certain limits in relation to outstanding revolving loans
such difference shall be immediately due and payable.

On
January 21
 2015
 MBC
 Releta
 and Lender entered into a Second Amendment (the &ldquo;Second Amendment&rdquo;) to the Agreement
dated June 23
 2011
 as previously amended on March 29
 2013.

The
Second Amendment reduces the maximum amount of the Company&rsquo;s revolving line of credit with MB Financial (the &ldquo;Revolver&rdquo;)from
$4
119
000 to $2
500
000. The Second Amendment also changes the definition of borrowing base (including by lowering certain advance
rates) such that the calculation of the borrowing base will result in a lower number than it would have if calculated prior to
the effectiveness of the Second Amendment. The borrowing base is used in the determination of the amount available to each borrower
(&ldquo;Borrower&rdquo;) pursuant to the Revolver. Pursuant to the Agreement
 if such availability is less than $0
 or if certain
components of the borrowing base fall below certain limits in relation to outstanding revolving loans
 such difference shall be
immediately due and payable.

The
Second Amendment reduced the advance rate for (i) eligible finished goods and raw material inventory and (ii) eligible work-in
progress inventory by two percent (2%) and continues to reduce each by an additional two percent (2%) on the 20th day of each
month thereafter. The advance rates are used in the calculation of the borrowing base of each Borrower
 which is used in the determination
of the amount available to each Borrower pursuant to the Revolver. As stated above
 if such availability is less than $0
 or if
certain components of the borrowing base fall below certain limits in relation to outstanding revolving loans
 such difference
shall be immediately due and payable.

MB
Financial has not waived the events of default described in the Default Notice
 the Second Default Notice or the Third Default
Notice and has reserved all other available rights and remedies under the Agreement
 certain other related documents and applicable
law. MB Financial could declare the full amount owed under the Agreement due and payable at any time for any reason or no reason.
The Company has not received any further notice or other communication from MB Financial that it intends to exercise any of the
remedies available to it under the Agreement in connection with the events of default. However
 the Agreement expires on June
23
 2016. The exercise of additional remedies by MB Financial or its failure to renew the Agreement may have a material adverse
effect on the Company&rsquo;s financial condition and the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue to operate. If it becomes necessary
for MBC and Releta to seek additional financing
 there is no guarantee that MBC and Releta will be able to obtain such financing
on terms favorable to the Company or on any terms.

Rates
of interest on our credit facilities are variable based on the prime lending rates in the United States and the United Kingdom.
Any increase in the prime lending rates would increase our interest expense and could have a material adverse effect on our financial
position and results of operations.

The
 Maintaining our facilities or introducing new
products or packaging may require incremental capital expenditures; however
 per the terms of the Agreement
 our capital expenditures
will be limited to specified amounts (based on a formula). If the capital expenditures necessary to maintain our facilities or
bring new products or packaging to market are greater than the amounts to which we are limited by this arrangement
 our ability
to maintain or increase sales growth could be impaired
 which could materially adversely affect our business.

The
Company received a letter dated November 11
 2013
 from UBHL expressing its willingness to commit to invest $2
000
000 in the
Company in four installments to be paid every six months over a two year period. The letter did not state definitive terms for
the proposed investment. Such additional investment would be based on a business plan to be provided by the Company. We provided
a business plan in February 2015 and requested additional investment from UBHL. If we are unable to come to a final agreement
with UBHL on the terms of the proposed investment or UBHL does not agree to provide such additional investment
 it may result
in a material adverse effect on our financial position and on our ability to continue operations


    
    



On
March 5
 2015
 UBHL
 MBC&rsquo;s indirect majority shareholder
 issued a letter of comfort (the &ldquo;Letter of Comfort&rdquo;)
to the Company&rsquo;s accountants
 to confirm that UBHL had agreed to provide funding on an as needed basis to ensure that the
company is able to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. The Letter of Comfort does not specify either the
terms of UBHL&rsquo;s support
 or a maximum dollar limit. UBHL&rsquo;s financial support is contingent upon compliance with any
applicable exchange control requirements
 other applicable laws and regulations relating to the transfer of funds from India and
is not a legally binding guarantee. The Letter of Comfort does not specify any time limit for extending support. If it becomes
necessary to seek UBHL&rsquo;s financial assistance under the Letter of Comfort and UBHL is either unable or unwilling to provide
such financial assistance
 it may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position and on our ability to continue
operations.

On
December 9
 2015
 the Company engaged Gordian Group
 LLC (&ldquo;Gordian Group&rdquo;) to serve as the Company&rsquo;s exclusive
investment banker to assist the Company in evaluating
 exploring and
 if deemed appropriate by the Company
 pursuing and implementing
certain strategic and financial options and transactions that may be available to the Company
 including a possible debt or equity
capital financing
 merger
 consolidation
 joint venture or other business combination involving
 or sale of substantially all
or a material portion of the assets (outside of the ordinary course of business) or outstanding securities of
 the Company and/or
its subsidiaries
 and/or the acquisition of substantially all or a material portion of the assets or outstanding securities of
another entity (each
 a &ldquo;Financial Transaction&rdquo;). Gordian Group is a New York-based independent investment banking
firm. While the Company has commenced evaluating its available options
 no conclusion as to any specific option or transaction
has been reached
 nor has any specific timetable been fixed for this effort
 and there can be no assurance that any strategic
or financial option or transaction will be presented
 implemented or consummated. The Company intends to use proceeds of any Financial
Transaction to
 among other things
 repay the amount owed to Lender when it becomes due.

If
we are unable to find any source of funds
 it may result in a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations. For
example
 MB Financial may seek to satisfy any outstanding obligations through recourse against the applicable pledged collateral
which may include our real property
 fixed assets and current assets. The loss of any material pledged asset would likely have
a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. If we are unable to renew the Agreement or find
an alternate source of funds
 this may result in a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations.

As
described in &ldquo;Item 7. Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &ndash;
Liquidity and Capital Resources &ndash; Other Loans and Credit Facilities&rdquo;
 we have a line of credit with Royal Bank of
Scotland Commercial Services Limited (&ldquo;RBS&rdquo;)
 which expires on May 31
 2016. We have engaged in discussions with a
bank which provided an indicative offer to provide a replacement for the RBS line of credit.

COMPETITION:
We face intense competition in both our North American Territory and in our Foreign Territory from competitors in the beer market
and producers of wine and spirits. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial and marketing resources and
more extensive distribution networks than we do. In addition
 the introduction of new products by existing competitors or new
entrants into the market may impact our market share. Moreover
 consumer preference and consumer trends may result in a decrease
in demand for our products which could also have an impact on our results of operations.

RAW
MATERIALS: We are dependent on a limited number of suppliers
 and in some instances on a sole supplier
 for the majority of the
raw materials and packaging materials used in our North American operations. As a result
 an interruption in the supply chain
or refusal of any supplier to provide materials on credit might have an adverse effect on our operations if we were unable to
find an alternative supplier at a comparable price. Unfavorable weather conditions might impact the output of crops necessary
to brew our products which might
 in turn
 affect our supply chain and increase our costs. We may not be in a position to pass
the entire amount of any cost increase to our customers which may have an adverse effect on our operations.

WATER:
Our brewing operations use significant amount of water. Due to drought conditions in California
 there may be a shortage of water.
Any shortage or restricted supply of water will have a material adverse impact on our ability to brew the product and an adverse
effect on our results of operations
 cash flows and financial position.


    
    



DEPENDENCY
ON CONTRACT BREWING ARRANGEMENTS: We have entered into short term non-binding arrangements with several brewers to brew and package
their brands at our brewing facilities
 predominantly at our Saratoga Springs
 New York facility. Approximately 33% of our beer
volume in the North American Territory for fiscal year 2015 was comprised of sales made under such contract brewing arrangements.
There is no certainty that our existing arrangements will be extended in the future or that we will be able to enter into other
new arrangements. Any significant variation in contract brewing arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations
 cash flows and financial position.

DEPENDENCY
ON DISTRIBUTORS: We sell beer (which is physically distributed by HUK in the Foreign Territory and by another contractual partner
in Germany) to independent beer distributors for distribution to retailers. Although the Company currently has arrangements sufficient
to meet our current needs with its wholesale distributors to distribute the products
 any sustained growth would require us to
maintain such relationships and possibly enter into agreements with additional distributors. Changes in control or ownership of
the current distribution network could lead to less support of our products. No assurance can be given that we will be able to
maintain or secure additional distributors on terms favorable to us. Our ability to maintain existing distribution arrangements
may be adversely affected by the fact that many of our distributors are reliant on one of the major beer producers for a large
percentage of their revenue and
 therefore
 they may be influenced by such producers. If our existing distribution agreements
are terminated
 we may not be able to enter into new distribution agreements on substantially similar terms
 which may result
in an increase in the costs of distribution.

ARRANGEMENT
WITH HUK: KBEL entered into a brewing agreement that grants HUK the exclusive right to brew and package all beers sold under the
Kingfisher trademark in the United Kingdom
 and to distribute such products elsewhere in the Foreign Territory. Any interruption
of the brewing
 packaging or distribution of our products by HUK for any reason is likely to have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations
 cash flows and financial position. In addition
 any failure of HUK to comply with any applicable laws
or regulations may have an adverse impact on us.

GROSS
 We anticipate that our future gross margins
will fluctuate and may even decline as a result of many factors
 including disproportionate depreciation and other fixed and semi-variable
operating costs
 and the level of production at our breweries in relation to current production capacity. Our sales volume is
much lower than our brewing and packaging capacities
 leading to underutilization (See &ldquo;Item 2 &ndash; Properties&rdquo;
below). Both of our brewing facilities incur maintenance and other costs on a level consistent with their maximum capacity rather
than with their current utilization levels. Our high level of fixed and semi-variable operating costs causes gross margin to be
especially sensitive to relatively small increases or decreases in sales volume. Other factors that could affect cost of sales
include changes in freight charges
 the availability and prices of raw materials and packaging materials
 the mix between draft
and bottled product sales
 and federal or state excise taxes and levies. Our inability to align costs and utilization rates affects
our capital
 liquidity
 and management resources. Failure to adequately align such costs and utilization rates may have a material
adverse effect on our business
 financial condition
 and results of operations.

MATERIAL
CONTRACT FOR THE SUPPLY OF KEGS: We have entered into an exclusive Keg Management Agreement with MicroStar Keg Management LLC
(&ldquo;MicroStar&rdquo;) which expires in September 2019. Under the terms of the agreement with MicroStar
 we receive our entire
supply of kegs exclusively from MicroStar. If the agreement is terminated by either party
 we are required to purchase from MicroStar
four times the average monthly keg usage for the preceding six-month period. We may need additional funds to purchase those kegs.
An interruption in the supply of kegs or
 in the case of termination of the agreement
 our failure to obtain the necessary funding
to facilitate such purchases could have a material adverse effect on our business
 results of operations
 cash flows or financial
position.

SEASONALITY:
Sales of craft beer products in the United States and beer sales in the United Kingdom are somewhat seasonal
 with the winter
months historically being the slowest and the summer months generating stronger sales. Our sales volume may also be affected by
weather conditions. Therefore
 the results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full
fiscal year. If an adverse event such as a regional economic downturn or poor weather conditions should occur during the second
and third quarters
 the adverse impact to our revenues would likely be greater as a result of the seasonal business.


    
    


REGULATION
AND TAXATION: The manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages is a business that is highly regulated and taxed at the federal
state and local levels. Our operations may be subject to more restrictive regulations and higher taxation compared to non-alcohol
related businesses. For instance
 brewery and wholesale operations require various federal
 state and local licenses
 permits
and approvals. In addition
 some states prohibit wholesalers and retailers from holding an interest in any supplier such as the
Company. Violation of such regulations can result in the loss or revocation of existing licenses by the wholesaler
 retailer and/or
supplier. The loss or revocation of any existing licenses
 permits or approvals
 failure to obtain any necessary additional or
new licenses
 permits or approvals
 or the failure to obtain approval for the transfer of any existing permits or licenses
 could
have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. Because of the many and various licensing and permitting
requirements and the complexity of complying with all such requirements
 there is a risk that one or more regulatory authorities
could determine that we have not complied with applicable licensing or permitting regulations
 paid the appropriate excise taxes
or maintained the approvals necessary to conduct business within their respective jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that
any such regulatory action would not have a material adverse effect upon us or our operating results.

Various
jurisdictions frequently propose increasing the federal and/or state excise tax on alcoholic beverages
 or certain types of alcoholic
beverages such as flavored malt beverages
 either to increase revenues
 or discourage purchase by underage drinkers. If adopted
these measures could affect some or all of our products. If federal or state excise taxes are increased
 we may have to raise
prices to maintain present profit margins which may have an impact on our sales volume. Higher taxes on beer may reduce the overall
demand
 thus negatively impacting sales of our products. Recently
 states have been reviewing the tax treatment for flavored malt
beverages. A change in such treatment could result in increased costs for the Company and decreased sales.

Further
federal or state regulation may be forthcoming that could limit distribution and sales of alcohol products. Such regulation might
reduce our ability to sell our products at retail and at wholesale and could severely impact our business.

CHANGE
IN PUBLIC ATTITUDE AND DRINKING PREFERENCES: There is public concern over alcohol-related social problems
 including drunk driving
underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol
 including alcoholism. This may adversely affect consumption
of alcoholic beverages. Consumer drinking preferences may also change due to the availability of an increasing variety of products
in the craft brew segment. Any change in government regulation or shift in consumer preference may have an adverse impact on our
operations. Consumer demand for luxury items
 including craft beer
 is sensitive to downturns in the economy and the corresponding
impact on discretionary spending. Changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors
such as perceived or actual general economic conditions
 job losses and the resultant rising unemployment rate
 perceived or actual
decreases in disposable consumer income and wealth and changes in consumer confidence in the economy could significantly reduce
customer demand for craft beer in general
 and our products
 specifically. Furthermore
 any of these factors may cause consumers
to substitute our products with the fuller-flavored national brands or other more affordable alternatives. In either event
 decreased
consumer demand would likely have a significant negative impact on our operating results.

ADVERTISING
AND MARKETING EFFORTS: The sales and marketing programs we use to generate demand for our products may be unsuccessful
In the future this could lead us to lower the prices that we charge for our products
 depending on competitive factors in our
various markets. To increase demand for our products
 we have participated in price promotions with our wholesalers and retail
customers in most of our markets. The number of markets in which we participate in price promotions and the frequency of such
promotions may change depending upon market conditions. There can be no assurance that our price promotions will be successful
in increasing demand for our products. If consumers were unwilling to accept our products or if general consumer trends caused
a decrease in the demand for beer
 including craft beer
 it would adversely impact our sales and results of operations. If the
flavored alcohol beverage market
 the wine market
 or the spirits market continues to grow
 this could draw consumers away from
our products and have an adverse effect on sales and results of operations. Furthermore
 if beer consumption in general were to
fall out of favor among consumers
 or if the beer industry were subjected to significant additional governmental regulation
 our
operations could be adversely affected.

INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS: We rely upon the capacity
 reliability and security of our information technology
 or IT
 systems across all
of our major business functions
 including manufacturing
 retail
 financial and administrative functions. We also rely on systems
owned and operated by third party business vendors to process payroll for our employees. Our business requires us to use and store
customer
 employee and business partner personally identifiable information
 which we refer to as PII. This may include names
addresses
 phone numbers
 email addresses and contact preferences.


    
    



Information
technology helps us operate efficiently and produce our financial statements. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the
resources necessary to sustain our technology infrastructure
 we could be subject to transaction errors
 processing inefficiencies
business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach. Any inefficiency in our data management
systems could materially impair our ability to effectively plan
 forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable
laws and regulations. We also face the challenge of supporting our older data management systems and implementing upgrades when
necessary. Any impairment to our data management systems could materially and adversely affect our financial condition
 results
of operations
 cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results.

We
require user names and passwords in order to access our information technology systems. We also use encryption and authentication
technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data. We rely on security measures implemented by third party vendors to
protect our PII. These security measures may be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches
 employee error
 malfeasance
faulty password management or other irregularities
 and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to our data or accounts.

We
are not aware of any material cyber-attack on our information technology systems. The costs to timely detect and eliminate or
alleviate network security problems
 bugs
 viruses
 worms
 malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant
and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in unexpected interruptions
 delays
 or cessation
of service
 and may harm our business operations. Moreover
 if a computer security breach affects our systems or results in the
unauthorized release of PII
 our reputation and brand could be materially damaged and use of our products and services could decrease.
We would also be exposed to risks of loss
 litigation and potential liability
 which could result in a material adverse effect
on our business
 results of operations and financial condition. We do not have specific insurance coverage against risks related
to cyber incidents.

INSURANCE:
We may experience material losses in excess of
 or not covered by
 our insurance coverage. We believe that we have a reasonable
amount of insurance coverage for a business of our size and type. There are
 however
 certain types of catastrophic losses that
are not generally insured because it is not economically feasible to insure against such losses. Should an uninsured loss or a
loss in excess of insured limits occur
 such loss could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

LITIGATION:
In the future we may be subject to litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.
At any given time
 we are subject to claims and actions incidental to the operation of our business. The outcome of these proceedings
cannot be predicted. If a plaintiff were successful in a claim against our Company
 we could be faced with the payment of a material
sum of money. If this were to occur
 it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.

COMMON
STOCK PRICE: The market for our Common Stock is limited
 sporadic and highly volatile. Since our shares do not qualify to trade
on any national securities exchange
 the only market currently available

DIVIDENDS:
We have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
Instead
 we will likely retain future earnings for reinvestment in our business.

BREWING
FACILITIES

We
own nine acres of land in Ukiah
 California on which our Ukiah brewery is located. Management believes that this facility is adequate
for our current capacity and also provides space for future expansion. MB Financial currently holds a deed of trust on this property
in connection with a loan advanced to us. (See &ldquo;Item 7. &ndash; Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations &ndash; Description of our Indebtedness &ndash; MB Financial Facility&rdquo;). The principal
amount outstanding on the loan as of December 31
 2015 was $2
276
200.

We
have estimated the life of the Ukiah brewery at 40 years and depreciate the cost of the building on a straight-line method over
its anticipated life. We do not depreciate the cost of the land. Our assessed value on the Ukiah facility is approximately $10
664
700.
Various other assets incorporated in this facility are being depreciated
 on a straight-line basis
 at rates of between 5 to 40
years. Property taxes are currently assessed on the Ukiah property (including machinery and equipment) at a rate of approximately
1.16%
 for an annual tax of $123
200.

We
also lease 3.66 acres in Saratoga Springs
 New York
 on which the Ten Springs brewery facilities are located. In 2009
 we leased
additional warehouse space and entered into a new lease. The current term of this lease expires on July 2019
 with an option to
extend the lease for two successive terms of five years each
 provided that the lease is not in default.

Based
on current product mix
 the brewery in Ukiah
 California has a current annual cellar capacity of approximately 65
000 bbl
 and
the brewery at Saratoga Springs
 New York currently has an annual cellar capacity of approximately 55
000 bbl. per year. The Ukiah
and Saratoga Springs breweries have annual packaging capacity of approximately 100
000 bbl. each on a single shift basis
 and
each brewery has annual brewing capacity of approximately 200
000 bbl. (See &ldquo;Item 1A &ndash; Risk Factors &ndash; Gross
Margins&rdquo; above.)

ALE
HOUSE

We
have leased a 2
500 square foot building in Ukiah
 California where our ale house and merchandise store is located.

OFFICE
SPACE

KBEL
has leased approximately 1
400 square feet of office space in Maidstone
 Kent
 in England. We do not own or lease any other material
properties in Europe.

MACHINERY
AND EQUIPMENT

We
lease certain equipment and vehicles under capital and operating leases which expire at varying times. Additionally
 we lease
equipment and vehicles under various other leases. As these leases expire
 it is anticipated that
 in accordance with our current
practices
 the equipment will be acquired
 the vehicles will be surrendered
 and we may enter into new vehicle leases.

We
consider our land
 buildings
 improvements
 and equipment to be well maintained
 in good condition
 and adequate to meet the operating
demands placed upon them. In the opinion of Management
 all of these properties are adequately covered by insurance.

3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

On
September 26
 2014
 The New Buffalo Brewing Co.
 Inc. (&ldquo;NBB&rdquo;) initiated an action against Releta in the Supreme Court
of the State of New York for the County of Erie to recover damages for alleged breaches of a Brewing Production Agreement between
NBB and Releta dated September 6
 2013 (the &ldquo;Brewing Production Agreement&rdquo;)
 as well as for a declaration rescinding
and nullifying the Brewing Production Agreement
 and
 in case of Releta&rsquo;s failure to answer or appear
 damages resulting
from the alleged breaches
 rescission of the Brewing Production Agreement
 attorneys&rsquo; fees and any other relief deemed proper
by the court. In a demand letter to Releta dated October 16
 2014
 NBB demanded payment of the sum of $500
000. The Company has
engaged a law firm in New York to respond. As of the date of this Annual Report
 this litigation remains ongoing.

On
June 3
 2015
 IAE International Aero Engines AG (&ldquo;IAE&rdquo;) served the Company with a complaint (the &ldquo;Complaint&rdquo;)
filed in Marin County Superior Court
 California (the &ldquo;Court&rdquo;)
 which requests
 among other things
 (i) that the Court
recognize and enforce a foreign judgment against an Indian corporate entity (which is an affiliate of the Company)
 the alleged
judgment debtor
 and (ii) that such judgment be made enforceable against any assets of the Company (and of the other defendants)
that are located in California
 on the alleged ground that the Company (along with the other defendants) is an &ldquo;alter ego&rdquo;
of the alleged judgment debtor. Along with the Complaint
 IAE also served the Company with an ex parte application for a right
to attach order and a writ of attachment
 and
 in the alternative
 a temporary protective order (collectively
 the &ldquo;ex parte
application&rdquo;) to
 among other things
 stop the Company from making certain transfers to related parties other than in the
ordinary of business.

The
ex parte application came up for hearing before the Court on June 5
 2015. At the conclusion of the continued hearing on June
9
 2015
 the Court denied the ex parte application for a writ of attachment and dissolved the limited temporary protective order.
No trial date has been set
 and the matter is ongoing.

The
Company believes that the allegations in the Complaint are without merit and will continue to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.

As
discussed in the Company&rsquo;s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 9
 2015
 the Company has informed MB Financial about
the allegations set forth in the Complaint and the ex parte application and
 as of the date of this Annual Report
 the Company
has not received any notice or other communication from MB Financial that it intends to exercise any of the remedies available
to it under the Agreement in connection therewith.

The
Company is involved from time to time in other claims
 proceedings and litigation arising in the normal course of business. The
Company believes that
 to the extent that any pending or threatened litigation involving the Company or its properties exists
such litigation will not likely have any material adverse effect on the Company&rsquo;s financial condition or results of operations.

MARKET
INFORMATION

Our
 tier of the OTC Markets under the symbol &ldquo;MENB&rdquo;. The market
for our Common Stock is limited
 sporadic and highly volatile. Since our shares do not qualify to trade on any national securities
exchange
 the only market currently available
 to the extent any trading occurs
 will continue to be the &ldquo;bulletin boards&rdquo;.
It is possible that no active public market with significant liquidity will ever develop. Thus
 investors run the risk of never
being able to sell their shares.

The
table below sets forth
 for the fiscal quarters indicated
 the quoted high and low bid prices for our Common Stock
 as reported
 tier of the OTC Markets. The information listed below reflects inter-dealer bids
 without retail mark-up
mark-down
 or commission

We
had approximately 2
139 holders of our Common Stock of record as of March 15
 2016.



Historically
we have not paid any dividends. We anticipate that for the foreseeable future
 all earnings
 if any
 will be retained for the
operation and expansion of our business and that we will not pay cash dividends. The payment of dividends
 if any
 in the future
will be at the discretion of MBC&rsquo;s board of directors
 which we refer to in this Annual Report as the Board
 and will depend
upon
 among other things
 future earnings
 capital requirements
 restrictions in future financing agreements
 the general financial
condition of the Company and general business conditions. Our Agreement with MB Financial provides that we may not declare or
pay any dividend or other distribution on our Common Stock (other than a stock dividend)
 or purchase or redeem any Common Stock
without MB Financial&rsquo;s prior written consent. Management anticipates that similar restrictions will remain in effect for
as long as we have significant bank financing.

The
holders of our 227
600 outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock (which are not listed for trading on any market
 or to our
knowledge quoted on any bulletin board or other public quotation system) are entitled to aggregate cash dividends and liquidation
proceeds of $1.00 per share before any dividend may be paid with respect to the Common Stock.

SECURITIES

NET
SALES

As
used herein
 the term &ldquo;net sales&rdquo; refers to gross sales less excise taxes. Overall net sales for fiscal year 2015
were $31
183
700 a decrease of $2
855
500 or 8% as compared to $34
039
200 in fiscal year 2014 due to lower sales volume.

NORTH
AMERICAN TERRITORY OPERATIONS: Net sales in the North American Territory totaled $11
364
100 in fiscal year 2015
 compared to
$12
253
800 for fiscal year 2014
 representing a decrease of $889
700 or 7%. Sales of beer for fiscal year 2015 decreased by 4
900
barrels to 56
000 barrels
 a decrease of 8%
 as compared to 60
900 barrels in fiscal year 2014. This decrease was due to (i) a
decrease in sales of brands we own by 7
200 barrels due to increased competition offset by an increase in sales of contract brands
by 2
300 barrels because of new contracts secured in 2015. We continue to solicit opportunities to enter into non-binding contract
brewing arrangements to address the low production capacity utilization rates in our Ukiah and Saratoga Springs brewing facilities
and anticipate that fluctuations in the availability of such contract brewing arrangements will continue to impact our net sales
in the North American Territory.

FOREIGN
TERRITORY OPERATIONS: Net sales in the Foreign Territory totaled $19
819
600 in fiscal year 2015
 compared to $21
785
400 during
fiscal year 2014
 a decrease of $1
965
800 or 9%. The decrease is attributable to lower sales volume due to decline in number
of restaurants serving Kingfisher and unfavorable exchange rate in continental Europe resulting in decline in export to that region.

COST
OF GOODS SOLD

Overall
cost of goods sold during fiscal year 2015 was $21
407
500
 as compared to $23
435
100 during fiscal year 2014
 a decrease of
$2
027
600
 or 9%. As a percentage of net sales
 costs of goods sold was 69% in 2015 and 2014.

Utilization
of our production capacity has a direct impact on cost. Generally
 when facilities are operating at a higher percentage of production
capacity
 cost is favorably affected because fixed and semi-variable operating costs
 such as depreciation and production costs
are spread over a larger volume base. Our production capacity is currently under-utilized. In addition to capacity utilization
other factors that could affect cost of sales include unanticipated increases in material and shipping costs
 the availability
and prices of raw materials and packaging materials
 and the availability of contract brewing arrangements.


    
    



NORTH
AMERICAN TERRITORY OPERATIONS: Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales in the North American Territory was 83% during
fiscal year 2015 compared to 84% in fiscal year 2014. Underutilization of our production capacity
 as described above
 was a factor
in costs of goods sold in North America in 2015. The lower sales volume in 2015 caused further decreases in productivity.

FOREIGN
TERRITORY OPERATIONS: As a percentage of net sales
 cost of goods sold in the United Kingdom was 61% during fiscal year 2015 and
2014.

GROSS
PROFIT

As
a result of decreased sales
 offset by decreased cost of goods
 gross profit for fiscal year 2015 (expressed in United States
dollars) was $9
776
200
 a decrease of $827
900
 or 8%
 as compared to gross profit of $10
604
100 in fiscal year 2014. As a percentage
of net sales
 our overall gross profit was 31% during fiscal year 2015 and 2014.

OPERATING
EXPENSES

Operating
expenses consist of marketing and distribution expenses
 and general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses for fiscal
year 2015 totaled $10
428
800
 a decrease of $1
094
500
 or 10%
 as compared to $11
523
300 for fiscal year 2014. As a percentage
of net sales
 operating expenses decreased to 33% during fiscal year 2015as compared to 34% in fiscal year 2014.

MARKETING
AND DISTRIBUTION EXPENSES: Our marketing and distribution expenses consist of salaries and commissions
 advertising costs
 product
and sales promotion costs
 travel expenses
 and retail operating expenses. For fiscal year 2015
 such expenses equaled $5
888
600
an increase of $1
400 as compared to $5
887
200 in fiscal year 2014. As a percentage of net sales
 our marketing and distribution
expenses increased to 19% in fiscal year 2015
 as compared to 17% in fiscal year 2014.

NORTH
AMERICAN TERRITORY OPERATIONS: Marketing and distribution expenses for the North American Territory in fiscal year 2015 equaled
$1
320
900
 a decrease of $112
800
 or 8%
 as compared to $1
433
700 incurred during fiscal year 2014
 mainly due to reduction
in manpower and related costs. Marketing and distribution expenses remained at 12% of North American Territory net sales during
fiscal years 2015 and 2014.

FOREIGN
TERRITORY OPERATIONS: Marketing and distribution expenses in the Foreign Territory during fiscal year 2015 equaled $4
567
700
an increase of $114
200
 or 3%
 as compared to $4
453
500 during fiscal year 2014. Such increase is mainly due to an increase
in manpower and increased promotional expenses. As a percentage of net sales in the United Kingdom
 such expenses increased to
23% during fiscal year 2015 compared to 20% during 2014.

GENERAL
AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES: General and administrative expenses include all expenses not characterized as sales and marketing
expenses. Our general and administrative expenses totaled $4
540
200 for fiscal year 2015
 representing a decrease of $1
095
900
or 19%
 as compared to $5
636
100 for fiscal year 2014. General and administrative expenses equaled 15% of net sales for fiscal
year 2015 and 17% of net sales for fiscal year 2014.

NORTH
AMERICAN TERRITORY OPERATIONS: General and administrative expenses for our North American Territory equaled $1
771
400 for fiscal
year 2015
 representing a decrease of $766
700
 or 30%
 as compared to $2
538
100 for fiscal year 2014
 due to a one-time accrual
in the year 2014 of severance payable to our President &amp; Chief Executive Officer at the termination of his employment contract
pursuant to the terms of his separation and severance agreement with the Company (see Item 11. Executive Compensation &ndash;
Elements of Compensation 

FOREIGN
TERRITORY OPERATIONS: General and administrative expenses for our Foreign Territory equaled $2
768
800 in fiscal year 2015
 representing
a decrease of $329
200
 or 11%
 as compared to $3
098
000 for fiscal year 2014
 mainly due to exchange rate fluctuation
 reduction
in rent due to reduction in office space and lower depreciation expense.


    
    



OTHER
EXPENSES

Other
expenses
 including interest expenses
 totaled $492
100 in fiscal year 2015
 representing a decrease of $128
200
 or 21%
 as compared
to $620
300 in fiscal year 2014
 due to lower interest expenses due to reduction in borrowing and higher other income.

INCOME
TAXES

We
made a provision for income taxes of $3
800 for the fiscal year 2015. We did not make any provision for income taxes for the fiscal
year 2014 due to losses.

NET
LOSS

Our
net loss for fiscal year 2015 was $1
148
500
 as compared to a net loss of $1
539
500 for fiscal year 2014. After providing for
a positive foreign currency translation adjustment of $18
200 during fiscal year 2015 (as compared to a positive foreign currency
translation adjustment of $40
500 for fiscal year 2014)
 comprehensive loss for fiscal year 2015 was $1
130
300
 compared to comprehensive
loss of $1
499
000 for fiscal year 2014. As stated above
 the primary reason for the loss in fiscal year 2015 was the drop in
sales revenues.

RETAIL
OPERATIONS

We
operate a tasting room and merchandise store where we serve our brews on tap. We also sell various items of apparel and memorabilia
bearing the Company&rsquo;s trademarks
 which creates further awareness of our beers and reinforces our branding. Although sales
revenues from retail operations are not significant ($279
500 in 2015 and $247
400 in 2014)
 we view them as a marketing opportunity
for our products.

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Unused
capacity at our Ukiah
 California and Saratoga Springs
 New York facilities has continued to place demands on our working capital.
Historically
 our operations have not generated sufficient cash flow to provide us with sufficient working capital. However
 we
have received $400
000 this year and believe that the liquidity we would derive from debt financing in the form of an additional
$600
000 of bridge loans
 approved by the board of directors of UBHL
 and cash flow attributable to our operations would be sufficient
to fund our capital expenditures
 debt maturities and other business needs for the next twelve months.

On
December 9
 2015
 the Company engaged Gordian Group
 LLC (&ldquo;Gordian Group&rdquo;) to serve as the Company&rsquo;s exclusive
investment banker to assist the Company in evaluating
 exploring and
 if deemed appropriate by the Company
 pursuing and implementing
certain strategic and financial options and transactions that may be available to the Company
 including in connection with a
possible debt or equity capital financing
 merger
 consolidation
 joint venture or other business combination involving
 or sale
of substantially all or a material portion of the assets (outside of the ordinary course of business) or outstanding securities
of
 the Company and/or its subsidiaries
 and/or the acquisition of substantially all or a material portion of the assets or outstanding
securities of another entity (each
 a &ldquo;Financial Transaction&rdquo;). Gordian Group is a New York-based independent investment
banking firm. While the Company has commenced evaluating its available options
 no conclusion as to any specific option or transaction
has been reached
 nor has any specific timetable been fixed for this effort
 and there can be no assurance that any strategic
or financial option or transaction will be presented
 implemented or consummated. The Company intends to use proceeds of the Financial
Transaction to repay the amount owed to MB Financial when it becomes due.

UBHL
Support
 UBHL
 our indirect majority shareholder
 issued
a letter of comfort to the Company&rsquo;s accountants on March 5
 2015 (the &ldquo;Letter of Comfort&rdquo;)
 to confirm that
UBHL would provide funding on an as needed basis to ensure that the Company is able to meet its financial obligations as and when
they fall due. The Letter of Comfort does not specify either the terms of UBHL&rsquo;s support
 or a maximum dollar limit. UBHL&rsquo;s
financial support is contingent upon compliance with any applicable exchange control requirements
 other applicable laws and regulations
relating to the transfer of funds from India and is not a legally binding guarantee. The Letter of Comfort does not specify any
time limit for extending support. If it becomes necessary to seek UBHL&rsquo;s financial assistance under the Letter of Comfort
and UBHL is either unable or unwilling to provide such financial assistance
 it may result in a material adverse effect on our
financial position and on our ability to continue operations. UBHL controls the Company&rsquo;s two largest shareholders
 United
Breweries of America
 Inc. (&ldquo;UBA&rdquo;) and Inversiones
 and as such
 is the Company&rsquo;s indirect majority shareholder.
Our Chairman of the Board
 Dr. Vijay Mallya
 is also the Chairman of the board of directors of UBHL.


    
    



The
Company received a letter dated November 11
 2013 from UBHL expressing its willingness to commit to invest $2
000
000 in the Company
in four installments to be paid every six months over a two year period. The letter did not state definitive terms for the proposed
investment. UBHL would consider such additional investment based on a business plan to be provided by the Company. We provided
a business plan in February 2015 and requested additional investment from UBHL and are awaiting UBHL&rsquo;s response. If we are
unable to come to a final agreement with UBHL on the terms of the proposed investment or if UBHL does not agree to provide additional
investment
 we will pursue other sources of funds.

If
we are unable to find any source of funds
 it may result in a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations. For
example
 MB Financial may seek to satisfy any outstanding obligations through recourse against the applicable pledged collateral
which may include our real property
 fixed assets and current assets. The loss of any material pledged asset would likely have
a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.

On
January 22
 2014
 Catamaran Services
 Inc.
 (&ldquo;Catamaran&rdquo;)
 a related party provided a note loan of $500
000 repayable

 2014
 another note loan of $500
000
was received from Catamaran on terms similar to the previous note. On February 5
 2015
 another note loan of $500
000 was received
from Catamaran on terms similar to the previous notes. On June 30
 2015
 a fourth note was issued by the Company in the principal
amount of $500
000 to Catamaran on terms similar to the previous notes
 and the Company received the proceeds against this note
on July 6
 2015. Each time Catamaran provided a note loan
 the Company received a letter from Lender (as defined below) permitting
the Company to obtain such loans subject to certain conditions
 including that no portion of such loans would be payable until
either (a) certain obligations of the Company to Lender pursuant to the Agreement were satisfied in full
 or (b) such payment
was a Permitted Payment. A &ldquo;Permitted Payment&rdquo; is a payment made from an equity investment by the Company&rsquo;s
majority shareholder.

On
March 14
 2016
 a fifth note was issued by the Company in the principal amount of $325
000 to Catamaran on terms substantially
similar to the previous notes
 except that the definition of &ldquo;Permitted Payment&rdquo; was revised to mean
 for purposes
of this fifth note
 a payment made from a bridge loan by the Company&rsquo;s majority shareholder in excess of $600
000 (a &ldquo;Permitted
Bridge Loan Payment&rdquo;). On March 30
 2016
 a sixth note was issued by the Company in the principal amount of $75
000 to Catamaran
on terms substantially similar to the fifth note.

MB
Financial Facility
 2011
 MBC and Releta entered into a Credit and Security Agreement (the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;)
with Cole Taylor Bank
 an Illinois banking corporation (&ldquo;Cole Taylor&rdquo;). Cole Taylor merged into MB Financial Bank
an Illinois banking corporation (&ldquo;MB Financial&rdquo;) on August 18
 2014. As used in this Report
 &ldquo;Lender&rdquo;
shall refer to Cole Taylor prior to August 18
 2014 and to MB Financial
 as successor in interest to Cole Taylor
 on or after
August 18
 2014. The Agreement provides a credit facility with a maturity date of June 23
 2016 of up to $10
000
000 consisting
of a $4
119
000 revolving facility
 a $1
934
000 machinery and equipment term loan
 a $2
947
000 real estate term loan and a $1
000
000
capital expenditure line of credit. Convertible promissory notes issued to UBA
 one of the Company&rsquo;s principal shareholders
are subordinated to Lender&rsquo;s facility.

The
Agreement requires MBC and Releta to maintain certain minimum fixed charge coverage ratios for trailing twelve month periods and
minimum tangible net worth. The minimum tangible net worth MBC and Releta are required to maintain is subject to increase based
on the net income of MBC and Releta. On March 29
 2013
 MBC
 Releta
 and Lender entered into a First Amendment to the Agreement
to clarify the method by which the fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated
 with retrospective application.

The
required fixed charge coverage ratio for the trailing twelve month periods ended March 31
 2013 and onwards fell short of the
required ratio. The tangible net worth fell short of the required amount for the period beginning June 1
 2013 and onwards.

On
September 18
 2013
 MBC and Releta received a notice (the &ldquo;Default Notice&rdquo;) from Lender regarding its intention to
exercise certain rights with respect to events of default of the Company pursuant to the Agreement. The Default Notice states
that Lender has elected
 effective September 1
 2013
 to charge a default interest rate equal to two percent (2%) per annum in
excess of the interest rate otherwise payable under the Agreement. The Company estimates that the increased rate currently results
in approximately $120
000 additional annual interest expense.


    
    



On
April 18
 2014
 MBC and Releta received a second notice (the &ldquo;Second Default Notice&rdquo;) from Lender regarding its intention
to exercise certain rights with respect to events of default of the Company pursuant to the Agreement. As stated in the Second
Default Notice
 the Company continued to be in default on the fixed charge coverage ratio for each measurement period beginning
March 31
 2013 through February 28
 2016. The required fixed charge coverage ratio was initially required to be at least 1.05
to 1.00
 but as of July 31
 2013
 the required fixed charge coverage ratio increased to 1.10 to 1.00 pursuant to the terms of
the Agreement. The Second Default Notice also stated that the tangible net worth of MBC and Releta continued to fall short of
the required amount as measured through February 28
 2014.

The
Second Default Notice required MBC and Releta to engage a consultant to perform a viability analysis and prepare a revised projection
for 2014
 to be delivered to Lender on or before April 30
 2014. MBC and Releta engaged a consultant and delivered a revised projection
on April 30
 2014.

Effective
August 20
 2014
 pursuant to a notice to MBC and Releta dated August 18
 2014 (the &ldquo;Third Default Notice&rdquo;) which referred
to MBC&rsquo;s and Releta&rsquo;s continued failure to meet the required fixed charge coverage ratio and the tangible net worth
requirement
 Lender notified MBC and Releta that it would reduce the advance rate for (i) eligible finished goods and raw material
inventory and (ii) eligible work-in progress inventory by 2% each month. The advance rates are used in the calculation of the
borrowing base of each of MBC and Releta
 which is used in the determination of the amount available to each of MBC and Releta
pursuant to the revolving facility. Under the terms of the Agreement
 if such availability is less than $0
 or if certain components
of the borrowing base of each of MBC and Releta fall below certain limits in relation to outstanding revolving loans
 such difference
shall be immediately due and payable.

On
January 21
 2015
 MBC
 Releta
 and Lender entered into a Second Amendment (the &ldquo;Second Amendment&rdquo;) to the Agreement.

The
Second Amendment reduces the maximum amount of the Revolver from $4
119
000 to $2
500
000. The Second Amendment also changes the
definition of borrowing base (including by lowering certain advance rates) such that the calculation of the borrowing base will
result in a lower number than it would have if calculated prior to the effectiveness of the Second Amendment. The borrowing base
is used in the determination of the amount available to each Borrower pursuant to the Revolver. Pursuant to the Agreement
 if
such availability is less than $0
 or if certain components of the borrowing base fall below certain limits in relation to outstanding
revolving loans
 such difference shall be immediately due and payable.

The
Second Amendment reduced the advance rate for (i) eligible finished goods and raw material inventory and (ii) eligible work-in
progress inventory by two percent (2%) and continues to reduce each by an additional two percent (2%) on the 20th day of each
month thereafter. The advance rates are used in the calculation of the borrowing base of each Borrower
 which is used in the determination
of the amount available to each Borrower pursuant to the Revolver. As stated above
 if such availability is less than $0
 or if
certain components of the borrowing base fall below certain limits in relation to outstanding revolving loans
 such difference
shall be immediately due and payable.

As
of December 31
 2015
 the fixed charge coverage ratio was required to be 1.15 to 1. The Company calculated that the fixed charge
coverage ratio as of December 31
 2015 was -0.28 to 1. The Company calculated that the required tangible net worth of MBC and
Releta was $6
181
400 as of December 31
 2015 and the actual tangible net worth on such date was $3
738
400. The Company does
not anticipate that it will regain compliance with the required fixed charge coverage ratio or the minimum tangible net worth
in the immediate future.

The
Agreement provides that the failure of MBC and Releta to observe any covenant will constitute an event of default under the Agreement.
Under the Agreement
 upon the occurrence of an event of default
 all of MBC&rsquo;s and Releta&rsquo;s obligations under the Agreement
may
 at MB Financial&rsquo;s option
 be declared
 and immediately shall become
 due and payable
 without notice of any kind. An
event of default shall be deemed continuing until waived in writing by MB Financial. Lender has not waived the events of default
described in the Default Notice
 the Second Default Notice or the Third Default Notice and has reserved the right to all other
available rights and remedies under the Agreement
 certain other related documents and applicable law. Since receiving the Second
Amendment
 the Company has not received any notice or other communication from Lender that it intends to exercise any other remedies
available to it under the Agreement in connection with the events of default. Lender elected to charge a default interest rate
equal to two percent (2%) per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable under the Agreement effective September 1
2013. The Company estimates that the increased interest rate has resulted in the payment by the Company to MB Financial of an
additional interest of approximately $120
000 for the first year. The exercise of additional remedies by MB Financial may have
a material adverse effect on the Company&rsquo;s financial condition and the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue to operate. The
Agreement expires on June 23
 2016. If the Agreement is not renewed
 and it becomes necessary for MBC and Releta to seek additional
financing due to non-renewal or for other reasons
 there is no guarantee that MBC and Releta will be able to obtain such financing
on terms favorable to the Company or on any terms.


    
    



HUK
Facility
 2013
 KBEL entered into a Loan Agreement with HUK pursuant to which HUK agreed to provide KBEL with
a secured term loan facility of &pound;1
000
000 to be made available
 subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions precedent
on October 9
 2013
 and to be repaid in full by October 9
 2016. KBEL availed itself of the loan on October 9
 2013. The Loan
Agreement with HUK is described under the section captioned &ldquo;Description Of Our Indebtedness&rdquo; below.

Our
ability to meet future working capital requirements will depend on many factors
 including the rate of our revenue growth or contraction
whether we successfully introduce new products and expansion of sales and marketing activities. There can be no assurance that
we will be able to increase sales to provide cash for operating activities. To the extent our available cash is insufficient to
fund our future activities
 we may need to raise additional funds through bank credit arrangements
 or public or private equity
or debt financings. We may not be able to obtain bank credit arrangements or to effect an equity or debt financing on terms acceptable
to us or at all.

We
have several loans
 lines of credit
 other credit facilities and lease agreements which are currently outstanding (collectively
&ldquo;Indebtedness&rdquo;). We currently make timely payments of principal and interest relating to the Indebtedness as they
fall due and anticipate that we will continue to make such timely payments in the immediate future. However
 if we fail to maintain
any of the financial covenants under the various agreements governing Indebtedness (such as the defaults under the Agreement described
above)
 fail to make timely payments of amounts due under the Indebtedness
 or commit any other breach resulting in an event of
default under the agreements governing Indebtedness
 such events of default (including cross-defaults) could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition. If our existing debt were accelerated and terminated
 we would need to obtain replacement financing
the lack of which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to continue operations. In addition
actions taken by secured parties against the Company&rsquo;s assets which have been pledged as collateral could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.

At
December 31
 2015
 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $129
600
 an accumulated deficit of $17
395
600
 and a working
capital deficit of $11
601
700 due to losses incurred
 reclassification of debts owing to MB Financial as a result of the default
under the Credit and Security Agreement described above and reclassification of subordinated notes payable to UBA maturing in
June 2016. In addition
 the book value of the Company&rsquo;s assets was lower than the book value of its liabilities at December
31
 2015.

Management
has taken several actions to reduce the Company&rsquo;s working capital needs through December 31
 2016
 including reducing discretionary
expenditures
 reducing manpower
 securing additional brewing contracts in an effort to utilize a portion of excess production
capacity
 and pursuing export opportunities. The Company is pursuing a Financial Transaction through Gordian Group as described
above. The Company continues to receive cash infusion from Catamaran to support operations. The current revenue from operations
is insufficient to meet the working capital needs of the Company over the next 12 months. The Company has requested UBHL to make
a capital infusion. If sufficient capital for working capital needs is not obtained
 the Company may sell some of its operating
assets.

If
the Company is unable to find any source of funds
 it may result in a material adverse effect on the Company&rsquo;s ability to
continue operations. If it becomes necessary to seek UBHL&rsquo;s financial assistance under the Letter of Comfort and UBHL does
not provide such financial assistance to MBC
 it may result in a material adverse effect on the Company&rsquo;s financial position
and on its ability to continue operations. In addition
 the Company&rsquo;s lenders may seek to satisfy any outstanding obligations
through recourse against the applicable pledged collateral which may include the Company&rsquo;s real property and fixed and current
assets. The loss of any material pledged asset would have a material adverse effect on the Company&rsquo;s financial position
and results of operations.


    
    



Cash
Flow Results:

Historically
we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from issuances of preferred stock
 Common Stock
 debt financing
 lease financing
and cash flows from operations.

Net
cash provided by operations was $1
105
900 and $793
400 for 2015 and 2014 respectively. During the year ended December 31
 2015
the primary factors contributing to our calculation of net cash provided by operating activities were non-cash expenses consisting
primarily of depreciation expense of $1
226
200
 accrued severance payable of $38
000
 decrease in accounts receivable of $430
800
decrease in accounts payable of $262
100
 increase in accrued liabilities of $186
400
 decrease in inventory of $567
500 and net
loss of $1
148
500.

Decreases
in receivables
 inventories and accounts payable during the year 2015 were due to lower sales volume in the year 2015 compared
to 2014. Increase in accrued liabilities in 2015 compared to 2014 was mainly due to accrued Directors Compensation for the year
2015.

Net
cash used in investing activities was $642
400 and $876
100
 respectively
 for 2015 and 2014. Such funds were used primarily for
purchases of brewery equipment in the North American Territory and beer dispensing equipment in the Foreign Territory.

Net
cash used in financing activities was $493
500 during the year 2015 compared to $117
600 used in such activities in 2014. During
2015 and 2014
 we borrowed from Catamaran to finance working capital. Financing activities also include debt payments and lease
installment payments.

DESCRIPTION
OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS:

MB
FINANCIAL FACILITY: On June 23
 2011
 MBC and Releta entered into the Agreement with Lender (as described in &ldquo;Liquidity
and Capital Resources&rdquo;) which is scheduled to expire on June 23
 2016. The Agreement provides a credit facility of up to
$10
000
000 with a maturity date of June 23
 2016
 consisting of a $4
119
000 revolving facility
 a $1
934
000 machinery and equipment
term loan
 a $2
947
000 real estate term loan and a $1
000
000 capital expenditure line of credit. At the time that the applicable
loan or advance is made
 we may choose
 subject to certain contingencies
 an interest rate based on either LIBOR or the Wall Street
Journal prime rate as follows: (a) with respect to the revolving facility
 either LIBOR plus a margin of 3.50% or the Wall Street
Journal prime rate plus a margin of 1.00%
 (b) with respect to the machinery and equipment term loan and the capital expenditure
term loan
 either LIBOR plus a margin of 4.25% or the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus a margin of 1.50%
 and (c) with respect
to the real estate term loan
 either LIBOR plus a margin of 4.75% or the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus a margin of 2.00%.
As described below
 effective September 1
 2013
 Lender is charging a default interest rate equal to two percent (2%) per annum
in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable under the Agreement. As described in the Third Default Notice
 effective August
20
 2014
 Lender notified MBC and Releta that it would reduce the advance rate for (i) eligible finished goods and raw material
inventory and (ii) eligible work-in progress inventory by 2% each month. The advance rates are used in the calculation of the
borrowing base of each of MBC and Releta
 which is used in the determination of the amount available to each of MBC and Releta
pursuant to the revolving facility. Under the terms of the Agreement
 if such availability is less than $0
 or if certain components
of the borrowing base of each of MBC and Releta fall below certain limits in relation to outstanding revolving loans
 such difference
shall be immediately due and payable. The Agreement binds us to certain financial covenants including maintaining prescribed minimum
tangible net worth and prescribed minimum fixed charges coverage. There is a prepayment penalty if we prepay all of our obligations
prior to the maturity date. The credit facility is secured by a first priority interest in all of MBC&rsquo;s and Releta&rsquo;s
personal property and a first mortgage on our Ukiah
 California real property
 among other MBC and Releta assets.

On
March 29
 2013
 MBC and Releta entered into the Amendment to the Agreement (as described in &ldquo;Liquidity and Capital Resources&rdquo;).
The Amendment clarifies the method by which the fixed charge coverage ratio shall be calculated.


    
    


As
previously disclosed
 the Company has been and remains in default of the fixed charge coverage ratio and the minimum tangible
net worth requirement among other covenants contained in the Agreement. On September 18
 2013
 April 18
 2014 and August 18
 2014
MBC and Releta received the Default Notice
 the Second Default Notice and the Third Default Notice
 respectively
 from Lender
regarding its intention to exercise certain rights with respect to events of default of the Company pursuant to the Agreement.
Under the Agreement
 upon the occurrence of an event of default
 all of MBC&rsquo;s and Releta&rsquo;s obligations under the Agreement
may
 at the option of Lender
 be declared
 and immediately shall become
 due and payable
 without notice of any kind. The Default
Notice stated that Lender has elected to charge a default interest rate equal to two percent (2%) per annum in excess of the interest
rate otherwise payable under the Agreement effective September 1
 2013. The Second Default Notice required MBC and Releta to engage
a consultant to perform a viability analysis and prepare a revised projection for 2014. The Third Default Notice notified us that
Lender would be reducing the advance rate for (i) eligible finished goods and raw material inventory and (ii) eligible work-in
progress inventory by 2% each month. For more details on the defaults
 please refer to &ldquo;Liquidity and Capital Resources&rdquo;
in Item 2 above.

On
January 21
 2015
 MBC
 Releta
 and Lender entered into a Second Amendment (the &ldquo;Second Amendment&rdquo;) to the Agreement.

The
Second Amendment reduces the maximum amount of the Revolver from $4
119
000 to $2
500
000. The Second Amendment also changes the
definition of borrowing base (including by lowering certain advance rates) such that the calculation of the borrowing base will
result in a lower number than it would have if calculated prior to the effectiveness of the Second Amendment. The borrowing base
is used in the determination of the amount available to each Borrower pursuant to the Revolver. Pursuant to the Agreement
 if
such availability is less than $0
 or if certain components of the borrowing base fall below certain limits in relation to outstanding
revolving loans
 such difference shall be immediately due and payable.

The
Second Amendment reduced the advance rate for (i) eligible finished goods and raw material inventory and (ii) eligible work-in
progress inventory by two percent (2%) and continues to reduce each by an additional two percent (2%) on the 20th day of each
month thereafter. The advance rates are used in the calculation of the borrowing base of each Borrower
 which is used in the determination
of the amount available to each Borrower pursuant to the Revolver. As stated above
 if such availability is less than $0
 or if
certain components of the borrowing base fall below certain limits in relation to outstanding revolving loans
 such difference
shall be immediately due and payable.

MASTER
LINE OF CREDIT: On August 31
 1999
 MBC and UBA
 one of our principal shareholders
 entered into a Master Line of Credit Agreement
which was subsequently amended in April 2000 and February 2001 (the &ldquo;Credit Agreement&rdquo;). The terms of the Credit Agreement
provide us with a line of credit in the principal amount of up to $1
600
000. As of the date of this filing
 UBA has made thirteen
separate advances to us under the Credit Agreement and one additional advance on March 2
 2005 on substantially the same terms
as those under the Credit Agreement
 pursuant to a series of individual eighteen-month promissory notes issued by us to UBA (the
&ldquo;UBA Notes&rdquo;). Thirteen of the UBA Notes are convertible into common stock at a rate of $1.50 per share and one UBA
Note is convertible at a rate of $1.44 per share. UBA has executed an Extension of Term of Notes under Master Line of Credit Agreement
and an amendment to the March 2
 2005 note (together
 the &ldquo;Extension Agreements&rdquo;). The Extension Agreements
 as amended
confirm UBA&rsquo;s extension of the terms of the UBA Notes for a period ending on June 30
 2016 with automatic renewals after
such maturity date for successive one year terms
 provided that either MBC or UBA may elect not to extend a term upon written
notice given to the other party no more than 60 days and no fewer than 30 days prior to the expiration of the applicable term.

The
UBA Notes require us to make quarterly interest payments to UBA on the first day of April
 July
 October
 and January. To date
UBA has permitted us to capitalize all accrued interest; therefore
 we have borrowed the maximum amount available under the facility.
Upon maturity of any of the UBA Notes
 unless UBA has given us prior instructions to commence repayment of the outstanding principal
balance
 the outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest on such UBA Notes may be converted
 at the option of UBA
 into
shares of our common stock. During the extended term of the UBA Notes
 UBA has the right to require us to repay the outstanding
principal balance
 along with the accrued and unpaid interest thereon
 to UBA within 60 days.

The
UBA Notes are subordinated to credit facilities extended to us by MB Financial pursuant to a subordination agreement executed
by UBA. Per the terms of the subordination agreement
 UBA is precluded from demanding repayment of the UBA Notes unless and until
the MB Financial facilities are repaid in full.

The
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the UBA Notes as of December 31
 2015 was $1
915
400
 and the accrued but unpaid interest
thereon was equal to approximately $1
764
700
 for a total amount outstanding of $3
680
100. As of December 31
 2015
 the outstanding
principal and interest on the UBA Notes was convertible into approximately 2
471
800 shares of our common stock. However
 as the
current market price of our common stock is substantially less than the conversion rate
 voluntary conversion by UBA is unlikely.


    
    


During
the fiscal years 2015 and 2014
 the greatest aggregate amount of principal outstanding on the UBA Notes was $1
915
400. No principal
or interest was paid during fiscal years 2015 or 2014. As of February 28
 2016
 the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
the UBA Notes was $1
915
400
 and the accrued but unpaid interest thereon was equal to approximately $1
780
500
 for a total amount
outstanding of $3
695
900
 convertible into approximately 2
482
400 shares of our Common Stock. As of February 28
 2016
 UBA beneficially
owned approximately 24.5% of our outstanding Common Stock (excluding any shares issuable upon conversion of the UBA Notes). Our
Chairman
 Dr. Vijay Mallya
 is also the Chairman of the board of directors of UBA.

CATAMARAN
NOTES: On January 22
 2014
 Catamaran Services
 Inc.
 (&ldquo;Catamaran&rdquo;)
 a related party provided a note loan of $500
000
repayable upon receipt of an equity investment by the Company&rsquo;s majority shareholder. Catamaran Holdings
 Ltd.
 the sole
shareholder of Catamaran (&ldquo;Holdings&rdquo;) has directors in common with Inversiones
 one of the major shareholders of the
Company. The indirect beneficial owner of Inversiones is UBHL. On April 24
 2014
 another note loan of $500
000 was received from
Catamaran on terms similar to the previous note. On February 5
 2015
 another note loan of $500
000 was received from Catamaran
on terms similar to the previous notes. On June 30
 2015
 another note loan of $500
000 was issued to Catamaran on terms similar
to the previous notes. Each time Catamaran provided a note loan
 the Company received a letter from MB Financial (as defined below)
permitting the Company to obtain loans subject to certain conditions
 including that no portion of such loans would be payable
until either (a) certain obligations of the Company to MB Financial pursuant to the Agreement were satisfied in full
 or (b) such
payment was a Permitted Payment. A &ldquo;Permitted Payment&rdquo; is a payment made from an equity investment by the Company&rsquo;s
majority shareholder.

Pursuant
to the terms of the first four Catamaran notes
 the Company promises to pay each such note with accrued interest
 as described
below
 to Catamaran within six months following the date of the note
 subject to the receipt by the Company of an equity investment
by its majority shareholder (the &ldquo;Shareholder Investment&rdquo;) in an amount sufficient either (a) to pay the notes through
Permitted Payments
 or (b) to pay both the notes and certain existing obligations of the Company to Lender in full.

On
March 14
 2016
 a fifth note was issued by the Company in the principal amount of $325
000 to Catamaran on terms substantially
similar to the previous notes
 except that the definition of &ldquo;Permitted Payment&rdquo; was revised to mean
 for purposes
of this fifth note
 a payment made from a bridge loan by the Company&rsquo;s majority shareholder in excess of $600
000. On March
30
 2016
 a sixth note was issued by the Company in the principal amount of $75
000 to Catamaran on terms substantially similar
to the fifth note.

Pursuant
to the terms of the fifth and sixth Catamaran Notes
 the Company promises to pay the principal sum of $325
000 and $75
000 respectively
with accrued interest (as described below) to Catamaran within six months following the dates of such notes
 subject to the receipt
&rdquo;) in an amount sufficient
either (a) to pay such notes through Permitted Bridge Loan Payments
 or (b) to pay the notes and certain existing obligations
of the Company to the Lender in full.

If
the Company is not able to satisfy its obligations on a Catamaran note within the six month period following the date thereof
such note shall be automatically extended for an additional six month term until a Permitted Payment (for the first through fourth
notes) or Permitted Bridge Loan Payment (for the fifth and sixth notes)
 as the case may be
 can be made or such note is otherwise
paid. Interest shall accrue from the date of the applicable Catamaran note on the unpaid principal at a rate equal to the lesser
of (i) one and one-half percent (1.5%) per annum above the prime rate offered from time to time by the Bank of America Corporation
in San Francisco
 California
 or (ii) ten percent (10%) per annum
 until the principal is fully paid.

The
Catamaran notes may be prepaid without penalty at the option of the Company; however
 no payments on the Catamaran notes may be
made unless such payment is a Permitted Payment (for the first through fourth notes) or a Permitted Bridge Loan Payment (for the
fifth and sixth notes)
 as the case may
 be or certain existing obligations of the Company to MB Financial pursuant to the Credit
Agreement have been satisfied in full. The Catamaran notes may not be amended without the prior written consent of MB Financial.


    
    


HUK
LOAN: On April 18
 2013
 KBEL entered into a Loan Agreement with HUK pursuant to which HUK provided KBEL with a secured term loan

 2005
 Royal Bank of Scotland Commercial Services Limited (&ldquo;RBS&rdquo;) provided
KBEL with an approximately $2.8 million (&pound;1
750
000) maximum revolving line of credit with an advance rate based on 80%
of KBEL&rsquo;s qualified accounts receivable. This facility has a minimum maturity of twelve months
 but will be automatically
extended unless terminated by either party upon six months&rsquo; written notice.

On
November 24
 2015
 KBEL received a notice from RBS regarding its intention to terminate the credit line and all other banking
services it currently provides to KBEL on February 26
 2016. RBS subsequently extended the termination date to May 31
 2016. KBEL
is in the process of finding a substitute replacement for the line of credit and other banking services before the termination
of the Credit Line is effective. We have been in discussions a bank which has provided an indicative offer to provide KBEL with
alternate financing and other banking services in place of RBS. If KBEL does not finalize such alternate financing and provision
of banking services
 and if KBEL is unable to find a substitute replacement before termination of the RBS facilities
 this would
have a material adverse effect on KBEL and the Company.

 2015 was 0.91 to 1.0 and on December 31
 2014 was 0.98
to 1.0.

RESTRICTED
NET ASSETS. Our wholly-owned subsidiary
 UBIUK
 had cumulative losses of approximately $317
600 as of December 31

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements
 which have
been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;). The preparation
of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets
 liabilities
and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We review our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base
our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may
differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are described
in more detail in Note 1 to our financial statements
 we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments
and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

Revenue
Recognition
Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) 605 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;). The Company recognizes
revenue from product sales
 net of discounts.

The
Company recognizes revenue only when all of the following criteria have been met:



    
    
Persuasive
    evidence of an arrangement exists;

    
    
    

    
    
Delivery
    has occurred or services have been rendered;

    
    
    

    
    
The
    fee for the arrangement is fixed or determinable; and

    
    
    

    
    
Collectability
    is reasonably assured.


&ldquo;Persuasive
Evidence of an Arrangement&rdquo; &ndash; The Company documents all terms of an arrangement in a written contract or purchase
order signed by the customer prior to recognizing revenue.

&ldquo;Delivery
Has Occurred or Services Have Been Performed&rdquo; &ndash; The Company delivers the products prior to recognizing revenue or
performs services as per contractual terms. Product is considered delivered upon delivery to a customer&rsquo;s designated location
and services are considered performed upon completion of the Company&rsquo;s contractual obligations.

&ldquo;The
Fee for the Arrangement is Fixed or Determinable&rdquo; &ndash; Prior to recognizing revenue
 an amount is either fixed or determinable
under the terms of the written contract or purchase order. The price is negotiated at the outset of the arrangement and is not
subject to refund or adjustment during the initial term of the arrangement.

&ldquo;Collectability
is Reasonably Assured&rdquo; &ndash; The Company determines that collectability is reasonably assured prior to recognizing revenue.
Collectability is assessed on a customer-by-customer basis based on criteria outlined by Management. The Company does not enter
into arrangements unless collectability is reasonably assured at the outset. Existing customers are subject to ongoing credit
evaluations based on payment history and other factors. If it is determined during the arrangement that collectability is not
reasonably assured
 revenue is recognized on a cash basis.


    
    


The
Company records certain consideration paid to customers for services or placement fees as a reduction in revenue rather than as
an expense. The Company reports these items on the income statement as a reduction in revenue and as a corresponding reduction
in marketing and selling expenses.

Revenues
from the brewpub and gift store are recognized when sales have been completed.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts.
on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of accounts receivable. We review our accounts receivable
balances by customer for accounts greater than 90 days old and make a determination regarding the collectability of the accounts
based on specific circumstances and the payment history that exists with such customers. We also take into account our prior experience
the customer&rsquo;s ability to pay and an assessment of the current economic conditions in determining the net realizable value
of our receivables. We also review our allowances for doubtful accounts in aggregate for adequacy following this assessment. Accordingly
we believe that our allowances for doubtful accounts fairly represent the underlying collectability risks associated with our
accounts receivable.

.
Inventory consists of raw materials
 work in progress
 and finished goods. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market
using the average-cost method. Cost includes the acquisition cost of raw materials and components
 direct labor
 and manufacturing
overhead. We periodically review our inventory for excess or quality issues. Should we conclude that we have inventory for which
we cannot recover our costs as a result of such review
 we would record a charge to cost of goods sold. We record write downs
for excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based on
assumptions about future product life-cycles
 product demand and market conditions. If actual product life cycles
 product demand
and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by Management
 additional inventory write-downs may be required.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets.
of ASC 360-10-50
 (Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets). The Company reviews the carrying value of
property and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be
recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted
expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value
 an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the
carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets. The factors considered by Management in performing this assessment include current
operating results
 trends
 and prospects
 as well as the effects of obsolescence
 demand
 competition
 and other economic factors.
Long-lived assets that Management commits to sell or abandon are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost
to sell.

Foreign
Currency Translation.
the UK Pound Sterling
 is the functional currency
 are translated into United States dollars using period-end exchange rates for
assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during the period for revenues and expenses. Cumulative translation adjustments
associated with net assets or liabilities are reported as non-owner changes in equity. Any exchange rate gains or losses related
to foreign currency transactions are recognized in the income statement as incurred in the same financial statement caption as
the underlying transaction and are not material for any year shown.

Cash
at UBIUK was translated at exchange rates in effect on December 31
 2015 and 2014
 and its cash flows were translated at the average
exchange rates for the years then ended. Changes in cash resulting from the translations are presented as a separate item in the
statements of cash flows.

Income
Taxes
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement bases and the respective
tax bases of the assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
as income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred
tax assets to the amount expected to be realized
 and have been provided for all periods presented.

The
Company periodically assesses uncertain tax positions that the Company has taken or expects to take on a tax return (including
a decision whether to file or not to file a return in a particular jurisdiction). The Company evaluated its tax positions and
determined that there were no uncertain tax benefits for the years ending December 31
 2015 and 2014.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

EVALUATION
OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Our
Management team
 under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer)
and our Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer)
 evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of the last day of
the fiscal period covered by this Annual Report
 December 31
 2015. The term &ldquo;disclosure controls and procedures&rdquo;
means our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified
in the SEC&rsquo;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to Management
 including our principal executive and principal financial officer
 or persons performing similar
functions
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation
 our Chief Executive
Officer (principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer) concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures as of December 31
 2015 were effective.

Report
of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial
reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by
 or under the supervision
of
 the issuer&rsquo;s principal executive and principal financial officers
 or persons performing similar functions
 and effected
by the issuer&rsquo;s board of directors
 Management and other personnel
 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes
those policies and procedures that:

&#9679;
pertain to the maintenance of records that
 in reasonable detail
 accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the issuer;

&#9679;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP
 and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with authorization of
Management and directors of the issuer; and

&#9679;
provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition
 use or disposition of the
issuer&rsquo;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


    
    


Because
of our inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
 projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions or that the degree of compliance with existing policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
accordance with the internal control reporting requirements of the SEC
 Management completed an assessment of the adequacy of
our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2015. In making this assessment
 Management used the criteria
 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO) and the SEC&rsquo;s guide entitled &ldquo;Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404: A Guide for Small Business&rdquo;. As
a result of this assessment and based on the criteria in the COSO framework and SEC guidance
 Management has concluded that
 as
of December 31
 2015
 our internal control over financial reporting was effective.

CHANGES
IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31
 2015 that have materially
affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

Act. James H. Grossman
 Scott R. Heldfond
 Jerome G. Merchant and Kent D. Price serve as the committee members of the Audit/Finance
Committee.

AUDIT
COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT

The
Board has determined that Mr. Kent D. Price
 a member of our Audit/Finance Committee
 is both an independent Director and qualifies
as an &ldquo;audit committee financial expert&rdquo; as that term is defined in the Exchange Act
 and pursuant to the rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC.

Corporate
Governance

Director
Independence

The
Board has determined that the following directors qualify as &ldquo;independent&rdquo; in accordance with the published listing
requirements of NASDAQ: Mr. Cannata
 Mr. Grossman
 Mr. Heldfond
 Mr. Laybourn
 Mr. Palamand
 Mr. Merchant and Mr. Price. Mr. Singh
is not &ldquo;independent&rdquo; because he is an employee of MBC. Dr. Mallya is not independent since he has received payments
in excess of the applicable threshold from the Company during the last three (3) years. Prior to 2007
 Mr. Merchant provided certain
consulting services to the Company
 however
 given the timing and nature of such services as well as the amount of compensation
provided in relation thereto
 the Board has determined that Mr. Merchant now meets the criteria for being an &ldquo;independent
director&rdquo;.

The
NASDAQ rules contain both objective tests and a subjective test for determining who is an &ldquo;independent director.&rdquo;
The objective tests provide that a director is not considered independent if he (i) is an employee of the Company (or a parent
or subsidiary) (or has been in the past three (3) years); (ii) has accepted (or a family member has accepted) compensation from
the Company in excess of $120
000 during any period of twelve (12) consecutive months within the preceding three (3) year period
(subject to certain exceptions); (iii) has a family member that was employed as an executive officer of the Company (or a parent
or subsidiary) during the past three (3) years; (iv) is (or a family member is) a controlling shareholder or an executive officer
of an organization to which the Company made or received payments in the current year or at any time during the past three (3)
years that exceed the greater of (a) five percent (5%) of the recipient&rsquo;s consolidated gross revenues or (b) $200
000 for
that year; (v) is (or has a family member who is) employed as an executive officer of another entity where at any time during
the past three (3) years any of the executive officers of the Company served on the compensation committee of such other entity;
or (vi) is (or has a family member who is) a current partner of the Company&rsquo;s outside auditor who worked on the Company&rsquo;s
audit at any time during any of the past three (3) years. The subjective test is based on the standard that an independent director
must be a person who lacks a relationship that
 in the opinion of the Board
 would interfere with the exercise of independent
judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.

Leadership
Structure

Since
January 2005
 the Company has separated the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. From 1997 until January
2005
 Dr. Vijay Mallya served as both the Chief Executive Officer as well as Chairman of the board of directors of MBC (the &ldquo;Board
of Directors&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;). The Board of Directors believes that the separation of the roles of Chief Executive
Officer and Chairman of the Board provides the Company with additional processes
 controls and oversights that facilitate the
functioning of the Board of Directors and its decision-making in the best interests of MBC and its shareholders. In addition
the separation of the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer permit the holders of such offices to focus on the fundamental
duties and specialized nature of the respective office. MBC&rsquo;s Chairman
 Dr. Vijay Mallya
 and the Board of Directors work
together with the Chief Executive Officer to develop MBC&rsquo;s strategic goals. Dr. Mallya also acts as an international brand
ambassador and presides over the Board of Directors meetings at which he is present. MBC&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer
 Yashpal
Singh
 is responsible for the day-to-day oversight of MBC&rsquo;s performance and the brewing operations. Mr. Singh is also responsible
for the implementation of MBC&rsquo;s strategic goals. The Board of Directors may review its leadership structure from time to
time and implement any changes that it deems appropriate to respond to the needs of the Company.

Risk
Oversight

The
Audit/Finance Committee and Compensation Committee play key roles in the Board of Director&rsquo;s risk oversight function as
such committee members are all Non-Employee Directors. The Committee system provides an independent level of protection with regards
to MBC&rsquo;s decision-making processes and an additional mechanism for the oversight of MBC&rsquo;s risk management controls
and procedures. The Board of Directors as a whole will continue to monitor MBC&rsquo;s general and specific risks and take action
to manage such risk as it deems appropriate or necessary.


    
    



Board
of Directors&rsquo; and Committee Meetings

During
the fiscal year ended December 31
 2015
 the Board of Directors held two meetings and the Audit/Finance Committee held six meetings.
One director did not attend one meeting of the Board of Directors and no director attended fewer than 75% of the meetings of any
committees of which such Director was a member.

Listed
below are the committees of the Board of Directors
 along with the names of the Directors who served as members of each committee
during 2015.

Audit/Finance
Committee

Messrs.
Merchant
 Price (Chair)
 and Heldfond served as the members of the Audit/Finance Committee (established in accordance with Section
3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act) for the fiscal year ended December 31
 2015. This committee met six times during fiscal year
2015. Effective November 10
 2015
 Mr. James Grossman was appointed as a member of this committee. The Audit/Finance Committee
reviews
 acts on
 and reports to the Board of Directors with respect to various auditing
 accounting and finance matters
 including
the selection of the Company&rsquo;s auditors
 the scope of the annual audits
 the fees to be paid to the auditors
 the performance
of the Company&rsquo;s auditors
 and the accounting practices of the Company. In the judgment of MBC&rsquo;s Board of Directors
the members of the Committee are &ldquo;independent
&rdquo; as that term is defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Listing Rules
and also meet the additional criteria for independence of Audit Committee members set forth in Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Exchange
Act. The Board has determined that Mr. Price qualifies as an &ldquo;audit committee financial expert&rdquo; under SEC rules.

Nominating
Committee
 the Board of Directors does not have a nominating committee or a committee performing
similar functions. Instead
 all of the Directors participate in the director nomination process. Mr. Singh and Dr. Mallya do not
meet the criteria to qualify as &ldquo;independent&rdquo; under the rules of NASDAQ or under the applicable rules of the other
national securities exchanges.

Compensation
Committee
 Price
 and Laybourn served as the members of MBC&rsquo;s Compensation Committee for the
full fiscal year ended December 31
 2014
 and effective November 10
 2015
 Mr. Joseph Cannata was appointed as a member of this
committee. The Compensation Committee considers all matters of compensation with respect to the chief executive officer
 president
any vice president
 and any other senior executive
 and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding the compensation
of such persons. The Compensation Committee also makes determinations with respect to the granting of stock awards to directors
who are also employees of MBC. In the judgment of MBC&rsquo;s Board of Directors
 the members of the Compensation Committee are
&ldquo;independent&rdquo; as that term is defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Listing Rules.

Compensation
Narrative

The
Compensation Committee of the Board determines and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding the compensation
for our executive officers. The Compensation Committee reviews all components of the executive officers&rsquo; compensation
 including
making individual compensation decisions and reviewing and revising compensation guidelines as appropriate. The Compensation Committee
also consults with the Chief Executive Officer regarding revisions to the compensation of the Chief Financial Officer and other
non-executive employees
 as appropriate.

We
have entered into an Employment Agreement with our Chief Executive Officer that sets forth the terms of his employment and provides
for certain benefits. The term of the agreement was extended to June 30
 2016. We do not currently have an employment agreement
in place with our Chief Financial Officer. We do not have any severance payment arrangements other than with the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer. We have agreed to reimburse travel expenses for the Chief Executive Officer and his family
to return to their home country upon the termination of the Chief Executive Officer&rsquo;s employment with us. In addition
 if
the Chief Executive Officer is terminated either with or without cause without 12 months&rsquo; notice
 he is entitled to be paid
an amount equal to twelve months of his base salary. We do not have any payment arrangements that would be triggered by a &ldquo;change
in control&rdquo; of MBC. Additionally
 if the Chief Financial Officer is terminated either with or without cause without 12 months&rsquo;
notice
 he is entitled to be paid an amount equal to twelve months of his base salary. We do not have any payment arrangements
that would be triggered by a &ldquo;change in control&rdquo; of MBC.

Total
compensation for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer consists of base salary
 annual cash bonus payments
health care benefits for each such officer and his immediate dependent family members
 use of a company vehicle
 vacation reimbursement
and
 with respect to the Chief Executive Officer only
 life insurance.

Elements
of Compensation

MBC
selected elements of compensation to provide incentives for its executive officers to relocate to the United States from India.
In so doing
 MBC reviewed the compensation packages of its executive officers at their prior positions in India
 so that comparable
packages could be provided.

Base
Salary

The
Compensation Committee reviews executive officers&rsquo; base salaries on an annual basis. Given our stock performance and financial
situation
 there is currently no salary component directly tied to our stock price or to our financial performance. Effective
as of January 1
 2012
 the Compensation Committee recommended and the Board of Directors increased the annual base salary of the
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer to $304
000 and $181
100 respectively. Effective October 1
 2015
the base
salary of the Chief Executive Officer was increased to $334
400 by merging his annual cash bonus element into his base salary.
No adjustments have been made to the salary of Chief Financial Officer during fiscal year 2015.

Annual
Cash Bonus

The
compensation packages for the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer also contain a component providing for payment
of annual cash bonuses. Given MBC&rsquo;s past working capital constraints
 the Compensation Committee historically determined
that a percentage of the cash compensation of the executive officers would be in the form of annual cash bonuses that could be
disbursed following the completion of the applicable fiscal year. In the past few years approximately 10% of the cash compensation
paid to each of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer was paid in the form of a bonus rather than as salary.
Effective October 1
 2015
 the annual cash bonus element of the Chief Executive Officer was merged with his base salary.


    
    


Perquisites
and Personal Benefit

In
addition to salary and annual bonus
 the total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer includes
perquisites and personal benefits. The types of perquisites and personal benefits awarded to such officers were determined when
each such officer commenced employment with us and are substantially of the same nature as the perquisites provided to such executive
officer by previous employers. The perquisites available to the executive officers consist of: use of a company vehicle
 health
care benefits for the executive officer and his immediate family
 reimbursement of certain specified vacation expenses and life
insurance.

Equity
Plans

We
do not currently maintain any equity compensation plans for or provide any form of equity compensation to our executive officers.



On
August 27
 2009
 we entered into a Separation and Severance Agreement (the &ldquo;Separation Agreement&rdquo;) with Mr. Yashpal
Singh
 our President and Chief Executive Officer.

Pursuant
to the terms of the Separation Agreement
 upon Mr. Singh&rsquo;s (i) termination of employment for Good Reason (as defined in
the Separation Agreement)
 (ii) termination of employment at the end of the employment term
 (iii) death
 (iv) disability or (v)
termination by us without Cause (as defined in the Separation Agreement)
 he shall be entitled to certain severance benefits and
payments. The severance payment shall equal the product of (x) 2.5 times his average monthly base salary (calculated over the
twelve (12) month period preceding the termination event)
 multiplied by (y) the number of years (on a pro-rated basis) he had
been employed by us at the Termination Date (as defined in the Separation Agreement); provided
 however
 that the severance payment
may not exceed thirty (30) months of Mr. Singh&rsquo;s average monthly base salary (calculated over the twelve (12) months preceding
his termination date). In addition
 we agreed to pay COBRA premiums for Mr. Singh and his spouse until the earlier of (i) the
effective date on which he obtains comparable health insurance from a subsequent employer or (ii) eighteen (18) months following
his Termination Date. Mr. Singh shall also be entitled to accrued salary
 vacation time and benefits as set forth in Mr. Singh&rsquo;s
employment agreement.

If
Mr. Singh&rsquo;s employment is terminated without Cause
 in addition to the severance payment described above
 he shall also
receive either (i) 365 days prior written notice or (ii) a lump sum payment equal to twelve (12) months of his base salary at
the rate in place at the Termination Date (the &ldquo;Notice Payment&rdquo;).

In
case of Mr. Singh&rsquo;s resignation without Good Reason
 he shall be entitled to accrued salary
 vacation time and benefits
set forth in his employment agreement but shall not be entitled to the severance payment or the Notice Payment.

If
Mr. Singh is terminated by us for Cause
 he shall be entitled to (i) accrued salary
 vacation time and benefits as set forth in
his employment agreement and (ii) if we do not provide Mr. Singh at least twelve (12) months prior notice
 the Notice Payment.
Mr. Singh shall not be entitled to the severance payment in case of termination by MBC for Cause.

Payments
due to Mr. Singh under the Separation Agreement shall be paid in equal monthly installments by the Company over a 20 month period.
The receipt of payments is contingent on Mr. Singh executing a release of claims for the benefit of the Company.

For
purposes of illustrating the potential amounts payable to Mr. Singh under the Separation Agreement
 assuming a termination date
of March 31
 2016
 Mr. Singh would receive the following approximate amounts of compensation for the applicable triggering event:
termination by the Company for Cause - $319
200; completion of term of Employment Agreement - $798
100 plus COBRA payments; termination
due to disability or death - $798
100 plus COBRA payments; termination by Mr. Singh for Good Reason - $798
100 plus COBRA payments;
or termination by the Company without Cause - $1
117
300 plus COBRA payments.

Except
for the Employment Agreement and Separation Agreement with Mr. Singh and a similar arrangement (described below) with Mr. Mahadevan
Narayanan
 the Company&rsquo;s Chief Financial Officer and Secretary
 MBC does not currently maintain any other retirement plans
nor provide any post-retirement benefits to any employee or executive officer.


    
    



The
Company does not currently have an employment agreement in place with its Chief Financial Officer
 but may enter into an employment
agreement with such executive officer in the future.

Pursuant
to a resolution adopted on September 10
 2013 by the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors
 we entered into a Separation and Severance
Agreement (the &ldquo;CFO Separation Agreement&rdquo;) with Mr. Mahadevan Narayanan
 our Chief Financial Officer and Secretary
on April 12
 2016.

Pursuant
to the terms of the Separation Agreement
 upon Mr. Narayanan&rsquo;s (i) termination of employment for Good Reason (as defined
in the Separation Agreement)
 (ii) termination of employment at the end of the employment term
 (iii) death
 (iv) disability or
(v) termination by us without Cause (as defined in the Separation Agreement)
 he shall be entitled to certain severance benefits
and payments. The severance payment shall equal the product of (x) 2.5 times his average monthly base salary (calculated over
the twelve (12) month period preceding the termination event)
 multiplied by (y) the number of years (on a pro-rated basis) he
had been employed by us at the Termination Date (as defined in the Separation Agreement); provided
 however
 that the severance
payment may not exceed thirty (30) months of Mr. Narayanan&rsquo;s average monthly base salary (calculated over the twelve (12)
months preceding his termination date). In addition
 we agreed to pay COBRA premiums for Mr. Narayanan and his spouse until the
earlier of (i) the effective date on which he obtains comparable health insurance from a subsequent employer or (ii) eighteen
(18) months following his Termination Date.

If
Mr. Narayanan&rsquo;s employment is terminated without Cause
 in addition to the severance payment described above
 he shall also
receive either (i) 365 days prior written notice or (ii) a lump sum payment equal to twelve (12) months of his base salary at
the rate in place at the Termination Date (the &ldquo;Notice Payment&rdquo;).

In
case of Mr. Narayanan&rsquo;s resignation without Good Reason
 he shall be entitled to accrued salary
 vacation time and benefits
set forth in his employment agreement but shall not be entitled to the severance payment or the Notice Payment.

If
Mr. Narayanan is terminated by us for Cause
 he shall be entitled to (i) accrued salary
 vacation time and benefits through the
Termination Date and (ii) if we do not provide Mr. Narayanan at least twelve (12) months prior notice
 the Notice Payment. Mr.
Narayanan shall not be entitled to the severance payment in case of termination by MBC for Cause.

Payments
due to Mr. Narayanan under the Separation Agreement shall be paid in equal monthly installments by the Company over a 20 month
period. The receipt of payments is contingent on Mr. Narayanan executing a release of claims for the benefit of the Company.

For
purposes of illustrating the potential amounts payable to Mr. Narayanan under the Separation Agreement
 assuming a termination
date of March 31
 2016
 Mr. Narayanan would receive the following approximate amounts of compensation for the applicable triggering
event: termination by the Company for Cause - $181
100; termination due to disability or death - $452
800 plus COBRA payments;
termination by Mr. Narayanan for Good Reason - $452
800 plus COBRA payments; or termination by the Company without Cause - $633
900
plus COBRA payments.

The

ITEM
13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
 AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.

Since
the beginning of fiscal year 2012
 we were a participant in the following transactions in which (i) the amount involved exceeded
the lesser of (A) $120
000
 or (B) one percent of the average of our total assets at year-end for the last two completed fiscal
years and (ii) a related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest:

UBA
Line of Credit

On
August 31
 1999
 MBC and UBA
 one of our principal shareholders
 entered into a Master Line of Credit Agreement
 which was subsequently
amended in April 2000 and February 2001 (the &ldquo;Credit Agreement&rdquo;). The terms of the Credit Agreement provide us with
a line of credit in a principal amount of up to $1
600
000. We have executed an Extension of Term of Notes under the Master Line
of Credit Agreement (the &ldquo;Extension Agreement&rdquo;) with UBA. The UBA Notes have been extended until June 2012 with automatic
renewals after such maturity date for successive one year terms
 provided that either the Company or UBA may elect not to extend
the term upon written notice given to the other party no more than 60 days and no fewer than 30 days prior to the expiration of
such term. No notice of election not to extend the term was received prior to the expiration of the period ending June 30
 2015
so the current term has been extended until June 30
 2016.

We
have issued thirteen (13) promissory notes to UBA pursuant to the Credit Agreement between the Company and UBA and one note on
substantially similar terms to UBA
 but unrelated to the Credit Agreement
 between September 1999 and March 2005. On December
28
 2001
 we entered into a Confirmation of Waiver with UBA which confirmed that as of August 13
 2001
 UBA waived its rights
with regard to the conversion rate protection set forth in the UBA Notes then outstanding. Such waiver does not apply to the single
note issued to UBA on March 2
 2005 that was not related to the Credit Agreement. The aggregate outstanding principal amount of
the UBA Notes as of December 31
 2015 was $1
915
400
 and the accrued but unpaid interest thereon was equal to approximately $1
764
700
for a total amount due of $3
680
100.

The
outstanding principal amount of the notes and the unpaid interest thereon may be converted
 at UBA&rsquo;s discretion
 into shares
of our unregistered Common Stock at a conversion rate of $1.50 per share for the notes issued pursuant to the Credit Agreement
and $1.44 for the note issued on March 2
 2005. As of December 31
 2015
 the outstanding principal and interest on the UBA Notes
was convertible into approximately 2
471
800 shares of our Common Stock.

As
of February 29
 2016
 the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the UBA Notes was $1
915
400
 and the accrued but unpaid interest
thereon was equal to approximately $1
780
500. As of February 29
 2016
 the entire amount of the outstanding principal and accrued
but unpaid interest owed with respect to the UBA Notes was convertible into approximately 2
482
400 shares of our Common Stock.
As of February 29
 2016
 UBA beneficially owns approximately 24.5% of our outstanding Common Stock (excluding any shares issuable
upon the conversion of the notes issued to UBA). Our Chairman
 Dr. Vijay Mallya
 is also the Chairman of the board of directors
of UBA. During each of fiscal years 2015 and 2014
 the largest aggregate amount of principal outstanding was $1
915
400. No principal
or interest was paid during fiscal year 2015 or 2014.

License
Agreement

In
July 2001
 we entered into a Kingfisher Trademark and Trade Name License Agreement with Kingfisher America
 Inc.
 a Delaware corporation
affiliated with UB Limited
 pursuant to which we obtained a royalty-free
 exclusive license to use the Kingfisher trademark and
trade name in connection with the brewing and distribution of beer in the United States. This agreement will remain in effect
for as long as the Distribution Agreement (described below) between UBIUK and KBEL remains in effect. The Distribution Agreement
is scheduled to expire in October 2018. The Company has negotiated arrangements with Kingfisher America to continue to brew and
distribute beer in the United States using the Kingfisher trademark pursuant to the License Agreement. If the Company cannot obtain
the right to continue to brew and distribute beer using the Kingfisher trademark on commercially reasonable terms
 our results
of operations
 cash flows and financial position may be materially adversely affected.

Because
our Chairman of the Board
 Dr. Vijay Mallya
 is also the Chairman of the board of directors of UB Limited
 the transactions represented
by this license agreement may be deemed to be related party transactions.

The
dollar value of the license agreement cannot be accurately estimated.


    
    


Distribution
Agreement

UBIUK
entered into a Distribution Agreement with its wholly-owned subsidiary KBEL on October 9
 1998. Under this agreement
 which was
subsequently amended by a Supplemental Agreement dated as of October 24
 2001 and a deed of variation dated March 11
 2013 and
effective October 9
 2013 (together
 the &ldquo;Distribution Agreement&rdquo;)
 UBIUK granted KBEL an exclusive sublicense for
the distribution of all lager and other beer products brewed or prepared for sale in the Foreign Territory
 and a sublicense to
use the Kingfisher trademark and trade name
 to manufacture
 package
 market
 distribute
 and sell beer and other products using
the Kingfisher trademark and logo
 and to enter into the Brewing License Agreement described below. The Distribution Agreement
which also requires KBEL to pay UBIUK a royalty fee of 50 British pence (approximately $0.82 at the average exchange rates in
effect during fiscal year 2015) for every 100 liters (26 gallons) of beer brewed for sale in the Foreign Territory
 will expire
with respect to the Foreign Territory sublicense
 in October 2018. The royalty due to UBIUK for the year 2015 was approximately
$61
000 and for the year 2014 was approximately $67
700.

Brewing
License Agreement

Effective
October 26
 2001
 MBC entered into a Brewing License Agreement with KBEL in the United States
 under the terms of which KBEL granted
us an exclusive license to brew and distribute Kingfisher Premium Lager
 in exchange for a royalty
 payable to KBEL
 of eighty
cents ($0.80) for each case of Kingfisher Premium Lager sold by us under this agreement. The Brewing License Agreement expires
pursuant to its terms in October 2018. Pursuant to a deed of variation
 after October 9
 2013
 the royalty payable to KBEL was
reduced to $0.56 per US barrel. The royalty due to KBEL pursuant to the Brewing License Agreement for the year 2015 was approximately
$6
800 and for the year 2014 was approximately $6
400.

Brewing
Agreement

On
April 18
 2013
 KBEL and UBIUK entered into a Contract Brewing and Distribution Agreement (the &ldquo;Brewing Agreement&rdquo;)
with HUK. Affiliates of HUK are significant shareholders of UB Limited. In addition
 UB Limited has arrangements with affiliates
of HUK pursuant to which UB Limited brews Heineken beer for the Indian market. The Chairman of the board of directors of the Company
Dr. Vijay Mallya
 is also the Chairman of the board of directors of UB Limited.

Commencing
October 9
 2013
 the Brewing Agreement subcontracted to HUK the exclusive right to manufacture
 package and supply Kingfisher
beer for sale in the United Kingdom and to manufacture and package Kingfisher beer for export by KBEL to Europe (excluding Germany)
for a period of five years whereupon the Brewing Agreement will automatically terminate. In addition
 under the Brewing Agreement
in exchange for royalty payments to KBEL
 HUK received the right to be the sole and exclusive reseller of the Product (as defined
in the Brewing Agreement) to certain customers. If HUK fails to sell a specified amount to such customers
 KBEL will be entitled
to withdraw such exclusivity upon the terms provided in the Brewing Agreement. KBEL will continue to sell the Product purchased
from HUK to certain wholesale and on trade customers in the United Kingdom. HUK is entitled to terminate the Brewing Agreement
on thirty days&rsquo; notice upon a change of control of KBEL
 or immediately upon the occurrence
 and failure to rectify within
30 days
 of an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default (as such terms are defined in the HUK Loan Agreement
 described
below). KBEL purchased beer from HUK for the amount of $11
713
300 during the year 2015 and $12
884
700 in the year 2014. Royalty
fees receivable from HUK in 2015were $68
700 and in 2014 were $61
800.

HUK
Loan Agreement

On
April 18
 2013
 KBEL entered into a loan agreement with HUK pursuant to which HUK provided KBEL with a secured term loan facility
of &pound;1
000
000 on October 9
 2013. The loan has to be repaid in twelve equal quarterly installments commencing from January
9
 2014. Interest on the loan will accrue from day to day and is calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed
and a year of 365 days. Such interest is payable quarterly in arrears on the outstanding balance of the loan at the rate of 5%
above the Bank of England base rate. Prepayment is permitted. Upon an Event of Default
 as defined in the loan agreement
 if HUK
and KBEL fail to agree on a payment plan acceptable to HUK
 HUK may
 among other remedies
 declare the loan immediately due and
repayable or exercise its right to an exclusive license pursuant to the Sub-Licence Agreement described and defined below. The
largest amount of principal outstanding under the loan agreement in 2015 and 2014 was &pound;666
700 and &pound;1
000
000 respectively.
The amount of principal outstanding as of March 27
 2016 was &pound;250
000. Principal and interest repayments in 2015 were &pound;333
300
and &pound;25
400 respectively. Principal and interest repayments in 2014 were &pound;333
300 and &pound;56
900 respectively.


    
    


Sub-Licence
Agreement

On
April 18
 2013
 HUK
 UBIUK
 KBEL and UB Limited entered into that certain Heineken Sub-Licence Agreement (the &ldquo;Sub-Licence
Agreement&rdquo;) pursuant to which HUK has the option
 exercisable upon a default or breach by KBEL under the Brewing Agreement
or the loan agreement with HUK described above or a change of control or bankruptcy of KBEL
 to acquire an exclusive license from
UBIUK to produce
 market and sell Kingfisher beer in the United Kingdom. Such license would expire on the earlier of the date
certain debts (the &ldquo;Debt&rdquo;) between HUK and KBEL are settled
 and October 9
 2018. As consideration for such exclusive
license
 HUK would reduce the Debt pursuant to the terms of the Sub-Licence Agreement. HUK may terminate the Sub-Licence Agreement
upon a material breach by UBIUK
 after notice and a thirty day cure period
 or
 immediately upon the termination of UBIUK&rsquo;s
license pursuant to its agreement with UB Limited. Upon termination of the Sub-Licence Agreement
 the Debt shall become immediately
due and payable. HUK&rsquo;s aggregate liability for breaches of the Sub-Licence Agreement is capped.

The
dollar value of the Sub-Licence Agreement cannot be accurately estimated.

MBC&rsquo;s
two largest shareholders are UBA
 which owns 24.5% of MBC&rsquo;s Common Stock
 and Inversiones
 which owns 43.6% of MBC&rsquo;s
Common Stock. UBHL is the ultimate beneficial owner of UBA and Inversiones because both UBA and Inversiones are controlled by
Rigby International Corp
 a wholly-owned subsidiary of UBHL.

MBC
received a letter dated November 11
 2013 from UBHL
 MBC&rsquo;s indirect majority shareholder
 dated November 11
 2013. The chairman
of MBC&rsquo;s Board
 Dr. Vijay Mallya
 is also the chairman of the board of directors of UBHL. In the letter
 UBHL sets forth
its understanding that its investment in MBC will allow MBC to reach certain goals. In light of such understanding
 UBHL is willing
to commit to invest $2
000
000 in MBC in four installments to be paid every six months over a two year period. The letter does
not state definitive terms for the proposed investment. Pursuant to this letter
 UBHL will consider additional investment based
on a business plan to be provided by MBC.

On
January 22
 2014
 MBC issued a promissory note to Catamaran in the principal amount of $500
000. Catamaran Holdings
 Ltd.
 the
sole shareholder of Catamaran
 has directors in common with Inversiones
 one of the major shareholders of MBC. The indirect beneficial
owner of Inversiones is UBHL. Dr. Vijay Mallya
 the Chairman of the board of directors of the Company is also the Chairman of
the board of directors of UBHL. On April 24
 2014
 the Company issued another note to Catamaran in the principal amount of $500
000
on terms similar to the note issued on January 22
 2014. On February 5
 2015
 the Company issued a third note to Catamaran in
the principal amount of $500
000 on terms similar to the notes issued earlier. On June 30
 2015
 the Company issued a fourth note
to Catamaran in the principal amount of $500
000 on terms similar to the notes issued earlier
 the proceeds of which were received
by the Company on July 6
 2015.

Pursuant
to the terms of each note
 MBC promises to pay the principal sum with accrued interest
 as described below
 to Catamaran within
six months following the date of each note
 subject to the receipt by MBC of a Shareholder Investment in an amount sufficient
either (a) to pay all the notes through Permitted Payments
 as defined below
 or (b) to pay all the notes together with certain
existing obligations of MBC to MB Financial pursuant to the Credit and Security Agreement dated as of June 23
 2011 (as amended
modified or supplemented from time to time) among MBC
 Releta
 and MB Financial in full. &ldquo;Permitted Payments&rdquo; are
payments made from the Shareholder Investment.

On
March 14
 2016
 a fifth note was issued by the Company in the principal amount of $325
000 to Catamaran on terms substantially
similar to the previous notes
 except that the definition of &ldquo;Permitted Payment&rdquo; was revised to mean
 for purposes
of this fifth note
 a payment made from a bridge loan by the Company&rsquo;s majority shareholder in excess of $600
000. On March
30
 2016
 a sixth note was issued by the Company in the principal amount of $75
000 to Catamaran on terms substantially similar
to the fifth note.

Pursuant
to the terms of the fifth and sixth notes
 the Company promises to pay the principal sum of $325
000 and $75
000 respectively
with accrued interest
 as described below
 to Catamaran within six months following the dates of the such notes
 subject to the
&rdquo;) in an amount
sufficient either (a) to pay such notes through Permitted Bridge Loan Payments
 or (b) to pay both the notes and certain existing
obligations of the Company to the Lender in full.


    
    


If
MBC is not able to satisfy its obligations on any Catamaran Note within six month following the date of such Catamaran Note
 the
Catamaran Note shall be automatically extended for additional six month terms until a Permitted Payment (for the first through
fourth notes) or Permitted Bridge Loan Payment (for the fifth and sixth notes)
 as the case may be
 can be made or such note is
otherwise paid. Interest shall accrue from the date of the Catamaran Note on the unpaid principal at a rate equal to the lesser
of (i) one and one-half percent (1.5%) per annum above the prime rate offered from time to time by the Bank of America Corporation
in San Francisco
 California
 or (ii) ten percent (10%) per annum
 until the principal is fully paid.

The
Catamaran Notes may be prepaid without penalty at the option of MBC; however
 no payments on the Catamaran Note may be made unless
such payment is a Permitted Payment (the first through fourth notes)
 Permitted Bridge Loan Payment (the fifth and sixth notes)
as the case may be
 or certain existing obligations of MBC to MB Financial pursuant to the Agreement have been satisfied in full.
The Catamaran Notes may not be amended without the prior written consent of MB Financial.

No
interest has yet been paid on the Catamaran Notes; the largest aggregate amount of principal outstanding under the Catamaran Notes
as of December 31
 2015 and 2014 were $2
000
000 and $1
000
000 respectively. As of March31
 2016
the amount of principal outstanding
was $2
400
000.

DIRECTOR
INDEPENDENCE

The
Board has determined that the following directors qualify as &ldquo;independent&rdquo; in accordance with the published listing
requirements of NASDAQ: Mr. Cannata
 Mr. Grossman
 Mr. Heldfond
 Mr. Laybourn
 Mr. Palamand
 Mr. Merchant and Mr. Price. Mr. Singh
is not &ldquo;independent&rdquo; because he is an employee of MBC. Dr. Mallya is not independent since he has received payments
in excess of the applicable threshold from the Company during the last three (3) years. Prior to 2007
 Mr. Merchant provided certain
consulting services to the Company
 however
 given the timing and nature of such services as well as the amount of compensation
provided in relation thereto
 the Board has determined that Mr. Merchant meets the criteria for being an &ldquo;independent director&rdquo;.

The
NASDAQ rules contain both objective tests and a subjective test for determining who is an &ldquo;independent director.&rdquo;
The objective tests provide that a director is not considered independent if he (i) is an employee of the Company (or a parent
or subsidiary) (or has been in the past three (3) years); (ii) has accepted (or a family member has accepted) compensation from
the Company in excess of $120
000 during any period of twelve (12) consecutive months within the preceding three (3) year period
(subject to certain exceptions); (iii) has a family member that was employed as an executive officer of the Company (or a parent
or subsidiary) during the past three (3) years; (iv) is (or a family member is) a controlling shareholder or an executive officer
of an organization to which the Company made or received payments in the current year or at any time during the past three (3)
years that exceed the greater of (a) five percent (5%) of the recipient&rsquo;s consolidated gross revenues or (b) $200
000 for
that year; (v) is (or has a family member who is) employed as an executive officer of another entity where at any time during
the past three (3) years any of the executive officers of the Company served on the compensation committee of such other entity;
or (vi) is (or has a family member who is) a current partner of the Company&rsquo;s outside auditor who worked on the Company&rsquo;s
audit at any time during any of the past three (3) years. The subjective test is based on the standard that an independent director
must be a person who lacks a relationship that
 in the opinion of the Board
 would interfere with the exercise of independent
judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.

Please
see additional disclosure set forth under the heading &ldquo;Board of Directors&rsquo; and Committee Meetings&rdquo; above.

The
Board of Directors does not have a nominating committee or a committee performing similar functions. Instead
 all of the Directors
participate in the director nomination process. As discussed above
 Mr. Singh and Dr. Mallya are not &ldquo;independent&rdquo;
directors under the NASDAQ standards for independence.

COMPANY

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


Board
of Directors and Stockholders of
Mendocino
Brewing Company
 Inc. and Subsidiaries
Ukiah
California

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mendocino Brewing Company
 Inc. and subsidiaries (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;)
as of December 31
 2015 and 2014
 and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss)
 changes
in stockholders&rsquo; equity
 and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits include consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
 but not for expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining
 on a test basis
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion
 the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the consolidated
financial position of Mendocino Brewing Company
 Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December&nbsp;31
 2015 and 2014 and the consolidated
results of their operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31
 2015 and 2014 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the financial statements
 the Company has secured lines-of-credit and secured notes payable with an aggregate principal
balance of and $1
663
400 and&nbsp;$3
378
600
 respectively
 which are due starting from May 31
 2016. The Company does not generate
sufficient cash flow from operations and has not secured additional financing to meet these obligations when they are due. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management&rsquo;s plans regarding those
matters also are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty.

Description
of Operations

Mendocino
Brewing Company
 Inc.
 was formed in 1983 in California
 and has two operating subsidiaries: Releta Brewing Company
 LLC
 (&ldquo;Releta&rdquo;)
and United Breweries International (UK) Limited (&ldquo;UBIUK&rdquo;). In the United States (&ldquo;US&rdquo;)
 MBC and its subsidiary
Releta
 operate two breweries that produce beer for the specialty &ldquo;craft&rdquo; segment of the beer market. The breweries
are located in Ukiah
 California and Saratoga Springs
 New York. The majority of sales for Mendocino Brewing Company in the US
are in California. The Company brews several brands
 of which Red Tail Ale is the flagship brand. In addition
 the Company performs
contract brewing for several other brands
 and MBC holds the license to distribute Kingfisher Premium Lager Beer in the US and
Canada. Generally
 product shipments are made directly from the breweries to the wholesalers or distributors in accordance with
state and local laws. In these notes
 the term &ldquo;the Company&rdquo; and its variants and the terms &ldquo;we
&rdquo; &ldquo;us
&rdquo;
and &ldquo;our&rdquo; and their variants are generally used to refer to Mendocino Brewing Company
 Inc. together with its subsidiaries
while the term &ldquo;MBC&rdquo; is used to refer to Mendocino Brewing Company
 Inc. as an individual entity.

The
Company&rsquo;s United Kingdom (&ldquo;UK&rdquo;) subsidiary
 UBIUK
 is a holding company for Kingfisher Beer Europe Limited (&ldquo;KBEL&rdquo;).
KBEL is a distributor of Kingfisher Premium Lager Beer
 in the United Kingdom and Europe. The distributorship is located in Maidstone
Kent in the UK.

Subsequent
Events

The
Company evaluates events that occur subsequent to the balance sheet date of periodic reports
 but before financial statements
are issued for periods ending on such balance sheet dates
 for possible adjustment to such financial statements or other disclosure.
This evaluation generally occurs through the date at which the Company&rsquo;s financial statements are electronically prepared
for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;).

Principles
of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements present the accounts of Mendocino Brewing Company
 Inc.
 and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
Releta and UBIUK. All material intracompany and inter-company balances
 profits and transactions have been eliminated.

Basis
of Presentation and Organization

The
financial statements for the years ended December 31
 2015 and 2014 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. The financial statements and notes are representations of the management and the Board
of Directors
 who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity.



Certain
items in the financial statements for the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These
reclassifications had no effect on net income or equity.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents
 Short- and Long-Term Investments

For
purposes of cash flows
 the Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less
to be cash equivalents.

Foreign
Operations

Approximately
27% of the Company&rsquo;s assets are located in the UK. Although this country is considered economically stable and the Company
has experienced no notable burden from foreign exchange transactions
 export duties
 or government regulations
 it is always possible
that unanticipated events in foreign countries could disrupt the Company&rsquo;s operations.

Trade
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Trade
accounts receivable are stated at the invoiced amount and are the amount the Company expects to collect. Sales are made to approved
customers on an open account basis
 subject to established credit limits
 and generally no collateral is required. The allowance
for doubtful accounts is the Company&rsquo;s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Company&rsquo;s existing
accounts receivable; however
 changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional
allowances in the future.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts 

The
Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make
required payments. Management considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts:
customer credit-worthiness
 past transaction history with the customer
 current economic and industry trends and changes in customer
payment terms. Past due balances over 90 days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectability. If the
financial condition of the Company&rsquo;s customers were to deteriorate
 adversely affecting their ability to make payments
additional allowances would be required. Based on management&rsquo;s assessment
 the Company provides for estimated uncollectible
amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company
has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable.
The Company had allowances of $69
100 and $56
700 for doubtful accounts receivable as of December 31
 2015 and 2014
 respectively.



Inventories
are stated at the lower of average cost
 which approximates the first-in
 first-out method
 or market (net realizable value).
The Company regularly reviews its inventories for the presence of obsolete product attributed to age
 seasonality and quality.
Inventories that are considered obsolete are written off or adjusted to carrying value.

Prepaid
Expenses and Other Assets 

Prepaid
expenses and other assets generally consist of deposits
 other receivables
 and prepayments for future services. Prepayments are
expensed when the services are received.

Property
and Equipment 

Property
and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over the assets&rsquo; estimated
useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the life of the improvement or the life of the related
lease. The Company uses other depreciation methods (generally
 accelerated depreciation methods) for tax purposes where appropriate.
Costs of maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred; significant renewals and betterments are capitalized. When
property and equipment are retired
 sold
 or otherwise disposed of
 the asset&rsquo;s carrying amount and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the statement of operations.

Estimated
useful lives of property and equipment are as follows:



    
    
40
    years

Machinery
    and equipment
    
3
    - 40 years

    - 10 years

Assets
Held under Capital Leases 

Assets
held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of
the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter
of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets

The
Company assesses the impairment of its long-lived assets periodically in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards
Codification (ASC) 360
 (Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets). The Company reviews the carrying value
of property and equipment and any other long-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate
that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use
and eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value
 an impairment
loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets. The factors considered by
management in performing this assessment include current operating results
 trends
 and prospects
 as well as the effects of obsolescence
demand
 competition
 and other economic factors. Long-lived assets that management commits to sell or abandon are reported at
the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Deferred
Financing Costs

Costs
relating to obtaining financing are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related debt. When a loan is paid in full
any unamortized financing costs are removed from the related accounts and charged to operations. Deferred financing costs related
to borrowing made in June 2011 were $225
000. Amortization of deferred financing costs charged to operations was $45
000 for the
years ended December 31
 2015 and 2014.

Income
Taxes

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 750 which requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting
and reporting for income taxes and allows recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization
of tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and liability approach
 deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of
temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
used for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are recognized
for deductible temporary differences and operating loss
 and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established to
reduce the deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.

The
Company periodically assesses uncertain tax positions that the Company has taken or expects to take on a tax return (including
a decision whether to file or not to file a return in a particular jurisdiction). The Company evaluated its tax positions and
determined that there were no uncertain tax benefits for the years ending December 31
 2015 and 2014.

Revenue
Recognition

The
Company recognizes revenue from brewing and distribution operations in accordance with ASC 605. The Company recognizes revenue
from product sales
 net of discounts.

The
Company recognizes revenue only when all of the following criteria have been met:



    
Persuasive
    evidence of an arrangement exists;

    
    

    
Delivery
    has occurred or services have been rendered;

    
    

    
The
    fee for the arrangement is fixed or determinable; and

    
    

    
Collectability
    is reasonably assured.



    
    


Mendocino

Notes

 2015 and 2014

&ldquo;Persuasive
Evidence of an Arrangement&rdquo; &ndash; 
order signed by the customer prior to recognizing revenue.

&ldquo;Delivery
Has Occurred or Services Have Been Performed&rdquo; &ndash;
or performs services as per contractual terms. Product is considered delivered upon delivery to a customer&rsquo;s designated
location and services are considered performed upon completion of Company&rsquo;s contractual obligations.

&ldquo;The
Fee for the Arrangement is Fixed or Determinable&rdquo; &ndash;
 an amount is either fixed or
determinable under the terms of the written contract or purchase order. The price is negotiated at the outset of the arrangement
and is not subject to refund or adjustment during the initial term of the arrangement.

&ldquo;Collectability
is Reasonably Assured&rdquo; &ndash;
revenue. Collectability is assessed on a customer-by-customer basis based on criteria outlined by management. The Company does
not enter into arrangements unless collectability is reasonably assured at the outset. Existing customers are subject to ongoing
credit evaluations based on payment history and other factors. If it is determined during the arrangement that collectability
is not reasonably assured
 revenue is recognized on a cash basis.

The
Company records certain consideration paid to customers for services or placement fees as a reduction in revenue rather than as
an expense. The Company reports these items on the statement of operations as a reduction in revenue and as a corresponding reduction
in marketing and selling expenses.

Revenues
from the brewpub and gift store are recognized when sales have been completed.

Excise
Taxes 

The
federal government levies excise taxes on the sale of alcoholic beverages
 including beer. For brewers producing less than 2.0
million barrels of beer per calendar year
 the federal excise tax is $7 per barrel on the first 60
000 barrels of beer removed
for consumption or sale during a calendar year
 and $18 per barrel for each barrel in excess of 60
000. Individual states also
impose excise taxes on alcoholic beverages in varying amounts
 which have also been subject to change. Sales as presented in the
Company&rsquo;s statements of operations reflect the amount invoiced to the Company&rsquo;s wholesalers and other customers. Excise
taxes due to federal and state agencies are not collected from the Company&rsquo;s customers
 but rather are the responsibility
of the Company. Net sales
 as presented in the Company&rsquo;s statements of operations
 are reduced by applicable federal and
state excise taxes. In the UK
 excise taxes are paid by the manufacturer and not by the Company.



To
further promote retail sales of its products and in response to local competitive conditions
 the Company regularly offers price
discounts to distributors and retailers in most of its markets. Sales for the years 2015 and 2014
 as presented in the Company&rsquo;s
statements of operations
 are reduced by $1
204
400 and $1
140
800 respectively
 related to such discounts.

Chargebacks
and Sales Reserves 

The
Company has estimated reserves for chargebacks for promotional expenses by distributors. The Company estimates its reserves by
utilizing historical information and current contracts. In estimating chargeback reserves
 the Company analyzes actual chargeback
amounts and applies historical chargeback rates to estimate potential chargeback. The Company routinely assesses its experience
with distributors and adjusts the reserves accordingly. If actual chargebacks and other rebates are greater than the Company&rsquo;s
estimates
 additional reserves may be required. Revisions to estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts
that give rise to the revision become known.

Seasonality


Sales
of the Company&rsquo;s products are somewhat seasonal
 with the first and fourth quarters historically being the slowest and the
rest of the year generating stronger sales. The volume of sales may also be affected by weather conditions. Because of the seasonality
of the Company&rsquo;s business
 results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved
for the full fiscal year.

Taxes
Collected From Customers

Taxes
collected from customers and remitted to tax authorities are sales tax collected from our retail customers. State and federal
excise taxes on beer shipments are the responsibility of the Company and included in our selling price. Excise taxes on shipments
are shown in a separate line item in the consolidated statement of operations as reduction of gross sales. Sales taxes collected
from customers are recognized as a liability
 with the liability subsequently reduced when the taxes are remitted to the tax authority.
Total sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to tax authorities were not material in 2015 and 2014.

Delivery
Costs

In
accordance with ASC 605
 (Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs) the company reports pass-through freight costs on beer shipped
to independent beer wholesalers in cost of sales. Reimbursements of these costs by wholesalers are reported in sales.

Non-pass-through
costs incurred by the Company to deliver beer to wholesalers are included in marketing
 distribution and administrative expenses.
These costs are considered marketing related because in addition to product delivery
 wholesalers provide marketing and other
customer service functions to customers including product display
 shelf space management
 distribution of promotional materials
and product rotation. Shipping costs included in marketing expense totaled $968
200 and $1
051
300
 for the years ended December
31
 2015 and 2014
 respectively.

Basic
and Diluted Income per Share

The
basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the earnings attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. In 2015
 the effect of any potentially dilutive securities would have been anti-dilutive.
Therefore
 the conversion of the related party notes has been excluded from the calculation of net earnings per share for the
year ended December 31
 2015. Basic net earnings per share exclude the dilutive effect of stock options or warrants and convertible
notes. The computations of basic and dilutive net earnings per share are as follows:

Foreign
Currency Translation

The
Company has subsidiaries located in the UK
 where the local currency
 UK Pound Sterling
 is the functional currency. Financial
statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and
average exchange rates during the period for revenues and expenses. Cumulative translation adjustments associated with net assets
or liabilities are reported in non-owner changes in equity. Any exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions
are recognized in the income statement as incurred
 in the same financial statement caption as the underlying transaction
 and
are not material for any year shown.

Cash
at UBIUK was translated at exchange rates in effect at December 31
 2015 and 2014
 and its cash flows were translated at the average
exchange rates for the years then ended. Changes in cash resulting from the translations are presented as a separate item in the
statements of cash flows.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
includes having the Company make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets
 liabilities
 revenues and
expenses
 and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The amounts estimated could differ from actual results. Significant
estimates include
 allowance for doubtful accounts
 depreciation and amortization periods
 and the future utilization of deferred
tax assets.



Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred and were $903
600 and $987
500for the years ended December 31
 2015 and 2014
 respectively.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

Fair
Value

The
fair value of the Company&rsquo;s financial instruments reflects the amounts that the Company estimates to receive in connection
with the sale of an asset or paid in connection with the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date (exit price). For financial assets and liabilities that are periodically re-measured to fair value
 the
Company discloses a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation techniques into the following three
levels:

Level
1 &ndash; quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

Level
2 &ndash; observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

Level
3 &ndash; unobservable inputs.

At
December 31
 2015 and 2014
 the Company had no financial assets or liabilities that required periodic re-measurement at fair value.

The
recorded value of certain financial assets and liabilities
 which consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents
 accounts receivable
other current assets
 accounts payable and accrued expenses
 approximate the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities
at December 31
 2015 and December 31
 2014 based upon the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities. Based on borrowing
rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms
 the carrying value of short and long term notes payable
approximate fair value.

Comprehensive
Income

Comprehensive
income is composed of the Company&rsquo;s net income and changes in equity from all other non-stockholder sources. The changes
from these non-stockholder sources are reflected as a separate item in the statements of operations and comprehensive income.

Reportable
Segments

The
Company manages its operations through two business segments: (i) brewing operations
 tavern and tasting room operations in the
US and Canada (the &ldquo;North American Territory&rdquo;) and (ii) distributor operations in Europe (including Austria
 Belgium
Denmark
 Ireland
 Italy
 the Netherlands
 France
 Finland
 Germany
 Greece
 Iceland
 Liechtenstein
 Luxembourg
 Norway
 Portugal
Spain
 Sweden
 Switzerland
 and the United Kingdom) (the &ldquo;Foreign Territory&rdquo;). The Company evaluates performance based
on net operating profit. Where applicable
 portions of the administrative function expenses are allocated between the operating
segments. The operating segments do not share manufacturing or distribution facilities. In the event any materials and/or services
are provided to one operating segment by the other
 the transaction is valued according to the Company&rsquo;s transfer policy
which approximates market price. The costs of operating the manufacturing plants are captured discretely within each segment.
The Company&rsquo;s property
 plant and equipment
 inventory
 and accounts receivable are captured and reported discretely within
each operating segment.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

During
the fourth quarter of 2014
 the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (&ldquo;ASU&rdquo;) 2014-08
 &ldquo;Presentation of
Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property
 Plant and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures
of Disposals of Components of an Entity
&rdquo; which changes the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as
discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements. This ASU was effective for fiscal years beginning on or
after December 15
 2014
 and interim periods within those years. Early adoption was permitted
 but only for disposals (or classifications
as held for sale) that had not been reported in the financial statements previously issued or available for issuance. See Notes
X for disclosures related to this adoption.

During
the first quarter of 2015
 the company adopted FASB&rsquo;s guidance on reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals
of components of an entity. This standard raises the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires
new disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued
operation. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15
 2014. Early adoption was permitted
but only for disposals that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued. The adoption of this guidance has
not had a material impact on its financial position
 results of operations or cash flows.

In
January 2016
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01
which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current
guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
 and the presentation
and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition
 the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance
assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new
standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 and upon adoption
 an entity should
apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period
in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for
financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.

In
November 2015
 the FASB issued (ASU) 2015-17
 Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. Currently deferred taxes for each
tax jurisdiction are presented as a net current asset or liability and net noncurrent asset or liability on the balance sheet.
To simplify the presentation
 the new guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets for all jurisdictions along with
any related valuation allowances be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This guidance is
effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 and early adoption is permitted. The Company
has adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31
 2015 on a retrospective basis. The adoption of
this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s financial position
 results of operations or cash flows
 and
did not have any effect on prior periods due to the full valuation allowance against the Company&rsquo;s net deferred tax assets.

In
September 2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-16
 Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement &ndash;Period Adjustments. Changes to
the accounting for measurement-period adjustments relate to business combinations. Currently
 an acquiring entity is required
to retrospectively adjust the balance sheet amounts of the acquiree recognized at the acquisition date with a corresponding adjustment
to goodwill as a result of changes made to the balance sheet amounts of the acquiree. The measurement period is the period after
the acquisition date during which the acquirer may adjust the balance sheet amounts recognized for a business combination (generally
up to one year from the date of acquisition). The changes eliminate the requirement to make such retrospective adjustments
 and
instead require the acquiring entity to record these adjustments in the reporting period they are determined. The new standard
is effective for both public and private companies for periods beginning after December 15
 2015. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of adopting this guidance.

In
July 2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-11
 &ldquo;Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory
&rdquo; which applies
to inventory that is measured using first-in
 first-out (&ldquo;FIFO&rdquo;) or average cost. Under the updated guidance
 an entity
should measure inventory that is within scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value
 which is the estimated selling prices
in the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal and transportation. Subsequent measurement
is unchanged for inventory that is measured using last-in
 first-out (&ldquo;LIFO&rdquo;). This ASU is effective for annual and
interim periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 and should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted at the beginning
of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.

In
May 2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-07
 &ldquo;Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities
That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)
&rdquo; which removes the requirement to categorize within the fair
value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Further
the amendments remove the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair
value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. This ASU is effective for annual periods
 including interim periods
within those annual periods
 beginning after December 15
 2015
 and early adoption is permitted. The new guidance should be applied
on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.

In
April 2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-05
 &ldquo;Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer&rsquo;s
Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement
&rdquo; which provides guidance about whether a cloud computing arrangement
includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license
 the customer should account for the
software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement
does not include a software license
 the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. This ASU is effective
for annual periods
 including interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December 15
 2015
 and early adoption
is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.

In
April 2015
 the FASB issued guidance related to a customer&rsquo;s accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement.
This standard provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud

The
Credit and Security Agreement requires MBC and Releta to maintain certain minimum fixed charge coverage ratios for trailing twelve
month periods and minimum tangible net worth. The minimum tangible net worth MBC and Releta are required to maintain is subject
to increase based on the net income of MBC and Releta. On March 29
 2013
 MBC
 Releta
 and Lender entered into a First Amendment
to the Credit and Security Agreement to clarify the method by which the fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated
 with retrospective
application.

The
required fixed charge coverage ratio for the trailing twelve month periods ended March 31
 2013 onwards fell short of the required
ratio. The tangible net worth fell short of the required amount for the period beginning June 1
 2013 onwards.

On
September 18
 2013
 MBC and Releta received a notice (the &ldquo;Default Notice&rdquo;) from Lender regarding its intention to
exercise certain rights with respect to events of default of the Company pursuant to the Credit and Security Agreement.

The
Credit and Security Agreement provides that the failure of MBC and Releta to observe any covenant will constitute an event of
default under the Credit and Security Agreement. Under the Credit and Security Agreement
 upon the occurrence of an event of default
all of MBC&rsquo;s and Releta&rsquo;s obligations under the Credit and Security Agreement may
 at the option of the Lender
 be
declared
 and immediately shall become
 due and payable
 without notice of any kind. The event of default shall be deemed continuing
until waived in writing by the Lender. The Default Notice states that Lender has elected
 effective September 1
 2013
 to charge
a default interest rate equal to two percent (2%) per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable under the Credit
and Security Agreement. The Company estimates that the increased rate currently results in approximately $120
000 additional annual
interest expense.

On
April 18
 2014
 MBC and Releta received a second notice (the &ldquo;Second Default Notice&rdquo;) from Lender regarding its intention
to exercise certain rights with respect to events of default of the Company pursuant to the Credit and Security Agreement. The
Second Default Notice required MBC and Releta to engage a consultant to perform a viability analysis and prepare a revised projection
for 2014.

Effective
August 20
 2014
 pursuant to a notice to MBC and Releta dated August 18
 2014 (the &ldquo;Third Default Notice&rdquo;) which referred
to MBC&rsquo;s and Releta&rsquo;s continued failure to meet the required fixed charge coverage ratio and the tangible net worth
requirement
 Lender notified MBC and Releta that it would reduce the advance rate for (i) eligible finished goods and raw material
inventory and (ii) eligible work-in progress inventory by 2% each month. The advance rates are used in the calculation of the
borrowing base of each of MBC and Releta
 which is used in the determination of the amount available to each of MBC and Releta
pursuant to the revolving facility. Under the terms of the Credit and Security Agreement
 if such availability is less than $0
or if certain components of the borrowing base of each of MBC and Releta fall below certain limits in relation to outstanding
revolving loans
 such difference shall be immediately due and payable.

On
January 21
 2015
 MBC
 Releta
 and Lender entered into a Second Amendment (the &ldquo;Second Amendment&rdquo;) to the Credit and
Security Agreement. The Second Amendment reduced the maximum amount of the Revolver from $4
119
000 to $2
500
000. The Second
Amendment also changed the definition of borrowing base (including by lowering certain advance rates) such that the calculation
of the borrowing base will result in a lower number than it would have if calculated prior to the effectiveness of the Second
Amendment. The borrowing base is used in the determination of the amount available to each borrower (a &ldquo;Borrower&rdquo;)
pursuant to the Revolver. Pursuant to the Credit and Security Agreement
 if such availability is less than $0
 or if certain components
of the borrowing base fall below certain limits in relation to outstanding revolving loans
 such difference shall be immediately
due and payable.

The
Second Amendment reduced the advance rate for (i) eligible finished goods and raw material inventory and (ii) eligible work-in
progress inventory by two percent (2%) and continues to reduce each by an additional two percent (2%) on the 20th day of each
month thereafter. The advance rates are used in the calculation of the borrowing base of each Borrower
 which is used in the determination
of the amount available to each Borrower pursuant to the Revolver. As stated above
 if such availability is less than $0
 or if
certain components of the borrowing base fall below certain limits in relation to outstanding revolving loans
 such difference
shall be immediately due and payable.

Lender
has not waived the events of default described in the Default Notice
 the Second Default Notice or the Third Default Notice and
has reserved the right to all other available rights and remedies under the Credit and Security Agreement
 certain other related
documents and applicable law. Lender could declare the full amount owed under the Credit and Security Agreement due and payable
at any time for any reason or no reason. Since receiving the Second Amendment
 the Company has not received any notice or other
communication from Lender that it intends to exercise any other remedies available to it under the Credit and Security Agreement
in connection with the events of default. Lender continues to charge a default interest rate equal to two percent (2%) per annum
in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable under the Credit and Security Agreement. The exercise of additional remedies
by Lender may have a material adverse effect on the Company&rsquo;s financial condition and the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue
to operate. If it becomes necessary for MBC and Releta to seek additional financing
 there is no guarantee that MBC and Releta
will be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to the Company or on any terms.

On

 2015
 KBEL received a notice from Royal Bank of Scotland (&ldquo;RBS)&rdquo; regarding its intention to terminate
the credit line and all other banking services it currently provides to KBEL on February 26
 2016. RBS subsequently extended the
termination date to May 31
 2016. We have engaged in discussions with a bank which provided an indicative offer to provide a replacement
for the RBS line of credit. It would have a material adverse effect on KBEL and the Company if KBEL is unable to find a substitute
replacement before termination of the RBS facilities.

Pursuant
to a letter from UBHL dated November 11
 2013
 UBHL indicated a willingness to invest up to $2
000
000 in the Company. On January
22
 2014
 Catamaran Services
 Inc.
 (&ldquo;Catamaran&rdquo;)
 a related party (see &ldquo;Notes Payable to Related Party&rdquo;
below)
 provided a note loan of $500
000 repayable upon receipt of an equity investment by the Company&rsquo;s majority shareholder.
On April 24
 2014
 another note loan of $500
000 was received from Catamaran on terms similar to the previous note. On February
5
 2015
 another note loan of $500
000 was received from Catamaran on terms similar to the previous notes. On July 6
 2015
 the
proceeds of another note loan of $500
000 was received from Catamaran on terms similar to the previous notes. On each date on
or prior to which Catamaran provided a note loan
 the Company received a letter from Lender permitting the Company to obtain loans
subject to certain conditions
 including that no portion of such loans would be payable until either (a) certain obligations of
the Company to Lender pursuant to the Agreement were satisfied in full
 or (b) such payment was made from an equity investment
by the Company&rsquo;s majority shareholder.

In
response to the losses incurred in connection with the Company&rsquo;s operations
 UBHL
 the Company&rsquo;s indirect majority
shareholder
 issued a letter of comfort on March 5
 2015 (the &ldquo;Letter of Comfort&rdquo;)
 to confirm that UBHL had agreed
to provide funding on an as needed basis to ensure that the Company is able to meet its financial obligations as and when they
fall due. The Letter of Comfort does not specify either the terms of UBHL&rsquo;s support
 or a maximum dollar limit and is not
a legally binding agreement. However
 to date UBHL through its affiliated company
 Catamaran
 has provided funds for working capital
needs. UBHL&rsquo;s financial support is contingent upon compliance with any applicable exchange control requirements
 other applicable
laws
 and regulations relating to the transfer of funds from India. The Letter of Comfort does not specify any time limit for
extending support. If it becomes necessary to seek UBHL&rsquo;s financial assistance under the Letter of Comfort and UBHL is either
unable or unwilling to provide such financial assistance to MBC
 it may result in a material adverse effect on the Company&rsquo;s
financial position and on its ability to continue operations. UBHL controls the Company&rsquo;s two largest shareholders
 United
Breweries of America
 Inc. (&ldquo;UBA&rdquo;) and Inversiones
 and as such
 is the Company&rsquo;s indirect majority shareholder.
The Company&rsquo;s Chairman of the Board
 Dr. Vijay Mallya
 is also the Chairman of the board of directors of UBHL.

On
December 9
 2015
 the Company engaged Gordian Group
 LLC (&ldquo;Gordian Group&rdquo;) to serve as the Company&rsquo;s exclusive

 no conclusion as to any specific option or transaction
has been reached
 nor has any specific timetable been fixed for this effort

 2015 and 2014

As
of December 31
 2015
 the fixed charge coverage ratio was required to be 1.15 to 1. The Company calculated that the fixed charge
coverage ratio as of December 31
 2015 was -0.28 to 1. The Company calculated that the required tangible net worth of MBC and
Releta was $6
181
400 as of December 31
 2015 and the actual tangible net worth on such date was $3
738
400. The Company does
not anticipate that it will regain compliance with the required fixed charge coverage ratio or the minimum tangible net worth
in the immediate future.

At
December 31
 2015
 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $129
600
 an accumulated deficit of $17
395
600
 and a working
capital deficit of $11
601
700 due to losses incurred
 reclassification of debts owing to MB Financial as a result of the default
under the Credit and Security Agreement described above and reclassification of subordinated notes payable to UBA maturing in
June 2016. In addition
 the book value of the Company&rsquo;s assets was lower than the book value of its liabilities at December
31
 2015.

Management
has taken several actions to reduce the Company&rsquo;s working capital needs through December 31
 2016
 including reducing discretionary
expenditures
 reducing manpower
 securing additional brewing contracts in an effort to utilize a portion of excess production
capacity
 and pursuing export opportunities. The current revenue from operations are insufficient to meet the working capital
needs of the Company over the next 12 months. The Company has requested UBHL to make a capital infusion. If UBHL is unwilling
or unable to infuse additional capital
 the Company will seek capital from other sources
 including outside investors. If sufficient
capital for working capital needs is not obtained
 the Company may sell some of its operating assets.

If
the Company is unable to find any source of funds
 it may result in a material adverse effect on the Company&rsquo;s ability to
continue operations. If it becomes necessary to seek UBHL&rsquo;s financial assistance under the Letter of Comfort and UBHL does
not provide such financial assistance to MBC
 it may result in a material adverse effect on the Company&rsquo;s financial position
and on its ability to continue operations. In addition
 the Company&rsquo;s lenders may seek to satisfy any outstanding obligations
through recourse against the applicable pledged collateral which may include the Company&rsquo;s real property and fixed and current
assets. The loss of any material pledged asset would have a material adverse effect on the Company&rsquo;s financial position
and results of operations.

UK customers. The initial term of the facility was for a one year period after which time the facility could be terminated by
either party by providing the other party with six months&rsquo; notice. The facility carries an interest rate of 1.38% above
the RBS base rate and a service charge of 0.10% of each invoice discounted. The amount outstanding on this line of credit as of
December 31
 2015 was approximately $1
210

 the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company is also the Chairman
of the Board of Directors of UBHL. The Company has asked Catamaran whether any relationships exist between the shareholders of
Holdings and any affiliates of the Company
 and has not received a response to such inquiries.

The
notes are payable within six months following the date of the notes
 subject to the receipt by the Company of an equity investment
by the Company&rsquo;s majority shareholder in an amount sufficient either (a) to pay the notes through Permitted Payments
 as
defined below
 or (b) to pay the notes and certain existing obligations of the Company to Lender. &ldquo;Permitted Payments&rdquo;

to satisfy its obligations on the notes within the six month period following the date of the notes
 the notes shall be automatically
extended for additional six month terms until they are paid.

680
100 and $3
588
900 as of December 31
 2015 and 2014
 respectively.
Thirteen of the UBA notes are convertible into common stock at $1.50 per share and one UBA note is convertible at a rate of $1.44
per share. The UBA notes have been extended until June 2016 but have automatic renewals after such maturity date for successive
one year terms
 provided that either the Company or UBA may elect not to extend the term upon written notice given to the other
party no more than 60 days and no fewer than 30 days prior to the expiration of such term. UBA may demand payment within 60 days
of the end of the extension period but is precluded from doing so because the notes are subordinated to long-term debt agreements
with MB Financial maturing in June 2016. The Company expects the UBA notes to be continued to be subordinated to any new financing
facility obtained after maturity of MB Financial facility. The Company will also attempt to induce conversion of UBA notes to
equity. Therefore
 the Company will not require the use of working capital to repay any of the UBA notes. The UBA notes included

The
Company is a party to a Separation and Severance Agreement (the &ldquo;Separation Agreement&rdquo;) with Mr. Yashpal Singh
 its
President and Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to the terms of the Separation Agreement
 upon Mr. Singh&rsquo;s (i) termination
of employment for Good Reason (as defined in the Separation Agreement)
 (ii) termination of employment at the end of the employment
term
 (iii) death
 (iv) disability or (v) termination by the Company without Cause (as defined in the Separation Agreement)
 he
shall be entitled to certain severance benefits and payments. The severance payment shall equal the product of 2.5 times his average
monthly base salary (calculated over the twelve (12) month period preceding the termination event)
 multiplied by the number of
years (on a pro-rated basis) he had been employed by the Company at the Termination Date (as defined in the Separation Agreement);
provided
 however
 that the severance payment may not exceed thirty (30) months of Mr. Singh&rsquo;s average monthly base salary
(calculated over the twelve (12) months preceding his termination date). Payments due to Mr. Singh under the Separation Agreement
shall be paid in equal monthly installments by the Company over a 20 month period. Mr. Singh&rsquo;s current employment contract
ends on June 30
 2016.The receipt of payments is contingent on Mr. Singh executing a release of claims for the benefit of the
Company. As of December 31
 2015
 the Company estimated this obligation to be $798
100.

Purchase
of raw materials

Production
of the Company&rsquo;s beverages requires quantities of various processed agricultural products
 including malt and hops for beer.
The Company fulfills its commodities requirements through purchases from various sources

The
Company is periodically involved in legal actions and claims that arise as a result of events that occur in the normal course
of operations. The Company&rsquo;s management and its legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities
 and such assessment inherently
involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company
or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings
 the Company&rsquo;s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of
any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought
therein.

If
the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability
can be estimated
 then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company&rsquo;s financial statements. If the assessment
indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable
 but is reasonably possible
 or is probable but cannot
be estimated
 then the nature of the contingent liability
 together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable
and material
 would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees
in which case the nature of the guarantee would be disclosed.

On

 The New Buffalo Brewing Co.
 Inc. (&ldquo;NBB&rdquo;) initiated an action against Releta in the Supreme Court
of the State of New York for the County of Erie to recover damages for alleged breaches of a Brewing Production Agreement between
NBB and Releta dated September 6
 2013 (the &ldquo;Brewing Production Agreement&rdquo;)
 as well as for a declaration rescinding
and nullifying the Brewing Production Agreement
 and
 in case of Releta&rsquo;s failure to answer or appear
 damages resulting
from the alleged breaches
 rescission of the Brewing Production Agreement
 attorneys&rsquo; fees and any other relief deemed proper
by the court. In a demand letter to Releta dated October 16
 2014
 NBB demanded payment of the sum of $500
000. The Company has
engaged a law firm in New York to respond.

On
June 3
 2015
 IAE International Aero Engines AG (&ldquo;IAE&rdquo;) served the Company with a complaint (the &ldquo;Complaint&rdquo;)
filed in Marin County Superior Court
 California (the &ldquo;Court&rdquo;)
 which requests
 among other things
 (i) that the Court
recognize and enforce a foreign judgment against an Indian corporate entity (which is an affiliate of the Company)
 the alleged
judgment debtor
 and (ii) that such judgment be made enforceable against any assets of the Company (and of the other defendants)
that are located in California
 on the alleged ground that the Company (along with the other defendants) is an &ldquo;alter ego&rdquo;
of the alleged judgment debtor. Along with the Complaint
 IAE also served the Company with an ex parte application for a right
to attach order and a writ of attachment
 and
 in the alternative
 a temporary protective order (collectively
 the &ldquo;ex parte
application&rdquo;) to
 among other things
 stop the Company from making certain transfers to related parties other than in the
ordinary of business.

The
ex parte application came up for hearing before the Court on June 5
 2015. At the conclusion of that hearing
 the Court: (i) issued
a temporary protective order of limited scope
 providing that to the extent the Company had possession
 custody or control of
any stock belonging to the alleged judgment debtor (which the Company does not)
 it should not transfer said stock out of Marin
County
 California until 5:00 PM (Pacific Time)
 June 9
 2015; and (ii) continued the hearing on the ex parte application to 3:00
PM on June 9
 2015. At the conclusion of the continued hearing on June 9
 2015
 the Court denied the ex parte application for
a writ of attachment and dissolved the limited temporary protective order.

The
Company believes that the allegations in the Complaint are without merit and will continue to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.

As
discussed in more detail in the Company&rsquo;s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 9
 2015
 the Company has discussed with
the Lender the allegations set forth in the Complaint and the ex parte application and
 as of the date of this Quarterly Report
the Company has not received any notice or other communication from the Lender that the Lender intends to exercise any of the
remedies available to it under the Credit and Security Agreement in connection therewith.

The
Company is not currently aware of any legal proceedings or claims that the Company believes will have
 individually or in the
aggregate
 a material adverse effect on the Company&rsquo;s financial position or results of operations.

Operating
Leases

The
Company leases some of its operating and office facilities for various terms under long-term
 non-cancelable operating lease agreements.
The leases expire at various dates through 2020 and provide for renewal options ranging from month-to-month to five years. In
the normal course of business
 it is expected that these leases will be renewed or replaced by leases on similar properties. The
leases provide for increases in future minimum annual rental payments based on defined increases which are generally meant to
correlate with the Consumer Price Index
 subject to certain minimum increases. Also
 the agreements generally require the Company
to pay certain costs (real estate taxes
 insurance and repairs).

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
equivalents
 and accounts receivable. Substantially all of the Company&rsquo;s cash and cash equivalents are deposited with commercial
banks that have minimal credit risk
 in the US and the UK. Accounts receivable are generally unsecured and customers are subject
to an initial credit review and ongoing monitoring. Wholesale distributors account for substantially all accounts receivable;
therefore
 this risk concentration is limited due to the number of distributors and the laws regulating the financial affairs
of distributors of alcoholic beverages. The Company has approximately $68
300 in cash deposits and $2
714
200 of accounts receivable
due from customers located in the UK as of December 31
 2015.

The
Company&rsquo;s business presently consists of two segments &ndash; the North American Territory and the Foreign Territory.

The
Company&rsquo;s operations in the North American Territory consist primarily of brewing and marketing proprietary craft beers.
For distribution in the North American Territory
 the Company brews its brands in its own facilities
 which are located in Ukiah
California and Saratoga Springs
 New York. This segment accounted for approximately 38% and 37% of the Company&rsquo;s gross sales
during the years 2015 and 2014
 respectively.

The
Company&rsquo;s operations in the Foreign Territory
 which are conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary UBIUK and UBIUK&rsquo;s
wholly-owned subsidiary KBEL
 consist primarily of the marketing and distribution of Kingfisher Premium Lager in the Foreign Territory
through Indian restaurants
 chain retail grocers
 liquor stores
 and other retail outlets (such as convenience stores). This segment
accounted for approximately 62% and 63% of the Company&rsquo;s gross sales during 2015 and 2014 respectively.

AND SEVERANCE AGREEMENT

This
Separation and Severance Agreement (the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) is effective April 12
 2016 by and between Mendocino Brewing
Company
 Inc. a California corporation (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) and Mahadevan Narayanan (the &ldquo;Executive&rdquo;).



A.
The Company and Executive wish enter in to a severance agreement relating to the termination of Executive&rsquo;s employment with
the Company.

B.
NOW
 THEREFORE
 in consideration of the mutual agreements
 covenants and other promises set forth herein
 and for other good and
valuable consideration
 the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and accepted
 the parties agree as follows.

1.


A.
Executive may terminate his employment for Good Reason (as defined below) by providing the Chief Executive Officer of the Company
(the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;)
 below
 with
a written notice that specifies such event and any relevant facts and circumstances that allegedly justifies termination of employment
by Executive. The Company shall have an opportunity to cure the event specified in such notice within thirty (30) days following
delivery of such notice. If the Company fails to cure those circumstances in all material respects by the expiration of the thirty
(30) day notice period
 the Executive&rsquo;s employment with the Company shall cease. The Executive&rsquo;s Termination Date
shall be the earlier of the day that the Executive ceases to provide services to the Company or the day that the facts and circumstances
indicated that the Executive has permanently reduced the level of services he provides to the Company to twenty percent (20%)
or less than the average level of bona fide services performed for the Company over the immediately preceding thirty-six (36)
month period (unless otherwise specified in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended
 (the &ldquo;Code&rdquo;)
 level of
services will be based on hours worked). Notwithstanding the foregoing
 during the time period that Executive is on any bona fide
leave of absence
 the employment relationship is deemed to be continuing intact. In case of termination by Executive for Good
Reason as set forth in this 
 Executive shall be entitled to the severance payment and benefits set forth in
 herein contingent upon return of all Company property in Executive&rsquo;s possession and execution of a release
 (the &ldquo;Release&rdquo;) within ninety (90) days of the Executive&rsquo;s Termination
Date.

B.
For purposes of this Agreement
 the term &ldquo;Good Reason&rdquo; shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events without
the written consent of Executive: (i) a material reduction in Executive&rsquo;s base salary; (ii) relocation of Executive by the
Company outside the fifty (50) mile radius surrounding Executive&rsquo;s then present location; and (iii) a material diminution
in Executive&rsquo;s duties
 authority or responsibilities.


    
    


2.


A.
Executive may voluntarily terminate his employment with the Company without Good Reason at any time with one (1) year prior notice.
If Executive provides such notice
 the Company
 at the sole discretion of the Board
 may accelerate the termination of Executive&rsquo;s
employment to any date after receipt of such notice from Executive and prior to the date of termination specified in the notice
from Executive. Any acceleration of the termination of Executive&rsquo;s employment shall be effective on written notice being
delivered to Executive by the Company. On any such acceleration by the Company
 Executive shall not be entitled to any payment
in lieu of notice. If Executive&rsquo;s employment is terminated pursuant to this 
 Executive shall receive
payment for all accrued salary
 vacation time
 and benefits owed Executive through the Termination Date. For purposes of this

 the Termination Date shall be the earlier of the day that the Executive ceases to provide services to the
Company or the day that the facts and circumstances indicated that the Executive has permanently reduced the level of services

 level of services will be
based on hours worked).

In case of a resignation without Good Reason by Executive
 the Company shall have no further obligation to pay compensation of
any kind (except for accrued salary
 vacation time and benefits as set forth above) or severance payment of any kind or to make
any payment in lieu of notice. All benefits provided by the Company to Executive shall cease on the Termination Date. For the
avoidance of doubt

and benefits as set forth in

 exceed 30 months of Executive&rsquo;s
average monthly base salary over the preceding twelve (12) month period. For purposes of calculating the number of years of Executive&rsquo;s
service in this 
 a partial year of service shall be counted but shall be pro rated based on the actual number
of months worked during such partial year of service. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 no payment under this 
shall be paid unless all Company property in Executive&rsquo;s possession at his death is returned and the Release is executed
by an authorized signatory for the Executive&rsquo;s estate within ninety (90) days of the Executive&rsquo;s date of death. All
payments shall be made less standard withholdings for taxes and social security

of months worked during such partial year of service. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 no payment under this 
shall be paid unless all Company property in Executive&rsquo;s possession is returned and the Release is executed by the Executive

 in its sole discretion
 determines that Executive
is Disabled. All payments shall be made less standard withholdings for taxes and social security

 the Company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit&#13;to a valuation allowance. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written&#13;off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable.

The Company reviews the carrying value of property and equipment and any&#13;other long-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset&#13;may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases&#13;where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value

 deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between&#13;the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

 the federal excise tax is $7 per barrel on the first 60
000 barrels of beer removed for consumption or sale during a calendar&#13;year
 and $18 per barrel for each barrel in excess of 60
000. Individual states also impose excise taxes on alcoholic beverages&#13;in varying amounts
 which have also been subject to change. Sales as presented in the Company&amp;#146;s statements of operations&#13;reflect the amount invoiced to the Company&amp;#146;s wholesalers and other customers.

 Plant and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of&#13;an Entity
&amp;#148; which changes the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as discontinued operations and modifies&#13;related disclosure requirements. This ASU was effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15
 2014
 and interim periods&#13;within those years. Early adoption was permitted

 the&#13;company adopted FASB&amp;#146;s guidance on reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity.&#13;This standard raises the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires new disclosures of both discontinued&#13;operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. The guidance is effective for&#13;annual reporting periods ending after December 15
 2014. Early adoption was permitted but only for disposals that have not been&#13;reported in financial statements previously issued. The adoption of this guidance has not had a material impact on its financial&#13;position

 the Financial Accounting&#13;Standards Board (&amp;#147;FASB&amp;#148;) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01
 which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on&#13;the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for&#13;equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
 and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial&#13;instruments. In addition
 the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax&#13;assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and&#13;interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 and upon adoption

 the FASB issued (ASU)&#13;2015-17
 Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. Currently deferred taxes for each tax jurisdiction are presented as a&#13;net current asset or liability and net noncurrent asset or liability on the balance sheet. To simplify the presentation
 the new&#13;guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets for all jurisdictions along with any related valuation allowances be&#13;classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting&#13;periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 and early adoption is permitted. The Company has adopted this guidance in the fourth&#13;quarter of the year ended December 31
 2015 on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact&#13;on the Company&amp;#146;s financial position
 results of operations or cash flows

 the FASB issued ASU&#13;2015-16
 Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement &amp;#150;Period Adjustments. Changes to the accounting for measurement-period&#13;adjustments relate to business combinations. Currently
 an acquiring entity is required to retrospectively adjust the balance sheet&#13;amounts of the acquiree recognized at the acquisition date with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill as a result of changes made&#13;to the balance sheet amounts of the acquiree. The measurement period is the period after the acquisition date during which the&#13;acquirer may adjust the balance sheet amounts recognized for a business combination (generally up to one year from the date of&#13;acquisition). The changes eliminate the requirement to make such retrospective adjustments
 and
 instead require the acquiring&#13;entity to record these adjustments in the reporting period they are determined. The new standard is effective for both public and&#13;private companies for periods beginning after December 15

 the FASB issued ASU 2015-11
&#13;&amp;#147;Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory
&amp;#148; which applies to inventory that is measured using&#13;first-in
 first-out (&amp;#147;FIFO&amp;#148;) or average cost. Under the updated guidance
 an entity should measure inventory that is&#13;within scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value
 which is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business
&#13;less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory&#13;that is measured using last-in
 first-out (&amp;#147;LIFO&amp;#148;). This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning&#13;after December 15
 2016

&#13;&amp;#147;Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share&#13;(or Its Equivalent)
&amp;#148; which removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which&#13;fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Further
 the amendments remove the requirement&#13;to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share&#13;practical expedient. This ASU is effective for annual periods
 including interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning&#13;after December 15

&amp;#148; which provides guidance about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.&#13;If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license
 the customer should account for the software license element of the&#13;arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software&#13;license
 the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. This ASU is effective for annual periods
 including&#13;interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December 15
 2015

 the FASB issued guidance&#13;related to a customer&amp;#146;s accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. This standard provides guidance to customers&#13;about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license
&#13;then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software&#13;licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license
 the customer should account for the arrangement&#13;as a service contract. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2015
 and&#13;early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt this guidance on January 1
 2016. The adoption of this guidance is not expected&#13;to have a material impact on its financial position

 the FASB issued ASU&#13;2015-02
 &amp;#147;Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis
&amp;#148; which makes changes to both the variable&#13;interest model and voting interest model and eliminates the indefinite deferral of FASB Statement No. 167
 included in ASU 2010-10
&#13;for certain investment funds. All reporting entities that hold a variable interest in other legal entities will need to re-evaluate&#13;their consolidation conclusions as well as disclosure requirements. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December&#13;15

 &amp;#147;Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815).&amp;#148; Entities commonly raise capital by issuing different classes of shares
&#13;including preferred stock
 that entitle the holders to certain preferences and rights over the other shareholders. The specific&#13;terms of those shares may include conversion rights
 redemption rights
 voting rights
 and liquidation and dividend payment preferences
&#13;among other features. One or more of those features may meet the definition of a derivative under GAAP. Shares that include such&#13;embedded derivative features are referred to as hybrid financial instruments. The objective of this update is to eliminate the&#13;use of different methods in practice and thereby reduce existing diversity under GAAP in the accounting for hybrid financial instruments&#13;issued in the form of a share. The amendments are effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning&#13;after December 15

 the FASB issued ASU&#13;2014-15
 &amp;#147;Presentation of Financial Statements &amp;#150; Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)
 effective for the annual period ending&#13;after December 15

 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. This standard provides&#13;guidance about management&amp;#146;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&amp;#146;s ability&#13;to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods&#13;ending after December 15
 2016
 and early adoption is permitted. The Company expects to adopt this guidance on January 1
 2017.&#13;The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact
 if any
 the adoption of ASU 2014-15 will have on footnote disclosures
&#13;however
 the Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have any impact on its financial position

 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09
&#13;&amp;#147;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
&amp;#148; on revenue recognition. This guidance provides that an entity&#13;should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration&#13;to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance also requires more detailed&#13;disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash&#13;flows arising from contracts with customers. The original effective date of this guidance was for interim and annual reporting&#13;periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 early adoption is not permitted
 and the guidance must be applied retrospectively or&#13;modified retrospectively. In July 2015
 the FASB approved an optional one-year deferral of the effective date. As a result
 we&#13;expect to adopt this guidance on January 1
 2018. The Company has not yet determined its approach to adoption or the impact the&#13;adoption of this guidance will have on its financial position

 which is used in the determination of the amount available to each of MBC and Releta pursuant to the revolving&#13;facility. Under the terms of the Credit and Security Agreement
 if such availability is less than $0
 or if certain components&#13;of the borrowing base of each of MBC and Releta fall below certain limits in relation to outstanding revolving loans

 2015
 MBC
 Releta
 and&#13;Lender entered into a Second Amendment (the &amp;#147;Second Amendment&amp;#148;) to the Credit and Security Agreement. The Second Amendment&#13;reduced the maximum amount of the Revolver from $4
119
000 to $2
500
000. The Second Amendment also changed the definition of borrowing&#13;base (including by lowering certain advance rates) such that the calculation of the borrowing base will result in a lower number&#13;than it would have if calculated prior to the effectiveness of the Second Amendment. The borrowing base is used in the determination&#13;of the amount available to each borrower (a &amp;#147;Borrower&amp;#148;) pursuant to the Revolver. Pursuant to the Credit and Security&#13;Agreement
 if such availability is less than $0
 or if certain components of the borrowing base fall below certain limits in relation&#13;to outstanding revolving loans

 which is used in the determination of the amount available to each&#13;Borrower pursuant to the Revolver. As stated above
 if such availability is less than $0
 or if certain components of the borrowing&#13;base fall below certain limits in relation to outstanding revolving loans

 the Second Default Notice or the Third Default Notice and has reserved the right to all&#13;other available rights and remedies under the Credit and Security Agreement
 certain other related documents and applicable law.&#13;Lender could declare the full amount owed under the Credit and Security Agreement due and payable at any time for any reason or&#13;no reason. Since receiving the Second Amendment
 the Company has not received any notice or other communication from Lender that&#13;it intends to exercise any other remedies available to it under the Credit and Security Agreement in connection with the events&#13;of default. Lender continues to charge a default interest rate equal to two percent (2%) per annum in excess of the interest rate&#13;otherwise payable under the Credit and Security Agreement. The exercise of additional remedies by Lender may have a material adverse&#13;effect on the Company&amp;#146;s financial condition and the Company&amp;#146;s ability to continue to operate. If it becomes necessary&#13;for MBC and Releta to seek additional financing

 2015 (the &amp;#147;Letter of Comfort&amp;#148;)
 to confirm that UBHL had agreed to provide funding on an as needed basis&#13;to ensure that the Company is able to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. The Letter of Comfort does not&#13;specify either the terms of UBHL&amp;#146;s support
 or a maximum dollar limit and is not a legally binding agreement. However
 to&#13;date UBHL through its affiliated company
 Catamaran
 has provided funds for working capital needs. UBHL&amp;#146;s financial support&#13;is contingent upon compliance with any applicable exchange control requirements
 other applicable laws
 and regulations relating&#13;to the transfer of funds from India. The Letter of Comfort does not specify any time limit for extending support. If it becomes&#13;necessary to seek UBHL&amp;#146;s financial assistance under the Letter of Comfort and UBHL is either unable or unwilling to provide&#13;such financial assistance to MBC
 it may result in a material adverse effect on the Company&amp;#146;s financial position and on its&#13;ability to continue operations. UBHL controls the Company&amp;#146;s two largest shareholders

&#13;the Company will seek capital from other sources
 including outside investors. If sufficient capital for working capital needs&#13;is not obtained

 it may result in a material adverse effect on the Company&amp;#146;s ability to continue operations. If it becomes&#13;necessary to seek UBHL&amp;#146;s financial assistance under the Letter of Comfort and UBHL does not provide such financial assistance&#13;to MBC
 it may result in a material adverse effect on the Company&amp;#146;s financial position and on its ability to continue operations.&#13;In addition

 respectively. Thirteen of the UBA notes&#13;are convertible into common stock at $1.50 per share and one UBA note is convertible at a rate of $1.44 per share. The UBA notes&#13;have been extended until June 2016 but have automatic renewals after such maturity date for successive one year terms
 provided&#13;that either the Company or UBA may elect not to extend the term upon written notice given to the other party no more than 60 days&#13;and no fewer than 30 days prior to the expiration of such term. UBA may demand payment within 60 days of the end of the extension&#13;period but is precluded from doing so because the notes are subordinated to long-term debt agreements with MB Financial maturing&#13;in June 2016. The Company expects the UBA notes to be continued to be subordinated to any new financing facility obtained after&#13;maturity of MB Financial facility. The Company will also attempt to induce conversion of UBA notes to equity. Therefore
 the Company&#13;will not require the use of working capital to repay any of the UBA notes. The UBA notes included $1

 and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment.&#13;In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may&#13;result in such proceedings

 then the estimated&#13;liability would be accrued in the Company&amp;#146;s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material&#13;loss contingency is not probable
 but is reasonably possible
 or is probable but cannot be estimated
 then the nature of the contingent&#13;liability
 together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material
 would be disclosed. Loss contingencies&#13;considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees

&#13;it is expected that these leases will be renewed or replaced by leases on similar properties. The leases provide for increases&#13;in future minimum annual rental payments based on defined increases which are generally meant to correlate with the Consumer Price&#13;Index
 subject to certain minimum increases. Also
 the agreements generally require the Company to pay certain costs (real estate&#13;taxes

 and some leases are adjusted annually for changes in the consumer price&#13;index. Rent expense charged to operations was $310

 the&#13;Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (&amp;#147;ASU&amp;#148;) 2014-08
 &amp;#147;Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205)&#13;and Property
 Plant and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of&#13;an Entity
&amp;#148; which changes the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as discontinued operations and modifies&#13;related disclosure requirements. This ASU was effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15
 2014
 and interim periods&#13;within those years. Early adoption was permitted

 the&#13;company adopted FASB&amp;#146;s guidance on reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity.&#13;This standard raises the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires new disclosures of both discontinued&#13;operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. The guidance is effective for&#13;annual reporting periods ending after December 15
 2014. Early adoption was permitted but only for disposals that have not been&#13;reported in financial statements previously issued. The adoption of this guidance has not had a material impact on its financial&#13;position

 the Financial Accounting&#13;Standards Board (&amp;#147;FASB&amp;#148;) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01
 which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on&#13;the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for&#13;equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
 and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial&#13;instruments. In addition
 the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax&#13;assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and&#13;interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 and upon adoption

 the FASB issued (ASU)&#13;2015-17
 Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. Currently deferred taxes for each tax jurisdiction are presented as a&#13;net current asset or liability and net noncurrent asset or liability on the balance sheet. To simplify the presentation
 the new&#13;guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets for all jurisdictions along with any related valuation allowances be&#13;classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting&#13;periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 and early adoption is permitted. The Company has adopted this guidance in the fourth&#13;quarter of the year ended December 31
 2015 on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact&#13;on the Company&amp;#146;s financial position
 results of operations or cash flows

 the FASB issued ASU&#13;2015-16
 Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement &amp;#150;Period Adjustments. Changes to the accounting for measurement-period&#13;adjustments relate to business combinations. Currently
 an acquiring entity is required to retrospectively adjust the balance sheet&#13;amounts of the acquiree recognized at the acquisition date with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill as a result of changes made&#13;to the balance sheet amounts of the acquiree. The measurement period is the period after the acquisition date during which the&#13;acquirer may adjust the balance sheet amounts recognized for a business combination (generally up to one year from the date of&#13;acquisition). The changes eliminate the requirement to make such retrospective adjustments
 and
 instead require the acquiring&#13;entity to record these adjustments in the reporting period they are determined. The new standard is effective for both public and&#13;private companies for periods beginning after December 15

 the FASB issued ASU 2015-11
&#13;&amp;#147;Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory
&amp;#148; which applies to inventory that is measured using&#13;first-in
 first-out (&amp;#147;FIFO&amp;#148;) or average cost. Under the updated guidance
 an entity should measure inventory that is&#13;within scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value
 which is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business
&#13;less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory&#13;that is measured using last-in
 first-out (&amp;#147;LIFO&amp;#148;). This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning&#13;after December 15
 2016

 the FASB issued ASU 2015-07
&#13;&amp;#147;Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share&#13;(or Its Equivalent)
&amp;#148; which removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which&#13;fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Further
 the amendments remove the requirement&#13;to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share&#13;practical expedient. This ASU is effective for annual periods
 including interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning&#13;after December 15
 2015

 the FASB issued ASU 2015-05
&#13;&amp;#147;Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer&amp;#146;s Accounting for Fees Paid in&#13;a Cloud Computing Arrangement
&amp;#148; which provides guidance about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.&#13;If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license
 the customer should account for the software license element of the&#13;arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software&#13;license
 the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. This ASU is effective for annual periods
 including&#13;interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December 15
 2015

 the FASB issued guidance&#13;related to a customer&amp;#146;s accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. This standard provides guidance to customers&#13;about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license
&#13;then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software&#13;licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license
 the customer should account for the arrangement&#13;as a service contract. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2015
 and&#13;early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt this guidance on January 1
 2016. The adoption of this guidance is not expected&#13;to have a material impact on its financial position

 the FASB issued ASU&#13;2015-02
 &amp;#147;Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis
&amp;#148; which makes changes to both the variable&#13;interest model and voting interest model and eliminates the indefinite deferral of FASB Statement No. 167
 included in ASU 2010-10
&#13;for certain investment funds. All reporting entities that hold a variable interest in other legal entities will need to re-evaluate&#13;their consolidation conclusions as well as disclosure requirements. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December&#13;15
 2015
 and early adoption is permitted

 the FASB issued ASU&#13;2015-01
 &amp;#147;Income Statement &amp;#150; Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20)
&amp;#148; effective for fiscal years
&#13;and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December 15

 the FASB issued ASU&#13;2014-16
 &amp;#147;Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815).&amp;#148; Entities commonly raise capital by issuing different classes of shares
&#13;including preferred stock
 that entitle the holders to certain preferences and rights over the other shareholders. The specific&#13;terms of those shares may include conversion rights
 redemption rights
 voting rights
 and liquidation and dividend payment preferences
&#13;among other features. One or more of those features may meet the definition of a derivative under GAAP. Shares that include such&#13;embedded derivative features are referred to as hybrid financial instruments. The objective of this update is to eliminate the&#13;use of different methods in practice and thereby reduce existing diversity under GAAP in the accounting for hybrid financial instruments&#13;issued in the form of a share. The amendments are effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning&#13;after December 15

 the FASB issued ASU&#13;2014-15
 &amp;#147;Presentation of Financial Statements &amp;#150; Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)
 effective for the annual period ending&#13;after December 15
 2016
 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. This standard provides&#13;guidance about management&amp;#146;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&amp;#146;s ability&#13;to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods&#13;ending after December 15
 2016
 and early adoption is permitted. The Company expects to adopt this guidance on January 1
 2017.&#13;The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact
 if any
 the adoption of ASU 2014-15 will have on footnote disclosures
&#13;however
 the Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have any impact on its financial position

 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09
&#13;&amp;#147;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
&amp;#148; on revenue recognition. This guidance provides that an entity&#13;should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration&#13;to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance also requires more detailed&#13;disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash&#13;flows arising from contracts with customers. The original effective date of this guidance was for interim and annual reporting&#13;periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 early adoption is not permitted
 and the guidance must be applied retrospectively or&#13;modified retrospectively. In July 2015
 the FASB approved an optional one-year deferral of the effective date. As a result
 we&#13;expect to adopt this guidance on January 1
 2018. The Company has not yet determined its approach to adoption or the impact the&#13;adoption of this guidance will have on its financial position
 results of operations or cash flows
 if any. Other recent accounting&#13;pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force (&amp;#147;EITF&amp;#148;))

formed in 1983 in California
 and has two operating subsidiaries: Releta Brewing Company
 LLC
 (&#147;Releta&#148;)
 and United
Breweries International (UK) Limited (&#147;UBIUK&#148;). In the United States (&#147;US&#148;)
 MBC and its subsidiary
 Releta
operate two breweries that produce beer for the specialty &#147;craft&#148; segment of the beer market. The breweries are located
in Ukiah
 California and Saratoga Springs
 New York. The majority of sales for Mendocino Brewing Company in the US are in California.
The Company brews several brands
 of which Red Tail Ale is the flagship brand. In addition
 the Company performs contract brewing
for several other brands
 and MBC holds the license to distribute Kingfisher Premium Lager Beer in the US and Canada. Generally
product shipments are made directly from the breweries to the wholesalers or distributors in accordance with state and local laws.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
 Short-

 the Company
considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.




assets are located in the UK. Although this country is considered economically stable and the Company has experienced no notable
burden from foreign exchange transactions
 export duties
 or government regulations
 it is always possible that unanticipated events
in foreign countries could disrupt the Company&#146;s operations.

Trade Accounts Receivable and Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts


at the invoiced amount and are the amount the Company expects to collect. Sales are made to approved customers on an open account
basis
 subject to established credit limits
 and generally no collateral is required. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the
Company&#146;s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Company&#146;s existing accounts receivable; however
changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future.




doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Management considers
the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts: customer credit-worthiness
 past transaction
history with the customer
 current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms. Past due balances over 90
days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectability. If the financial condition of the Company&#146;s
customers were to deteriorate
 adversely affecting their ability to make payments
 additional allowances would be required. Based
on management&#146;s assessment
 the Company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit
to a valuation allowance. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written
off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. The Company had allowances of $69
100 and
$56
700 for doubtful accounts receivable as of December 31
 2015 and 2014
 respectively.




of average cost
 which approximates the first-in
 first-out method
 or market (net realizable value). The Company regularly reviews
its inventories for the presence of obsolete product attributed to age
 seasonality and quality. Inventories that are considered
obsolete are written off or adjusted to carrying value.

Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets



consist of deposits
 other receivables
 and prepayments for future services. Prepayments are expensed when the services are received.




cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over the assets&#146; estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements
are amortized over the shorter of the life of the improvement or the life of the related lease. The Company uses other depreciation
methods (generally
 accelerated depreciation methods) for tax purposes where appropriate. Costs of maintenance and repairs are
charged to expense as incurred; significant renewals and betterments are capitalized. When property and equipment are retired
sold
 or otherwise disposed of
 the asset&#146;s carrying amount and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
and any gain or loss is included in the statement of operations.

of the lease. Amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of
the assets or the period of the related lease.




of its long-lived assets periodically in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360
 (Accounting
for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets). The Company reviews the carrying value of property and equipment and any
other long-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset
may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases
where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value
 an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount
by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment
include current operating results
 trends
 and prospects
 as well as the effects of obsolescence
 demand
 competition
 and other
economic factors. Long-lived assets that management commits to sell or abandon are reported at the lower of carrying amount or
fair value less cost to sell.




are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related debt. When a loan is paid in full
 any unamortized financing costs are
removed from the related accounts and charged to operations. Deferred financing costs related to borrowing made in June 2011 were
$225
000. Amortization of deferred financing costs charged to operations was $45
000 for the years ended December 31
 2015 and
2014.




in accordance with ASC 750 which requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes
and allows recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future
years. Under the asset and liability approach
 deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences
and operating loss
 and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established to reduce the deferred tax asset if it is
more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.


tax positions that the Company has taken or expects to take on a tax return (including a decision whether to file or not to file
a return in a particular jurisdiction). The Company evaluated its tax positions and determined that there were no uncertain tax
benefits for the years ending December 31
 2015 and 2014.




brewing and distribution operations in accordance with ASC 605. The Company recognizes revenue from product sales
 net of discounts.

are recognized when sales have been completed.




taxes on the sale of alcoholic beverages
 including beer. For brewers producing less than 2.0 million barrels of beer per calendar
year
 the federal excise tax is $7 per barrel on the first 60
000 barrels of beer removed for consumption or sale during a calendar
year
 and $18 per barrel for each barrel in excess of 60
000. Individual states also impose excise taxes on alcoholic beverages
in varying amounts
 which have also been subject to change. Sales as presented in the Company&#146;s statements of operations
reflect the amount invoiced to the Company&#146;s wholesalers and other customers. Excise taxes due to federal and state agencies
are not collected from the Company&#146;s customers
 but rather are the responsibility of the Company. Net sales
 as presented
in the Company&#146;s statements of operations
 are reduced by applicable federal and state excise taxes. In the UK
 excise taxes
are paid by the manufacturer and not by the Company.




products and in response to local competitive conditions
 the Company regularly offers price discounts to distributors and retailers
in most of its markets. Sales for the years 2015 and 2014
 as presented in the Company&#146;s statements of operations
 are reduced
by $1
204
400 and $1
140
800 respectively
 related to such discounts.




chargebacks for promotional expenses by distributors. The Company estimates its reserves by utilizing historical information and
current contracts. In estimating chargeback reserves
 the Company analyzes actual chargeback amounts and applies historical chargeback
rates to estimate potential chargeback. The Company routinely assesses its experience with distributors and adjusts the reserves
accordingly. If actual chargebacks and other rebates are greater than the Company&#146;s estimates
 additional reserves may be
required. Revisions to estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.




are somewhat seasonal
 with the first and fourth quarters historically being the slowest and the rest of the year generating stronger
sales. The volume of sales may also be affected by weather conditions. Because of the seasonality of the Company&#146;s business
results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.




to tax authorities are sales tax collected from our retail customers. State and federal excise taxes on beer shipments are the
responsibility of the Company and included in our selling price. Excise taxes on shipments are shown in a separate line item in
the consolidated statement of operations as reduction of gross sales. Sales taxes collected from customers are recognized as a
liability
 with the liability subsequently reduced when the taxes are remitted to the tax authority. Total sales taxes collected
from customers and remitted to tax authorities were not material in 2015 and 2014.




 (Shipping
and Handling Fees and Costs) the company reports pass-through freight costs on beer shipped to independent beer wholesalers in
cost of sales. Reimbursements of these costs by wholesalers are reported in sales.


Company to deliver beer to wholesalers are included in marketing
 distribution and administrative expenses. These costs are considered
marketing related because in addition to product delivery
 wholesalers provide marketing and other customer service functions to
customers including product display
 shelf space management
 distribution of promotional materials
 and product rotation. Shipping
costs included in marketing expense totaled $968

manufacturing or distribution facilities. In the event any materials and/or services are provided to one operating segment by the
other
 the transaction is valued according to the Company&#146;s transfer policy

 the
Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) 2014-08
 &#147;Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205)
and Property
 Plant and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of
an Entity
&#148; which changes the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as discontinued operations and modifies
related disclosure requirements. This ASU was effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15
 2014
 and interim periods
within those years. Early adoption was permitted
 but only for disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that had not been
reported in the financial statements previously issued or available for issuance. See Notes X for disclosures related to this adoption.


 the
company adopted FASB&#146;s guidance on reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity.
This standard raises the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires new disclosures of both discontinued
operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. The guidance is effective for
annual reporting periods ending after December 15
 2014. Early adoption was permitted but only for disposals that have not been
reported in financial statements previously issued. The adoption of this guidance has not had a material impact on its financial
position
 results of operations or cash flows.


 the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01
 which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on
the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for
equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
 and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial
instruments. In addition
 the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax
assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and
interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 and upon adoption
 an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect
adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption
is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting
from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
this guidance.


 the FASB issued (ASU)
2015-17
 Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. Currently deferred taxes for each tax jurisdiction are presented as a
net current asset or liability and net noncurrent asset or liability on the balance sheet. To simplify the presentation
 the new
guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets for all jurisdictions along with any related valuation allowances be
classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 and early adoption is permitted. The Company has adopted this guidance in the fourth
quarter of the year ended December 31
 2015 on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact
on the Company&#146;s financial position
 results of operations or cash flows
 and did not have any effect on prior periods due
to the full valuation allowance against the Company&#146;s net deferred tax assets.


 the FASB issued ASU
2015-16
 Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement &#150;Period Adjustments. Changes to the accounting for measurement-period
adjustments relate to business combinations. Currently
 an acquiring entity is required to retrospectively adjust the balance sheet
amounts of the acquiree recognized at the acquisition date with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill as a result of changes made
to the balance sheet amounts of the acquiree. The measurement period is the period after the acquisition date during which the
acquirer may adjust the balance sheet amounts recognized for a business combination (generally up to one year from the date of
acquisition). The changes eliminate the requirement to make such retrospective adjustments
 and
 instead require the acquiring
entity to record these adjustments in the reporting period they are determined. The new standard is effective for both public and
private companies for periods beginning after December 15
 2015. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this
guidance.


 the FASB issued ASU 2015-11
&#147;Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory
&#148; which applies to inventory that is measured using
first-in
 first-out (&#147;FIFO&#148;) or average cost. Under the updated guidance
 an entity should measure inventory that is
within scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value
 which is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business
less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory
that is measured using last-in
 first-out (&#147;LIFO&#148;). This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning
after December 15
 2016
 and should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted at the beginning of an interim or annual
reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.


 the FASB issued ASU 2015-07
&#147;Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share
(or Its Equivalent)
&#148; which removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which
fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Further
 the amendments remove the requirement
to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share
practical expedient. This ASU is effective for annual periods
 including interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning
after December 15
 2015
 and early adoption is permitted. The new guidance should be applied on a retrospective basis to all periods
presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.


 the FASB issued ASU 2015-05
&#147;Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer&#146;s Accounting for Fees Paid in
a Cloud Computing Arrangement
&#148; which provides guidance about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.
If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license
 the customer should account for the software license element of the
arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software
license
 the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. This ASU is effective for annual periods
 including
interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December 15
 2015
 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.


 the FASB issued guidance
related to a customer&#146;s accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. This standard provides guidance to customers
about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license
then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software
licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license
 the customer should account for the arrangement
as a service contract. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2015
 and
early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt this guidance on January 1
 2016. The adoption of this guidance is not expected
to have a material impact on its financial position
 results of operations or cash flows.


 the FASB issued ASU
2015-02
 &#147;Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis
&#148; which makes changes to both the variable
interest model and voting interest model and eliminates the indefinite deferral of FASB Statement No. 167
 included in ASU 2010-10
for certain investment funds. All reporting entities that hold a variable interest in other legal entities will need to re-evaluate
their consolidation conclusions as well as disclosure requirements. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December
15
 2015
 and early adoption is permitted
 including any interim period. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance
to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.

 &#147;Income Statement &#150; Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20)
&#148; effective for fiscal years
and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December 15
 2015. This update eliminates from GAAP the concept
of extraordinary items. The adoption of ASU 2014-16 will not have a significant impact on the Company&#146;s financial position
or results of operations.


 the FASB issued ASU
2014-16
 &#147;Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815).&#148; Entities commonly raise capital by issuing different classes of shares
including preferred stock
 that entitle the holders to certain preferences and rights over the other shareholders. The specific
terms of those shares may include conversion rights
 redemption rights
 voting rights
 and liquidation and dividend payment preferences
among other features. One or more of those features may meet the definition of a derivative under GAAP. Shares that include such
embedded derivative features are referred to as hybrid financial instruments. The objective of this update is to eliminate the
use of different methods in practice and thereby reduce existing diversity under GAAP in the accounting for hybrid financial instruments
issued in the form of a share. The amendments are effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning
after December 15
 2015. The adoption of ASU 2014-16 will not have a significant impact on the Company&#146;s financial position
or results of operations.

 &#147;Presentation of Financial Statements &#150; Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)
 effective for the annual period ending
after December 15
 2016
 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. This standard provides
guidance about management&#146;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&#146;s ability
to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods
ending after December 15
 2016
 and early adoption is permitted. The Company expects to adopt this guidance on January 1
 2017.
The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact
 if any
 the adoption of ASU 2014-15 will have on footnote disclosures

 the Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have any impact on its financial position
 results of operations

&#147;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
&#148; on revenue recognition. This guidance provides that an entity
should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance also requires more detailed
disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash
flows arising from contracts with customers. The original effective date of this guidance was for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 early adoption is not permitted
 and the guidance must be applied retrospectively or
modified retrospectively. In July 2015
 the FASB approved an optional one-year deferral of the effective date. As a result
 we
expect to adopt this guidance on January 1
 2018. The Company has not yet determined its approach to adoption or the impact the
adoption of this guidance will have on its financial position
 results of operations or cash flows
 if any. Other recent accounting
pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force (&#147;EITF&#148;))

Public Accountants (&#147;AICPA&#148;)
 and the SEC did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the
Company&#146;s present or future financial statements.

 2011
 MBC and Releta entered
into a Credit and Security Agreement (as amended
 the &#147;Credit and Security Agreement&#148;) with Cole Taylor Bank
 an Illinois
banking corporation (&#147;Cole Taylor&#148;). Cole Taylor merged into MB Financial Bank
 an Illinois banking corporation (&#147;MB
Financial&#148;) on August 18
 2014. As used in this Report
 &#147;Lender&#148; shall refer to Cole Taylor prior to August 18
2014 and to MB Financial
 as successor in interest to Cole Taylor
 on or after August 18
 2014. The Credit and Security Agreement
provided a credit facility with a maturity date of June 23
 2016 of up to $10
000
000 consisting of a $4
119
000 revolving facility
(the &#147;Revolver&#148;)

MBC and Releta to maintain certain minimum fixed charge coverage ratios for trailing twelve month periods and minimum tangible
net worth. The minimum tangible net worth MBC and Releta are required to maintain is subject to increase based on the net income
of MBC and Releta. On March 29
 2013
 MBC
 Releta
 and Lender entered into a First Amendment to the Credit and Security Agreement
to clarify the method by which the fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated
 with retrospective application.


for the trailing twelve month periods ended March 31
 2013 onwards fell short of the required ratio. The tangible net worth fell
short of the required amount for the period beginning June 1
 2013 onwards.


 2013
 MBC and Releta
received a notice (the &#147;Default Notice&#148;) from Lender regarding its intention to exercise certain rights with respect
to events of default of the Company pursuant to the Credit and Security Agreement.


that the failure of MBC and Releta to observe any covenant will constitute an event of default under the Credit and Security Agreement.
Under the Credit and Security Agreement
 upon the occurrence of an event of default
 all of MBC&#146;s and Releta&#146;s obligations
under the Credit and Security Agreement may
 at the option of the Lender
 be declared
 and immediately shall become
 due and payable
without notice of any kind. The event of default shall be deemed continuing until waived in writing by the Lender. The Default
Notice states that Lender has elected
 effective September 1
 2013
 to charge a default interest rate equal to two percent (2%)
per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable under the Credit and Security Agreement. The Company estimates that
the increased rate currently results in approximately $120
000 additional annual interest expense.


 2014
 MBC and Releta received
a second notice (the &#147;Second Default Notice&#148;) from Lender regarding its intention to exercise certain rights with respect
to events of default of the Company pursuant to the Credit and Security Agreement. The Second Default Notice required MBC and Releta
to engage a consultant to perform a viability analysis and prepare a revised projection for 2014.


 2014
 pursuant
to a notice to MBC and Releta dated August 18
 2014 (the &#147;Third Default Notice&#148;) which referred to MBC&#146;s and
Releta&#146;s continued failure to meet the required fixed charge coverage ratio and the tangible net worth requirement
 Lender
notified MBC and Releta that it would reduce the advance rate for (i) eligible finished goods and raw material inventory and (ii)
eligible work-in progress inventory by 2% each month. The advance rates are used in the calculation of the borrowing base of each
of MBC and Releta
 which is used in the determination of the amount available to each of MBC and Releta pursuant to the revolving
facility. Under the terms of the Credit and Security Agreement
 if such availability is less than $0
 or if certain components
of the borrowing base of each of MBC and Releta fall below certain limits in relation to outstanding revolving loans
 such difference
shall be immediately due and payable.


 2015
 MBC
 Releta
 and
Lender entered into a Second Amendment (the &#147;Second Amendment&#148;) to the Credit and Security Agreement. The Second Amendment
reduced the maximum amount of the Revolver from $4
119
000 to $2
500
000. The Second Amendment also changed the definition of borrowing
base (including by lowering certain advance rates) such that the calculation of the borrowing base will result in a lower number
than it would have if calculated prior to the effectiveness of the Second Amendment. The borrowing base is used in the determination
of the amount available to each borrower (a &#147;Borrower&#148;) pursuant to the Revolver. Pursuant to the Credit and Security
Agreement
 if such availability is less than $0
 or if certain components of the borrowing base fall below certain limits in relation
to outstanding revolving loans
 such difference shall be immediately due and payable.


rate for (i) eligible finished goods and raw material inventory and (ii) eligible work-in progress inventory by two percent (2%)
and continues to reduce each by an additional two percent (2%) on the 20th day of each month thereafter. The advance rates are
used in the calculation of the borrowing base of each Borrower
 which is used in the determination of the amount available to each
Borrower pursuant to the Revolver. As stated above
 if such availability is less than $0
 or if certain components of the borrowing
base fall below certain limits in relation to outstanding revolving loans
 such difference shall be immediately due and payable.


default described in the Default Notice
 the Second Default Notice or the Third Default Notice and has reserved the right to all
other available rights and remedies under the Credit and Security Agreement
 certain other related documents and applicable law.
Lender could declare the full amount owed under the Credit and Security Agreement due and payable at any time for any reason or
no reason. Since receiving the Second Amendment
 the Company has not received any notice or other communication from Lender that
it intends to exercise any other remedies available to it under the Credit and Security Agreement in connection with the events
of default. Lender continues to charge a default interest rate equal to two percent (2%) per annum in excess of the interest rate
otherwise payable under the Credit and Security Agreement. The exercise of additional remedies by Lender may have a material adverse
effect on the Company&#146;s financial condition and the Company&#146;s ability to continue to operate. If it becomes necessary
for MBC and Releta to seek additional financing
 there is no guarantee that MBC and Releta will be able to obtain such financing
on terms favorable to the Company or on any terms.


 2015
 KBEL received
a notice from Royal Bank of Scotland (&#147;RBS)&#148; regarding its intention to terminate the credit line and all other banking
services it currently provides to KBEL on February 26
 2016. RBS subsequently extended the termination date to May 31
 2016. We
have engaged in discussions with a bank which provided an indicative offer to provide a replacement for the RBS line of credit.
It would have a material adverse effect on KBEL and the Company if KBEL is unable to find a substitute replacement before termination
of the RBS facilities.

 UBHL indicated a willingness to invest up to $2
000
000 in the Company. On January 22
 2014
 Catamaran Services
Inc.
 (&#147;Catamaran&#148;)
 a related party (see &#147;Notes Payable to Related Party&#148;
 below)
 provided a note loan
of $500
000 repayable upon receipt of an equity investment by the Company&#146;s majority shareholder. On April 24
 2014
 another
note loan of $500
000 was received from Catamaran on terms similar to the previous note. On February 5
 2015
 another note loan
of $500
000 was received from Catamaran on terms similar to the previous notes. On July 6
 2015
 the proceeds of another note loan
of $500
000 was received from Catamaran on terms similar to the previous notes. On each date on or prior to which Catamaran provided
a note loan
 the Company received a letter from Lender permitting the Company to obtain loans subject to certain conditions
 including
that no portion of such loans would be payable until either (a) certain obligations of the Company to Lender pursuant to the Agreement
were satisfied in full
 or (b) such payment was made from an equity investment by the Company&#146;s majority shareholder.


connection with the Company&#146;s operations
 UBHL
 the Company&#146;s indirect majority shareholder
 issued a letter of comfort
on March 5
 2015 (the &#147;Letter of Comfort&#148;)
 to confirm that UBHL had agreed to provide funding on an as needed basis
to ensure that the Company is able to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. The Letter of Comfort does not
specify either the terms of UBHL&#146;s support
 or a maximum dollar limit and is not a legally binding agreement. However
 to
date UBHL through its affiliated company
 Catamaran
 has provided funds for working capital needs. UBHL&#146;s financial support
is contingent upon compliance with any applicable exchange control requirements
 other applicable laws
 and regulations relating
to the transfer of funds from India. The Letter of Comfort does not specify any time limit for extending support. If it becomes
necessary to seek UBHL&#146;s financial assistance under the Letter of Comfort and UBHL is either unable or unwilling to provide
such financial assistance to MBC
 it may result in a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position and on its
ability to continue operations. UBHL controls the Company&#146;s two largest shareholders
 United Breweries of America
 Inc. (&#147;UBA&#148;)
and Inversiones
 and as such
 is the Company&#146;s indirect majority shareholder. The Company&#146;s Chairman of the Board
Dr. Vijay Mallya
 is also the Chairman of the board of directors of UBHL.


 2015
 the Company engaged
Gordian Group
 LLC (&#147;Gordian Group&#148;) to serve as the Company&#146;s exclusive investment banker to assist the Company
in evaluating
 exploring and
 if deemed appropriate by the Company
 pursuing and implementing certain strategic and financial options
and transactions that may be available to the Company
 including in connection with a possible debt or equity capital financing
merger
 consolidation
 joint venture or other business combination involving
 or sale of substantially all or a material portion
of the assets (outside of the ordinary course of business) or outstanding securities of
 the Company and/or its subsidiaries
 and/or
the acquisition of substantially all or a material portion of the assets or outstanding securities of another entity (each
 a &#147;Financial
Transaction&#148;). Gordian Group is a New York-based independent investment banking firm. While the Company has commenced evaluating
its available options
 no conclusion as to any specific option or transaction has been reached
 nor has any specific timetable
been fixed for this effort
 and there can be no assurance that any strategic or financial option or transaction will be presented
implemented or consummated. The Company intends to use proceeds of the Financial Transaction to repay the amount owed to Lender
when it becomes due.


 2015
 the fixed charge
coverage ratio was required to be 1.15 to 1. The Company calculated that the fixed charge coverage ratio as of December 31
 2015
was -0.28 to 1. The Company calculated that the required tangible net worth of MBC and Releta was $6
181
400 as of December 31
2015 and the actual tangible net worth on such date was $3
738
400. The Company does not anticipate that it will regain compliance
with the required fixed charge coverage ratio or the minimum tangible net worth in the immediate future.


 2015
 the Company had
cash and cash equivalents of $129
600
 an accumulated deficit of $17
395
600
 and a working capital deficit of $11
601
700 due
to losses incurred
 reclassification of debts owing to MB Financial as a result of the default under the Credit and Security Agreement
described above and reclassification of subordinated notes payable to UBA maturing in June 2016. In addition
 the book value of
the Company&#146;s assets was lower than the book value of its liabilities at December 31
 2015.


to reduce the Company&#146;s working capital needs through December 31
 2016
 including reducing discretionary expenditures
 reducing
manpower
 securing additional brewing contracts in an effort to utilize a portion of excess production capacity
 and pursuing export
opportunities. The current revenue from operations are insufficient to meet the working capital needs of the Company over the next
12 months. The Company has requested UBHL to make a capital infusion. If UBHL is unwilling or unable to infuse additional capital
the Company will seek capital from other sources
 including outside investors. If sufficient capital for working capital needs
is not obtained
 the Company may sell some of its operating assets.

 it may result in a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s ability to continue operations. If it becomes
necessary to seek UBHL&#146;s financial assistance under the Letter of Comfort and UBHL does not provide such financial assistance
to MBC
 it may result in a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position and on its ability to continue operations.
In addition
 the Company&#146;s lenders may seek to satisfy any outstanding obligations through recourse against the applicable
pledged collateral which may include the Company&#146;s real property and fixed and current assets. The loss of any material
pledged asset would have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position and results of operations.

 provided
that either the Company or UBA may elect not to extend the term upon written notice given to the other party no more than 60 days
and no fewer than 30 days prior to the expiration of such term. UBA may demand payment within 60 days of the end of the extension
period but is precluded from doing so because the notes are subordinated to long-term debt agreements with MB Financial maturing
in June 2016. The Company expects the UBA notes to be continued to be subordinated to any new financing facility obtained after
maturity of MB Financial facility. The Company will also attempt to induce conversion of UBA notes to equity. Therefore

Trade Accounts Receivable and Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts


at the invoiced amount and are the amount the Company expects to collect. Sales are made to approved customers on an open account
basis
 subject to established credit limits
 and generally no collateral is required. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the
Company&#146;s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Company&#146;s existing accounts receivable; however
changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future.




doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Management considers
the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts: customer credit-worthiness
 past transaction
history with the customer
 current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms. Past due balances over
90 days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectability. If the financial condition of the Company&#146;s
customers were to deteriorate
 adversely affecting their ability to make payments
 additional allowances would be required. Based
on management&#146;s assessment
 the Company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a
credit to a valuation allowance. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are
written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. The Company had allowances of $69
100
and $56
700 for doubtful accounts receivable as of December 31
 2015 and 2014
 respectively.

cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over the assets&#146; estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements
are amortized over the shorter of the life of the improvement or the life of the related lease. The Company uses other depreciation
methods (generally
 accelerated depreciation methods) for tax purposes where appropriate. Costs of maintenance and repairs are
charged to expense as incurred; significant renewals and betterments are capitalized. When property and equipment are retired
sold
 or otherwise disposed of
 the asset&#146;s carrying amount and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
and any gain or loss is included in the statement of operations.

of the lease. Amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of
the assets or the period of the related lease.




of its long-lived assets periodically in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360
 (Accounting
for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets). The Company reviews the carrying value of property and equipment and any
other long-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset
may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases
where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value
 an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount
by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment
include current operating results
 trends
 and prospects
 as well as the effects of obsolescence
 demand
 competition
 and other
economic factors. Long-lived assets that management commits to sell or abandon are reported at the lower of carrying amount or
fair value less cost to sell.








are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related debt. When a loan is paid in full
 any unamortized financing costs
are removed from the related accounts and charged to operations. Deferred financing costs related to borrowing made in June 2011

000 for the years ended December 31
 2015

in accordance with ASC 750 which requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes
and allows recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future
years. Under the asset and liability approach
 deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences
and operating loss
 and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established to reduce the deferred tax asset if it is
more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.


tax positions that the Company has taken or expects to take on a tax return (including a decision whether to file or not to file
a return in a particular jurisdiction). The Company evaluated its tax positions and determined that there were no uncertain tax

taxes on the sale of alcoholic beverages
 including beer. For brewers producing less than 2.0 million barrels of beer per calendar
year
 the federal excise tax is $7 per barrel on the first 60
000 barrels of beer removed for consumption or sale during a calendar
year
 and $18 per barrel for each barrel in excess of 60
000. Individual states also impose excise taxes on alcoholic beverages
in varying amounts
 which have also been subject to change. Sales as presented in the Company&#146;s statements of operations
reflect the amount invoiced to the Company&#146;s wholesalers and other customers. Excise taxes due to federal and state agencies
are not collected from the Company&#146;s customers
 but rather are the responsibility of the Company. Net sales
 as presented
in the Company&#146;s statements of operations
 are reduced by applicable federal and state excise taxes. In the UK
 excise taxes
are paid by the manufacturer and not by the Company.








its products and in response to local competitive conditions
 the Company regularly offers price discounts to distributors and
retailers in most of its markets. Sales for the years 2015 and 2014

are reduced by $1
204
400 and $1
140
800 respectively
 related to such discounts.








for chargebacks for promotional expenses by distributors. The Company estimates its reserves by utilizing historical information
and current contracts. In estimating chargeback reserves
 the Company analyzes actual chargeback amounts and applies historical
chargeback rates to estimate potential chargeback. The Company routinely assesses its experience with distributors and adjusts
the reserves accordingly. If actual chargebacks and other rebates are greater than the Company&#146;s estimates
 additional reserves
may be required. Revisions to estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision
become known.








are somewhat seasonal
 with the first and fourth quarters historically being the slowest and the rest of the year generating stronger
sales. The volume of sales may also be affected by weather conditions. Because of the seasonality of the Company&#146;s business
results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.








remitted to tax authorities are sales tax collected from our retail customers. State and federal excise taxes on beer shipments
are the responsibility of the Company and included in our selling price. Excise taxes on shipments are shown in a separate line
item in the consolidated statement of operations as reduction of gross sales. Sales taxes collected from customers are recognized
as a liability
 with the liability subsequently reduced when the taxes are remitted to the tax authority. Total sales taxes collected
from customers and remitted to tax authorities were not material in 2015 and 2014.








 (Shipping
and Handling Fees and Costs) the company reports pass-through freight costs on beer shipped to independent beer wholesalers in
cost of sales. Reimbursements of these costs by wholesalers are reported in sales.


the Company to deliver beer to wholesalers are included in marketing
 distribution and administrative expenses. These costs are
considered marketing related because in addition to product delivery
 wholesalers provide marketing and other customer service
functions to customers including product display

Shipping costs included in marketing expense totaled $968

and the United Kingdom) (the &#147;Foreign Territory&#148;). The Company evaluates performance based on net operating profit.
Where applicable
 portions of the administrative function expenses are allocated between the operating segments. The operating
segments do not share manufacturing or distribution facilities. In the event any materials and/or services are provided to one
operating segment by the other
 the transaction is valued according to the Company&#146;s transfer policy
 which approximates
market price. The costs of operating the manufacturing plants are captured discretely within each segment. The Company&#146;s
property
 plant and equipment
 inventory
 and accounts receivable are captured and reported discretely within each operating segment.








 the
Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) 2014-08
 &#147;Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205)
and Property
 Plant and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of
an Entity
&#148; which changes the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as discontinued operations and modifies
related disclosure requirements. This ASU was effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15
 2014
 and interim periods
within those years. Early adoption was permitted
 but only for disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that had not been
reported in the financial statements previously issued or available for issuance. See Notes X for disclosures related to this adoption.


 the
company adopted FASB&#146;s guidance on reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity.
This standard raises the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires new disclosures of both discontinued
operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. The guidance is effective for
annual reporting periods ending after December 15
 2014. Early adoption was permitted but only for disposals that have not been
reported in financial statements previously issued. The adoption of this guidance has not had a material impact on its financial
position
 results of operations or cash flows.


 the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01
 which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on
the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for
equity investments
 financial liabilities under the fair value option
 and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial
instruments. In addition
 the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax
assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and
interim periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 and upon adoption
 an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect
adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption
is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting
from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
this guidance.


 the FASB issued (ASU)
2015-17
 Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. Currently deferred taxes for each tax jurisdiction are presented as a
net current asset or liability and net noncurrent asset or liability on the balance sheet. To simplify the presentation
 the new
guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets for all jurisdictions along with any related valuation allowances be
classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 and early adoption is permitted. The Company has adopted this guidance in the fourth
quarter of the year ended December 31
 2015 on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact
on the Company&#146;s financial position
 results of operations or cash flows
 and did not have any effect on prior periods due
to the full valuation allowance against the Company&#146;s net deferred tax assets.


 the FASB issued ASU
2015-16
 Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement &#150;Period Adjustments. Changes to the accounting for measurement-period
adjustments relate to business combinations. Currently
 an acquiring entity is required to retrospectively adjust the balance sheet
amounts of the acquiree recognized at the acquisition date with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill as a result of changes made
to the balance sheet amounts of the acquiree. The measurement period is the period after the acquisition date during which the
acquirer may adjust the balance sheet amounts recognized for a business combination (generally up to one year from the date of
acquisition). The changes eliminate the requirement to make such retrospective adjustments
 and
 instead require the acquiring
entity to record these adjustments in the reporting period they are determined. The new standard is effective for both public and
private companies for periods beginning after December 15
 2015. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this
guidance.


 the FASB issued ASU 2015-11
&#147;Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory
&#148; which applies to inventory that is measured using
first-in
 first-out (&#147;FIFO&#148;) or average cost. Under the updated guidance
 an entity should measure inventory that is
within scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value
 which is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business
less reasonably predictable costs of completion
 disposal and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory
that is measured using last-in
 first-out (&#147;LIFO&#148;). This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning
after December 15
 2016
 and should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted at the beginning of an interim or annual
reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.


 the FASB issued ASU 2015-07
&#147;Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share
(or Its Equivalent)
&#148; which removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which
fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Further
 the amendments remove the requirement
to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share
practical expedient. This ASU is effective for annual periods
 including interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning
after December 15
 2015
 and early adoption is permitted. The new guidance should be applied on a retrospective basis to all periods
presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.


 the FASB issued ASU 2015-05
&#147;Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer&#146;s Accounting for Fees Paid in
a Cloud Computing Arrangement
&#148; which provides guidance about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.
If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license
 the customer should account for the software license element of the
arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software
license
 the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. This ASU is effective for annual periods
 including
interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December 15
 2015
 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.


 the FASB issued guidance
related to a customer&#146;s accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. This standard provides guidance to customers
about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license
then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software
licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license
 the customer should account for the arrangement
as a service contract. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2015
 and
early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt this guidance on January 1
 2016. The adoption of this guidance is not expected
to have a material impact on its financial position
 results of operations or cash flows.


 the FASB issued ASU
2015-02
 &#147;Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis
&#148; which makes changes to both the variable
interest model and voting interest model and eliminates the indefinite deferral of FASB Statement No. 167
 included in ASU 2010-10
for certain investment funds. All reporting entities that hold a variable interest in other legal entities will need to re-evaluate
their consolidation conclusions as well as disclosure requirements. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December
15
 2015
 and early adoption is permitted
 including any interim period. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance
to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.


 the FASB issued ASU
2015-01
 &#147;Income Statement &#150; Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20)
&#148; effective for fiscal years
and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning after December 15
 2015. This update eliminates from GAAP the concept
of extraordinary items. The adoption of ASU 2014-16 will not have a significant impact on the Company&#146;s financial position
or results of operations.


 the FASB issued ASU
2014-16
 &#147;Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815).&#148; Entities commonly raise capital by issuing different classes of shares
including preferred stock
 that entitle the holders to certain preferences and rights over the other shareholders. The specific
terms of those shares may include conversion rights
 redemption rights
 voting rights
 and liquidation and dividend payment preferences
among other features. One or more of those features may meet the definition of a derivative under GAAP. Shares that include such
embedded derivative features are referred to as hybrid financial instruments. The objective of this update is to eliminate the
use of different methods in practice and thereby reduce existing diversity under GAAP in the accounting for hybrid financial instruments
issued in the form of a share. The amendments are effective for fiscal years
 and interim periods within those fiscal years
 beginning
after December 15
 2015. The adoption of ASU 2014-16 will not have a significant impact on the Company&#146;s financial position
or results of operations.


 the FASB issued ASU
2014-15
 &#147;Presentation of Financial Statements &#150; Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)
 effective for the annual period ending
after December 15
 2016
 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. This standard provides
guidance about management&#146;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&#146;s ability
to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods
ending after December 15
 2016
 and early adoption is permitted. The Company expects to adopt this guidance on January 1
 2017.
The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact
 if any
 the adoption of ASU 2014-15 will have on footnote disclosures
however
 the Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have any impact on its financial position
 results of operations
or cash flows.


 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09
&#147;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
&#148; on revenue recognition. This guidance provides that an entity
should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance also requires more detailed
disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash
flows arising from contracts with customers. The original effective date of this guidance was for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 early adoption is not permitted
 and the guidance must be applied retrospectively or
modified retrospectively. In July 2015
 the FASB approved an optional one-year deferral of the effective date. As a result
 we
expect to adopt this guidance on January 1
 2018. The Company has not yet determined its approach to adoption or the impact the
adoption of this guidance will have on its financial position
 results of operations or cash flows
 if any. Other recent accounting
pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force (&#147;EITF&#148;))
 the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (&#147;AICPA&#148;)
 and the SEC did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the
Company&#146;s present or future financial statements.
