General Overview



Products and

roaster and dealer in the United States.&#xA0;&#xA0;Our core
products can be divided into three categories:



Wholesale Green

the world and sold to large and small roasters and coffee shop
operators;





Private Label

 blended
 packaged and
sold under the specifications and names of others
 including
supermarkets that want to have their own brand name on coffee to
compete with national brands; and






coffee roasted and blended to our own specifications and packaged
and sold under our eight proprietary and licensed brand names in
different segments of the market.






private label and branded coffee products are sold throughout the
United States
 Canada and certain countries in Asia to
supermarkets
 wholesalers
 and individually owned and multi-unit
retail customers.&#xA0;&#xA0;Our unprocessed green coffee
 which
includes over 90 specialty coffee offerings
 is sold to specialty
gourmet roasters.




conduct our operations in accordance with strict freshness and
quality standards.&#xA0;&#xA0;All of our private label and branded
coffees are produced from high quality coffee beans that are deep
roasted for full flavor using a slow roasting process that has been
perfected utilizing our more than thirty years of experience in the
coffee industry.&#xA0;&#xA0;In order to ensure freshness
 our
products are delivered to our customers within 72 hours of
roasting.&#xA0;&#xA0;We believe that our long history has enabled
us to develop a loyal customer base.




of 2016
 we acquired substantially all of the assets of Coffee
Kinetics LLC (doing business as Sonofresco) through our
wholly-owned subsidiary Sonofresco
 LLC (&#x201C;Sonofresco&#x201D;)
including equipment
 inventory
 customer lists
relationships and accounts payable. In addition to our
wholesale green coffee
 private label coffee and branded coffee
product offerings
 we currently sell tabletop coffee roasting
equipment to our customers through Sonofresco.

Our Competitive Strengths




achieve our growth objectives described below
 we intend to
leverage the following competitive strengths:



Positioned
to Profitably Grow Through Varying Cycles of the Coffee

companies to offer a broad array of branded and private label
roasted ground coffees and wholesale green coffee across the
spectrum of consumer tastes
 preferences and price
points.&#xA0;&#xA0;While many of our competitors engage in distinct
segments of the coffee business
 we sell products in each of the
following areas:



Retail branded
coffee;





Mainstream retail
private label coffee;





Specialty retail
coffees both private label and branded including organic and fair
trade coffees;





Wholesale specialty
green and gourmet whole bean coffees including organic and fair
trade coffees;





Food
service;
















Instant
coffees;





Tea;
and





Tabletop
coffee roasting equipment.





branded and private label roasted ground coffees are sold at
competitive and value price levels while some of our other branded
and specialty coffees are sold predominantly at premium price
levels.&#xA0;&#xA0;Premium price level coffee is high-quality
gourmet coffee
 such as AA Arabica coffee
 which sell at a
substantial premium over traditional retail canned coffee
 while
competitive and value price level coffee is mainstream or
traditional canned coffee.&#xA0;&#xA0;Because of this
diversification
 we believe that our profitability is not dependent
on any one area of the coffee industry and
 therefore
 is less
sensitive than our competition to potential coffee commodity price
and overall economic volatility.



Wholesale Green Coffee

green coffee
 we believe that we are favorably positioned to
increase our specialty coffee sales.&#xA0;&#xA0;Since 1998
 we have
increased the number of our wholesale green coffee customers
including coffee houses
 single store operators
 mall coffee stores
and mail order sellers
 by 425% from 150 to 787.&#xA0;&#xA0;We are
a charter member of the Specialty Coffee Association of America and
one of the largest distributors of Swiss Water Processed
Decaffeinated Coffees along the east coast.&#xA0;&#xA0;Our over 40
years of experience as a roaster and a dealer of green coffee
allows us to provide our roasting experience as a value added
service to our gourmet roaster customers.&#xA0;&#xA0;The assistance
we provide to our customers includes training
 coffee blending and
market identification.&#xA0;&#xA0;We believe that our relationships
with wholesale green coffee customers and our focus on selling
green coffee as a wholesaler has enabled us to participate in the
growth of the specialty coffee market while mitigating the risks
associated with the competitive retail specialty coffee
environment.



Diverse Portfolio of

portfolio of six proprietary name brands sold to supermarkets
wholesalers and individually owned stores in the United States
including brands for specialty espresso
 Latin espresso
 Italian
espresso
 100% Colombian coffee and blended coffee.&#xA0;&#xA0;In
addition
 we have entered into a licensing agreement with Del Monte
Corporation for the exclusive right to use the S&amp;W and IL
CLASSICO trademarks in the United States and other countries
approved by Del Monte Corporation in connection with the
production
 manufacture and sale of roasted whole bean and ground
coffee for distribution to retail customers.&#xA0; Our existing
portfolio of differentiated brands combined with our management
expertise serve as a platform to add additional name brands through
acquisition or licensing agreements which target product niches and
segments that do not compete with our existing brands.



Management Has Extensive

family-operated business for three
generations.&#xA0;&#xA0;Throughout this time
 we have remained
strong through varying cycles in the coffee industry and the
economy.&#xA0;&#xA0;Andrew Gordon
 our President
 Chief Executive
Officer
 Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
 and David Gordon
our Executive Vice President &#x2013; Operations
 have worked with
Coffee Holding for 34 and 36 years
 respectively.&#xA0;&#xA0;David
Gordon is an original member of the Specialty Coffee Association of
America.&#xA0;&#xA0;We believe that our employees and management
are dedicated to our vision and mission
 which is to produce high
quality products
 as well as to provide quality and responsive
service to our customers.




Our Growth Strategy




believe that significant growth opportunities exist by selectively
pursuing strategic acquisitions and alliances
 targeting the
rapidly growing Hispanic market in the United States
 increasing
penetration with existing customers by adding new products
 and
developing our food service business.&#xA0;&#xA0;By capitalizing on
this strategy
 we hope to continue to grow our business with our
commitment to quality and personalized service to our
customers.&#xA0;&#xA0;We do not intend to compete on price alone
nor do we intend to expand sales at the expense of
profitability.



Selectively Pursue

expanded our operations by acquiring coffee companies
 entering
into strategic alliances and acquiring or licensing brands
 which
complement our business objectives and we intend to continue to
seek such opportunities.&#xA0;&#xA0;



Grow Our Cafe Caribe and

population in the United States is the fastest growing and now
represents the largest minority demographic in the United
States.&#xA0;&#xA0;We believe there is significant opportunity for
our Caf&#xE9; Caribe and Caf&#xE9; Supremo brands to gain market
share among Hispanic consumers in the United
States.&#xA0;&#xA0;Caf&#xE9; Caribe
 which has historically been
our leading brand by poundage
 is a specialty espresso coffee that
targets espresso coffee drinkers and
 in particular
 Hispanic
consumers.&#xA0;&#xA0;Caf&#xE9; Supremo is a specialty espresso
coffee which is priced for the more price sensitive Hispanic
espresso coffee drinker.














Further Market Penetration

additional market share through our existing distribution channels
by selectively adding or introducing new brand names and products
across multiple price points
 including:



Specialty
blends;





Teton
tea;





Private label
&#x201C;value&#x201D; blends;





Specialty instant
coffees;





Sales of our
tabletop coffee roasting equipment;
and





Cold
brew.





Develop Our Food Service

service business by developing new distribution channels for our
products.&#xA0;&#xA0;Currently
 we have a limited presence in the
food service market.&#xA0;&#xA0;Food service coffee products tend
to have a higher gross profit margin than our traditional
supermarket product retail offerings. We have expanded our food
service offerings to include instant cappuccinos
 tea products and
an equipment program for our customers.&#xA0;&#xA0;We attend
various annual trade shows held by different buying groups
 which
provide us a national audience to market our food service
products.



Expansion into China and

 we (i)
introduced our Don Manuel brand for sale in the Shanghai market
through an exclusive licensing arrangement with the DTS8 Coffee
Company
 Ltd.
 (ii) commenced sales of green coffee into China and
(iii) continued to build upon prior sales of our S&amp;W coffee in
certain countries in Asia.&#xA0;&#xA0;We intend to pursue
opportunities to increase sales of our green coffee
 private label
coffee and branded coffee into certain countries in
Asia.




Our Core Products




core products can be divided into three categories:



Wholesale Green

and sold to large
 medium and small roasters and coffee shop
operators;





Private Label

 blended
 packaged and sold under the
specifications and names of others
&#xA0;including supermarkets
that want to have their own brand name on coffee to compete with
national brands; and





Branded
 coffee
roasted and blended to our own specifications and packaged and sold
under our eight proprietary and licensed brand names in different
segments of the market.





Wholesale Green

the fastest growing area of our industry.&#xA0;&#xA0;The number of
gourmet coffee houses have been increasing in all areas of the
United States.&#xA0;&#xA0;The growth in specialty coffee sales has
created a marketplace for higher quality and differentiated
products
 which can be priced at a premium in the
marketplace.&#xA0;&#xA0;As a large roaster-dealer of green coffee
we are favorably positioned to increase our specialty coffee
sales.&#xA0;&#xA0;We sell green coffee beans to small roasters and
coffee shop operators located throughout the United States and
carry over approximately 90 different
varieties.&#xA0;&#xA0;Specialty green coffee beans are sold
unroasted
 direct from warehouses to small roasters and gourmet
coffee shop operators
 which then roast the beans
themselves.&#xA0;&#xA0;We sell from as little as one bag (132
pounds) to a full truckload (44
000 pounds) of specialty green
coffee beans
 depending on the size and need of the
customer.&#xA0;&#xA0;We believe that we can increase sales of
wholesale green coffee without an increase in infrastructure as
well as without venturing into the highly competitive retail
specialty coffee environment.&#xA0;&#xA0;We believe that by
utilizing our current strategy we can be as profitable or more
profitable than our competitors in this segment by selling
&#x201C;one bag at a time&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;one cup at a
time.&#x201D;














Private Label

 blend
 package and sell coffee
under private labels for companies throughout the United States and
Canada.&#xA0;&#xA0;Our private label coffee is sold in cans
 brick
packages and instants in a variety of sizes.&#xA0;&#xA0;As of
October 31
 2016
 we supplied coffee under approximately 26
We produce private label coffee
for customers who desire to sell coffee under their own name but do
not want to engage in the manufacturing process.&#xA0;&#xA0;Our
private label customers seek a quality similar to the national
brands at a lower cost
 which represents a better value for the
consumer.



Branded
&#xA0;&#xA0;We
roast and blend our branded coffee according to our own recipes and
package the coffee at our facilities in La Junta
 Colorado and
Brecksville
 Ohio.&#xA0;&#xA0;We then sell the packaged coffee
under our brand labels to supermarkets
 wholesalers and
individually-owned stores throughout the United
States.

exclusive right to use the S&amp;W

United States in connection with the production

our name brands is directed at a particular segment of the coffee
market.&#xA0;&#xA0;Our branded coffees are:




 a
specialty espresso coffee that targets espresso coffee drinkers
and
 in particular
 the Hispanic consumer market;



Don Manuel

produced from the finest 100% Colombian coffee
beans.&#xA0;&#xA0;Don Manuel is an upscale quality product which
commands a substantial premium compared to the more traditional
brown coffee blends.&#xA0;&#xA0;We also use this known trademark in
our food service business because of the high brand
quality;

 Mellow&#x2019;d Roast and IL CLASSICO lines;




 a

coffee drinkers to the tastes of dark roasted coffee;




 an Italian

Raw Materials




is a commodity traded on the Commodities and Futures Exchange
subject to price fluctuations.&#xA0;&#xA0;Over the past five years
the average price per pound of coffee beans ranged from
approximately $1.03 to $3.05.&#xA0;&#xA0;The price for coffee beans
on the commodities market as of October&#xA0;31
 2016 and 2015 was
$1.64 and $1.21 per pound
 respectively.&#xA0;&#xA0;Specialty green
coffee
 unlike most coffee
 is not tied directly to the commodities
cash markets.&#xA0;&#xA0;Instead
 it tends to trade on a negotiated
basis at a substantial premium over commodity coffee pricing
depending on the origin
 supply and demand at the time of
purchase.&#xA0;&#xA0;We are a licensed Fair Trade dealer for Fair
Trade certified coffee.&#xA0;&#xA0;Fair Trade certified coffee
helps small coffee farmers to increase their incomes and improve
the prospects of their communities and families by guaranteeing
farmers a minimum price of ten cents above the current market
price.&#xA0;&#xA0;Our Ohio Facility operated by Generations Coffee
Company
 LLC (&#x201C;GCC&#x201D;) is certified organic by the
Organic Crop Improvement Association
(&#x201C;OCIA&#x201D;).&#xA0;&#xA0;All of our specialty green
coffees
 as well as all of the other coffees we import for
roasting
 are subject to multiple levels of quality
control.















purchase our green coffee from dealers located primarily within the
United States.&#xA0;&#xA0;The dealers supply us with coffee beans
from many countries
 including Colombia
 Mexico
 Kenya
 Indonesia
Brazil and Uganda.&#xA0;&#xA0;For the fiscal years ended 2016 and
2015
 approximately 43% and 64%
 respectively
 of all of our green
coffee purchases were from five suppliers.&#xA0;&#xA0;One of these
suppliers
 Rothfos Corporation
 accounted for approximately $8.5
million
 or 13%
 in 2016
 and $22.1 million
 or 21%
 in 2015
 of
our total product purchases.&#xA0;&#xA0;An employee of Rothfos
Corporation is one of our directors.&#xA0;&#xA0;We do not have any
formalized
 material agreements or long-term contracts with any of
these suppliers.&#xA0;&#xA0;Rather
 our purchases are typically
made pursuant to individual purchase orders.&#xA0;&#xA0;We do not
believe that the loss of any one supplier
 including Rothfos
 would
have a material adverse effect on our operations due to the
availability of alternate suppliers.




supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are
influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our
control.&#xA0;&#xA0;Supply and price can be affected by factors
such as weather
 politics
 currency fluctuations and economics
within the countries that export coffee.&#xA0;&#xA0;Increases in
the cost of coffee beans can
 to a certain extent
 be passed on to
our customers in the form of higher prices for coffee beans and
processed coffee.&#xA0;&#xA0;Drastic or prolonged increases in
coffee prices may also adversely impact our business as it could
lead to a decline in overall consumption of
coffee.&#xA0;&#xA0;Similarly
 rapid decreases in the cost of coffee
beans may force us to lower our sale prices before realizing cost
reductions in our purchases.




subject all of our private unroasted green coffee to both a
pre-shipment sample approval and an additional sample approval upon
arrival into the United States.&#xA0;&#xA0;Once the arrival sample
is approved
 we then bring the coffee to one of our facilities to
roast and blend according to our own strict
specifications.&#xA0;&#xA0;During the roasting and blending
process
 samples are pulled off the production line and tested on
an hourly basis to ensure that each batch roasted is consistent
with the others and meets the strict quality standards demanded by
our customers and us.




Our Use of Derivatives




supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are
influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our
control.&#xA0;&#xA0;Historically
 we have used
 and intend to
continue to use in a limited capacity
 short-term coffee futures
and options contracts primarily for the purpose of partially
hedging the effects of changing green coffee prices and to reduce
our costs of sales

Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial

 we
acquired
 and expect to continue to acquire
 futures contracts with
longer terms
 generally three to four months
 primarily for the
purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green
coffee.&#xA0;&#xA0;Realized and unrealized gains or losses on
options and futures contracts are reflected in our cost of
sales.&#xA0;&#xA0;Gains on options and futures contracts reduce our
cost of sales and losses on options and futures contracts increase
our cost of sales.&#xA0;&#xA0;The use of these derivative financial
instruments has generally enabled us to mitigate the effect of

 under
normal market conditions
 our hedging policies are a necessary
component of our business model not only in controlling our cost of
sales
 but also giving us the flexibility to obtain the inventory
necessary to continue to grow our sales while trying to minimize
margin compression during a time of historically high coffee
prices.&#xA0;However

pricing risks and we generally remain exposed to losses on futures
contracts when prices decline significantly in a short period of
time
 and we would generally remain exposed to supply risk in the
event of non-performance by the counterparties to any of our

net gains on options and futures contracts in the past
 we incurred
significant losses on options and futures contracts during past
reporting periods in 2015. In those cases
 our cost of sales
increased
 resulting in a decrease in our profitability or increase
in our losses. Such losses have
 and similar losses could in the
future
 materially increase our cost of sales and materially
decrease our profitability and adversely affect our stock price.
See &#x201C;Item 1A &#x2013; Risk Factors - If our hedging policy is
not effective
 we may not be able to control our coffee costs
 we
may be forced to pay greater than market value for green coffee and

design and implement an effective hedging strategy may materially
adversely affect our business and operating results. If the hedges
that we enter do not adequately offset the risks of coffee bean
price volatility or our hedges result in losses
 our cost of sales
may increase
 resulting in a decrease in profitability or increased
losses.&#xA0;&#xA0;As previously announced
 as a result of the
volatile nature of the commodities markets
 we have scaled back our
use of hedging and short-term trading of coffee futures and options
contracts
 and intend to continue to use these practices in a more
limited capacity than we did previously. See &#x201C;Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#x2014;Commodity Price
Risks.&#x201D;




Trademarks




trademarks
 registered with the United States Patent and Trademark
Office
 for all six of our proprietary coffee brands and an
exclusive license for S&amp;W
 IL CLASSICO brands for sale in the
United States.&#xA0;&#xA0;Trademark registrations are subject to
periodic renewal and we anticipate maintaining our
registrations.&#xA0;&#xA0;We believe that our brands are
recognizable in the marketplace and that brand recognition is
important to the success of our branded coffee
business.















Customers




our private label and our branded coffee to some of the largest
retail and wholesale customers in the United States (according to

We sell
wholesale green coffee to GMCR.&#xA0;&#xA0;Sales to GMCR accounted
for approximately $22.6 million or 29% of our net sales for the
fiscal year ended October 31
 2016
 and $63.8 million or 54% for
the fiscal year ended October 31
 2015.




agreements with wholesale customers generally contain only pricing
terms
 our contracts with certain customers also contain minimum
and maximum purchase obligations at fixed
prices.&#xA0;&#xA0;Because our profits on a fixed-price contract
could decline if coffee prices increased
 we acquire futures
contracts with longer terms (generally three to four months)
primarily for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of
green coffee at favorable prices.&#xA0;&#xA0;Although the use of
these derivative financial instruments has generally enabled us to
mitigate the effect of changing prices
 no strategy can entirely
eliminate pricing risks or increased losses and we generally remain
exposed to losses on futures contacts when prices decline
significantly in a short period of time
 and we would generally
remain exposed to supply risk in the event of non-performance by
the counterparties to any futures contracts. See &#x201C;Our Use of
Derivatives.&#x201D;




Marketing




market our private label and wholesale coffee through trade shows
industry publications
 face-to-face contact and through the use of
our internal sales force and non-exclusive independent food and
beverage sales brokers.&#xA0;&#xA0;We also use our web site

products and ourselves.




private label and branded coffees
 we will

 two-for-one sales and new product launches to capture
changing consumer taste preferences for upscale canned
coffees.




evaluate opportunities for growth consistent with our business
objectives.&#xA0;&#xA0;In addition
 we have established
relationships with independent sales brokers to market our products
across the United States

had a high penetration of sales and Canada.&#xA0;&#xA0;We utilize
our in-house sales personnel to market our private label
brands.&#xA0;&#xA0;We intend to capture additional market share in
our existing distribution channels by selectively adding or
introducing new brand names and products across multiple price
points
 including niche specialty blends
 private label
&#x201C;value&#x201D; blends and tea and our own brands
 filter
packages
 and peripheral products.




Charitable Activities




also a supporter of several coffee-oriented charitable
organizations and during fiscal 2016 and 2015
 we donated
approximately $46
000 and $67
000
 respectively
 to
charities.



For over 20 years
we have been members of Coffee Kids
 an international non-profit
organization that helps to improve the quality of life of children
and their families in coffee-growing communities in Mexico
Guatemala
 Nicaragua and Costa Rica.





We are members of
Grounds for Health
 an organization that educates
 screens
 and
arranges treatment for women who have cancer and live in the rural
coffee growing communities of Mexico.





We are a licensed
Fair Trade dealer of Fair Trade certified coffee.&#xA0;&#xA0;Fair
Trade certified coffee helps small coffee farmers to increase their
incomes and improve the prospects of their communities and
families.&#xA0;&#xA0;It guarantees farmers a minimum price of $1.90
per pound.





We are the
administrative benefactors to a non-profit organization called Cup
for Education.&#xA0;&#xA0;After discovering the lack of schools
teachers
 and basic fundamental learning supplies in the poor
coffee growing communities of Central and Latin America
&#x201C;Cup&#x201D; was established by our employee
 Karen Gordon
 to
help build schools
 sponsor teachers
 and purchase basic supplies
such as books
 chalk and other necessities for a proper
education.










coffee market is highly competitive.&#xA0;&#xA0;We compete in the
following areas:














Wholesale Green

throughout the United States.&#xA0;&#xA0;Many of these dealers have
greater financial resources than we do.&#xA0;&#xA0;However
 we
believe that we have both the knowledge and the capability to
assist small specialty gourmet coffee roasters with developing and
growing their businesses.&#xA0;&#xA0;Our over 40 years of
experience as a roaster and a dealer of green coffee allows us to
provide our roasting experience as a value added service to our
gourmet roaster customers.&#xA0;&#xA0;While other coffee merchants
may be able to offer lower prices for coffee beans
 we market
ourselves as a value-added supplier to small roasters
 with the
ability to help them market their specialty coffee products and
develop a customer base.&#xA0;&#xA0;The assistance we provide our
customers includes training
 coffee blending
 market identification
as well as providing access to an extensive variety of coffee
products and inventory.&#xA0;&#xA0;Because specialty green coffee
beans are sold unroasted to small coffee shops and roasters that
market their products to local gourmet customers
 we do not believe
that our specialty green coffee customers compete with our private
label or branded coffee lines of business.&#xA0;&#xA0;We believe
that the addition of Organic Products Trading Company
 LLC
(&#x201C;OPTCO&#x201D;) and Sonofresco as well as our two green
coffee salespersons in South Carolina and Oregon allows us to
compete more effectively throughout the country.



Private Label

coffee for private label sales in the United
States.&#xA0;&#xA0;Many other companies produce coffee for sale on
a regional basis.&#xA0;&#xA0;Our main competitor is the former
retail coffee division of Sara Lee Corporation
 which was purchased
by Segafredo Zanetti Group in 2006
 now known as Massimo Zanetti
Beverage.&#xA0;&#xA0;Massimo Zanetti Beverage is larger and has
more financial and other resources than we do and
 therefore
 is
able to devote more resources to product development and
marketing.&#xA0;&#xA0;We believe that we remain competitive by
providing a higher level of quality and customer
service.&#xA0;&#xA0;This service includes ensuring that the coffee
produced for each label maintains a consistent taste and is
delivered on time and in the proper quantities.&#xA0;&#xA0;In
addition
 we provide our private label customers with information
on the coffee market on a regular basis.



Branded

compete with many other brands that are sold in supermarkets and
specialty stores
 primarily in the Northeastern United
States.&#xA0;&#xA0;The branded coffee market in both the Northeast
and elsewhere is dominated by three large
companies:&#xA0;&#xA0;Kraft General Foods
 Inc. (owner of the
Maxwell House brand)
 Smuckers (owner of the Folgers Caf&#xE9;
Bustelo brands) and Massimo Zanetti Beverage which also markets
specialty coffee in addition to non-specialty
coffee.&#xA0;&#xA0;Our large competitors have greater access to
capital and a greater ability to conduct marketing and
promotions.&#xA0;&#xA0;We believe that
 while our
competitors&#x2019; brands may be more nationally recognizable
 our
Caf&#xE9; Caribe brand is competitive in the fast growing Hispanic
demographic and our S&amp;W brand has been a popular and
recognizable brand on the west coast for over 80
years.&#xA0;




Government Regulation




coffee roasting operations are subject to various governmental laws
and regulations
 which require us to obtain licenses relating to
customs
 health and safety
 building and land use and environmental
protection.&#xA0;&#xA0;Our roasting facility is subject to state
and local air-quality and emissions regulation.&#xA0;&#xA0;If we
encounter difficulties in obtaining any necessary licenses or if we
have difficulty complying with these laws and regulations
 then we
could be subject to fines and penalties
 which could have a
material adverse effect on our profitability.&#xA0;&#xA0;In
addition
 our product offerings could be limited
 thereby reducing
our revenues.




believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all
such laws and regulations and that we have obtained all material
licenses and permits that are required for the operation of our
business.&#xA0;&#xA0;We are not aware of any environmental
regulations that have or that we believe will have a material
adverse effect on our operations.




Employees




70 full-time employees.&#xA0;&#xA0;None of our employees are
represented by unions or collective bargaining
agreements.&#xA0;&#xA0;Our management believes that we maintain
good working relationships with our employees.&#xA0;&#xA0;To
supplement our internal sales staff
 we sometimes engage
independent national and regional sales brokers as independent
contractors who work on a commission basis.

RISK
FACTORS






investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our
business.&#xA0;&#xA0;Before making an investment decision
 you
should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described
below together with all of the other information included in this
report.&#xA0;&#xA0;In addition to the risks and uncertainties
described below
 other risks and uncertainties not currently known
to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may
materially and adversely affect our business
 financial condition
and results of operations.&#xA0;&#xA0;The value or market price of
our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or
other risks
 and you could lose all of your
investment.















Risks affecting our Company



Because our business is
highly dependent upon a single commodity
 coffee
 any decrease in
demand for coffee could materially adversely affect our revenues

essentially one commodity: coffee.&#xA0;&#xA0;Our operations have
primarily focused on the following areas of the coffee
industry:



the roasting
blending
 packaging and distribution of private label
coffee;





the roasting
blending
 packaging and distribution of proprietary branded coffee;
and





the sale of
wholesale specialty green coffee.






for our products is affected by:



consumer tastes and
preferences;





global economic
conditions;





demographic trends;
and





the type
 number
and location of competing products.






we rely on a single commodity
 any decrease in demand for coffee
would harm our business more than if we had more diversified
product offerings and could materially adversely affect our
revenues and operating results.



If we are unable to
geographically expand our branded and private label products
 our
growth will be impeded which could result in reduced sales and

among other things
 geographic expansion of our branded and private
label products as opportunities arise.&#xA0;&#xA0;We may not be
able to implement successfully this portion of our business
strategy.&#xA0;&#xA0;Our ability to implement this portion of our
business strategy is dependent on our ability to:



market our products
on a national scale;





increase our brand
recognition on a national scale;





enter into
distribution and other strategic arrangements with third party
retailers; and





manage growth in
administrative overhead and distribution costs likely to result
from the planned expansion of our distribution
channels.






sales and profitability may be adversely affected if we fail to
successfully expand the geographic distribution of our branded and
private label products.&#xA0;&#xA0;In addition
 our expenses could
increase and our profits could decrease as we implement our growth
strategy.



If our hedging policy is
not effective
 we may not be able to control our coffee costs
 we
may be forced to pay greater than market value for green coffee and

price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced
by numerous factors which are beyond our control.&#xA0;&#xA0;We
have used and expect to continue to use to a lesser extent than
used previously short-term coffee futures and options contracts for
the purpose of hedging the effects of changing green coffee
prices.&#xA0;&#xA0;In addition
 we have acquired and expect to
continue to acquire to a lesser extent than done previously futures
contracts with longer terms
 generally three to four months
 for
the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green
coffee.&#xA0;&#xA0;Realized and unrealized gains or losses on
options and futures contracts are reflected in our cost of
sales.&#xA0;&#xA0;Gains on options and futures contracts reduce our
cost of sales and losses on options and futures contracts increase
our cost of sales.















of these derivative financial instruments has generally enabled us
to mitigate the effect of changing prices. However
 no strategy can
entirely eliminate pricing risks and we generally remain exposed to
losses on futures contracts when prices decline significantly in a
short period of time
 and we would generally remain exposed to
supply risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparties
to any futures contracts.&#xA0;&#xA0;Historically
 we generally
have been able to pass green coffee price increases through to
customers
 thereby maintaining our gross profits
 however
 we may
not be able to pass price increases through to our customers in the
future.&#xA0;&#xA0;Failure to properly design and implement an
effective hedging strategy may materially adversely affect our
business and operating results.&#xA0;&#xA0;If the hedges that we
enter do not adequately offset the risks of coffee bean price
volatility or our hedging results in losses
 our cost of sales may
increase
 resulting in a decrease in profitability or an increase
in losses.&#xA0;&#xA0;Although we have had net gains on options and
futures contracts in the past
 we incurred losses on options and
futures contracts during some reporting periods in
2015.&#xA0;&#xA0;In those cases
 our cost of sales increased
resulting in a decrease in our profitability or an increase in
losses.&#xA0;&#xA0;Such losses have
 and similar losses could in
the future
 could materially increase our cost of sales and
materially decrease our profitability or increase losses and
adversely affect our stock price.



Our revenues and
profitability could be adversely affected if our joint ventures or

historically utilized acquisitions and joint ventures to grow our
business and we intend to continue to seek opportunities for new
joint ventures and acquisitions that will be complementary to our
business. While we believe that our joint ventures will be
successful
 losses in our joint ventures or any future joint
ventures would hurt our profitability. In addition
 we generally
will not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making
authority regarding our joint ventures.&#xA0;&#xA0;Investments in
joint ventures may under certain circumstances
 involve risks not
present when a third party is not involved
 including the
possibility that joint venture partners might become bankrupt or
fail to fund their share of the required capital
contributions.&#xA0;&#xA0;Joint venture partners may have business
interests
 strategies or goals that are inconsistent with our
business interests
 strategies or goals and may be
 in cases where
we have a minority interest
 in a position to take actions contrary
to our policies
 strategies or objectives.&#xA0;&#xA0;Any disputes
that may arise between us and our joint venture partners may result
in litigation or arbitration that could increase our expenses and
could prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their
time and effort exclusively on our business
strategies.&#xA0;&#xA0;In addition
 we may in certain circumstances
be liable for the actions of our third-party joint venture
partners.




including strategic investments or alliances entail numerous risks
which may include:


&#xA0;




integrating acquired operations or products
including the loss of key employees from
 or customers of
 acquired
businesses;






management&#x2019;s attention from our existing
businesses;






on existing business relationships with suppliers
and customers;






of margin and product cost structures different
from those of our current mix of business; and






entering distribution channels
 categories or
markets in which we have limited or no prior
experience.




&#xA0;


failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired
business
 and any adverse consequences associated with our
acquisition activities
 could have a material adverse effect on our
business
 financial condition and operating results.



Any inability to
successfully implement our strategy of growth through selective
acquisitions
 licensing arrangements and other strategic alliances
including joint ventures
 could materially affect our revenues and

utilizes the selective acquisition of coffee companies
 the
selective acquisition or licensing of additional coffee brands and
other strategic alliances including joint ventures
 presents risks
that could result in increased expenditures and could materially
adversely affect our revenues and profitability
including:



such acquisitions
licensing arrangements or other strategic alliances may divert our
management&#x2019;s attention from our existing
operations;





we may not be able
to successfully integrate any acquired coffee companies or new
coffee brands into our existing business;





we may not be able
to manage the contingent risks associated with the past operations
of
 and other unanticipated problems arising in
 any acquired
coffee company; and





we may not be able
to control unanticipated costs associated with such acquisitions
licensing arrangements or strategic alliances.






addition
 any such acquisitions
 licensing arrangements or
strategic alliances may result in:








dilutive issuances of our equity securities;








incurrence of additional debt

















restructuring
charges; and





the recognition of
significant charges for depreciation and amortization related to
intangible assets.





been our practice in the past
 we will continuously evaluate any
such acquisitions
 licensing opportunities or strategic alliances
as they arise.&#xA0;&#xA0;However
 we have not reached any new
agreements or arrangements with respect to any such acquisition
licensing opportunity or strategic alliance (other than those
described herein) at this time and we may not be able to consummate
any acquisitions
 licensing arrangements or strategic alliances on
terms favorable to us or at all.&#xA0;&#xA0;The failure to
consummate any such acquisitions
 licensing arrangements or
strategic alliances may reduce our growth and
expansion.&#xA0;&#xA0;In addition
 if these acquisitions
 licensing
opportunities or strategic alliances are not successful
 our
earnings could be materially adversely affected by increased
expenses and decreased revenues.



The loss of any of our key
customers
 including Keurig Green Mountain
 could negatively affect

dependent upon sales of our products to our key customers
including GMCR
 which accounted for approximately 29% and 54% of
our net sales for the fiscal years ended October 31
 2016 and 2015
respectively.&#xA0; Going forward
 we expect this decrease to
continue. No other customer accounted for greater than 10% of our
net sales during our 2015 and 2016 fiscal years. We generally
do not enter long-term contracts with our customers that are
material to our business.&#xA0;&#xA0;Accordingly
 some of
our customers can stop purchasing our products at any time without
penalty and are free to purchase products from our
competitors.&#xA0;&#xA0;The loss of
 or reduction in sales to our
key customers such as GMCR or any of our other customers to which
we sell a significant amount of our products or any material
adverse change in the financial condition of such customers would
negatively affect our revenues and decrease our
earnings.



If we lose our key
personnel
 including Andrew Gordon and David Gordon
 our revenues

depends to a large degree upon the services of Andrew Gordon
 our
President
 Chief Executive Officer
 Chief Financial Officer and
Treasurer
 and David Gordon
 our Executive Vice President &#x2013;
Operations and Secretary.&#xA0;&#xA0;We also depend to a large
degree on the expertise of our coffee roasters.&#xA0;&#xA0;We do
not have employment contracts with our coffee
roasters.&#xA0;&#xA0;Our ability to source and purchase a
sufficient supply of high quality coffee beans and to roast coffee
beans consistent with our quality standards could suffer if we lose
the services of any of these individuals.&#xA0;&#xA0;As a result
our business and operating results would be adversely
affected.&#xA0;&#xA0;We may not be successful in obtaining and
retaining a replacement for either Andrew Gordon or David Gordon if
they elect to stop working for us.&#xA0;&#xA0;In addition
 we do
not have key-person insurance on the lives of Andrew Gordon or
David Gordon.



Our indebtedness may
adversely affect our ability to obtain additional funds and may
increase our vulnerability to economic or business

 we utilize
borrowings under our credit facility in connection with operations.
Outstanding debt could have important negative consequences to the
holders of our securities
 including the following:





general domestic
and global economic conditions;





a portion of our
cash flow from operations will be needed to pay debt service and
will not be available to fund future operations;





we have increased
vulnerability to adverse general economic and coffee industry
conditions;





we may be
vulnerable to higher interest rates because interest expense on
borrowings under our revolving line of credit is based on variable
rates; and





we may be subject
to covenants that could restrict our operations.






ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our
operations depends on our ability to generate cash in the future.
Our future operating performance is subject to market conditions
and business factors that are beyond our control. If our cash flows
and capital resources are insufficient to allow us to make
scheduled payments on our debt
 we may have to reduce or delay
capital expenditures
 sell assets
 seek additional capital or
restructure or refinance our debt.




Our credit facility contains covenants that place annual
restrictions on our operations
 including covenants relating to
debt restrictions
 capital expenditures
 minimum deposit
restrictions
 tangible net worth
 net profit
 leverage
 employee
loan restrictions
 distribution restrictions (common stock and
preferred stock)
 dividend restrictions
 and restrictions on
intercompany transactions. The credit facility also requires that
we maintain a minimum working capital at all times. There can be no
assurance that we will be in compliance with all covenants in the
future or that we will be able to modify the terms of the credit
facility should that become necessary. Failure to comply with any
of these covenants and restrictions would result in an event of
default under the loan agreement.














If our planned increase in
marketing expenditures fails to promote and enhance our brands
 the
value of our brands could decrease and our revenues and

believe that promoting and enhancing our brands is critical to our
success.&#xA0;&#xA0;We intend to continue to increase our marketing
expenditures and slotting payments to increase retail shelf space
to increase awareness of our brands
 which we expect will create
and maintain brand loyalty.&#xA0;&#xA0;If our brand-building
strategy is unsuccessful
 these expenses
 including the slotting
expenses
 may never be recovered
 and we may be unable to increase
awareness of our brands or protect the value of our
brands.&#xA0;&#xA0;If we are unable to achieve these goals
 our
revenues and ability to implement our business strategy could be
adversely affected.




success in promoting and enhancing our brands will also depend on
our ability to provide customers with high quality products and
service.&#xA0;&#xA0;Although we take measures to ensure that we
sell only fresh roasted coffee
 we have no control over our roasted
coffee products once they are purchased by our
customers.&#xA0;&#xA0;Accordingly
 wholesale customers may store
our coffee for longer periods of time or resell our coffee without
our consent
 in each case
 potentially affecting the quality of the
coffee prepared from our products.&#xA0;&#xA0;Although we believe
we are less susceptible to quality control problems than many of
our competitors because our products are processed in-house under
strict quality control guidelines which have been in place for more
than 30 years
 if consumers do not perceive our products and
service to be of high quality
 then the value of our brands may be
diminished and
 consequently
 our operating results and ability to
implement our business strategy may be adversely
affected.



Our roasting methods are
not proprietary
 so competitors may be able to duplicate them
which could harm our competitive position.&#xA0;&#xA0;If our
competitive position is weakened
 our revenues and profitability

consider our roasting methods essential to the flavor and richness
of our roasted coffee and
 therefore
 essential to our brands of
coffee.&#xA0;&#xA0;Because we do not hold any patents for our
roasting methods
 it may be difficult for us to prevent competitors
from copying our roasting methods if such methods become
known.&#xA0;&#xA0;If our competitors copy our roasting methods
 the
value of our coffee brands may be diminished
 and we may lose
customers to our competitors.&#xA0;&#xA0;In addition
 competitors
may be able to develop roasting methods that are more advanced than
our roasting methods
 which may also harm our competitive
position.




success of our brand also depends in part on our intellectual
property. We rely on a combination of trademarks
 copyrights
service marks
 trade secrets and similar rights to protect our
intellectual property. The success of our growth strategy depends
on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service
marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our
brand in both domestic and international markets. If our efforts to
protect our intellectual property are not adequate
 or if any third
party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property
the value of our brand may be harmed
 which could have a material
adverse effect on our business. We may become engaged in litigation
to protect our intellectual property
 which could result in
substantial costs to us as well as diversion of management
attention.


&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;

Since we rely heavily on
common carriers to ship our coffee on a daily basis
 any disruption
in their services or increase in shipping costs could adversely
affect our relationship with our customers
 which could result in
reduced revenues
 increased operating expenses
 a loss of customers

common carriers to deliver coffee to our customers and to deliver
coffee beans to us.&#xA0;&#xA0;We have no control over these common
carriers and the services provided by them may be interrupted as a
result of labor shortages
 contract disputes and other
factors.&#xA0;&#xA0;If we experience an interruption in these
services
 we may be unable to ship our coffee in a timely manner
which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our
relationship with our customers.&#xA0;&#xA0;In addition
 a delay in
shipping could require us to contract with alternative
 and
possibly more expensive
 common carriers and could cause orders to
be cancelled or receipt of goods to be refused.&#xA0;&#xA0;Any
significant increase in shipping costs could lower our profit
margins or force us to raise prices
 which could cause our revenue
and profits to suffer.



If there was a significant
interruption in the operation of our Colorado facility
 we may not
have the capacity to service all of our customers and we may not be
able to service our customers in a timely manner
 thereby reducing

the continued operations of our Colorado coffee roasting and
distribution facility.&#xA0;&#xA0;Our ability to maintain our
computer and telecommunications equipment in effective working
order and to protect against damage from fire
 natural disaster
power loss
 telecommunications failure or similar events. In
addition
 growth of our customer base may strain or exceed the
capacity of our systems and lead to degradations in performance or
systems failure. Although we continually review and consider
upgrades to our order fulfillment infrastructure and provide for
system redundancies to limit the likelihood of systems overload or
failure
 substantial damage to our systems or a systems failure
that causes interruptions for a number of days could adversely
affect our business. Additionally
 if we are unsuccessful in
updating and expanding our order fulfillment infrastructure
 our
ability to grow may be constrained.&#xA0;&#xA0;As a result
 our
revenues and earnings could be materially adversely
affected.














Prolonged negative economic
conditions could adversely affect us
 our customers and suppliers

subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in general
economic and market conditions.&#xA0;&#xA0;Uncertainty remains in
the United States economy as it continues to recover from a severe
economic recession.&#xA0;&#xA0;The United States economy continues
to experience market volatility
 difficulties in the financial
services sector
 diminished liquidity and availability of credit
concerns regarding inflation
 increases in the costs of
commodities
 continuing high unemployment rates
 reduced consumer
spending and consumer confidence and continuing economic
uncertainties.&#xA0;&#xA0;If the United States economy were to
deteriorate significantly
 our business could be negatively
impacted.



If we fail to continue to
develop and maintain our brand
 our business could

developing our brand is critical to our success and that the
importance of brand recognition may increase as a result of
competitors offering products similar to ours.&#xA0; If our brand
building initiative is unsuccessful
 we may never recover the
expenses incurred in connection with these efforts and we may be
unable to increase our future revenue or implement our business
strategy.&#xA0;&#xA0;Our success in promoting and enhancing our
brand will also depend on our ability to provide customers with
high-quality products and customer service.&#xA0; Although we take
measures to ensure that we sell only fresh roasted coffee
 we have
no control over our coffee products once purchased by
customers.&#xA0; Accordingly
 customers may prepare coffee from our
brands inconsistent with our standards
 store our coffee for long
periods of time or resell our coffee without our consent
 which in
each case
 potentially affects the quality of the coffee prepared
from our products.&#xA0; If customers do not perceive our products
and service to be of high-quality
 then the value of our brand may
be diminished and
 consequently
 our ability to implement our
business strategy may be adversely affected.




Risks related to the coffee industry



Increases in the cost of
high quality Arabica or Robusta coffee beans could reduce our gross

single cost of sales.&#xA0;&#xA0;Coffee is a traded commodity and
in general
 its price can fluctuate depending on:






weather patterns in
coffee-producing countries;






economic and
political conditions affecting coffee-producing countries
including acts of terrorism in such countries;






foreign currency
fluctuations; and






trade regulations
and restrictions between coffee-producing countries and the United
States.






cost of wholesale green coffee increases due to any of these
factors
 our margins could decrease and our profitability could
suffer accordingly.&#xA0;&#xA0;It is expected that coffee prices
will remain volatile in the coming years.&#xA0;&#xA0;Although we
have historically attempted to raise the selling prices of our
products in response to increases in the price of wholesale green
coffee
 when wholesale green coffee prices increase rapidly or to
significantly higher than normal levels
 we are not always able to
pass the price increases through to our customers on a timely
basis
 if at all
 which adversely affects our operating margins and
cash flow.&#xA0;&#xA0;We may not be able to recover any future
increases in the cost of wholesale green coffee.&#xA0;&#xA0;Even if
we are able to recover future increases
 our operating margins and
results of operations may still be materially and adversely
affected by time delays in the implementation of price
increases.



Disruptions in the supply
of green coffee could result in a deterioration of our relationship
with our customers
 decreased revenues or could impair our ability

and its supply is subject to volatility beyond our
control.&#xA0;&#xA0;Supply is affected by many factors in the
coffee growing countries including weather
 pest damage
 economic
conditions
 acts of terrorism
 as well as efforts by coffee growers
to expand or form cartels or associations.&#xA0;&#xA0;In addition
the political situation in many of the Arabica coffee growing
regions
 including Africa
 Indonesia
 and Central and South
America
 can be unstable
 and such instability could affect our
ability to purchase coffee from those regions. If Arabica coffee
beans from a region become unavailable or prohibitively expensive
we could be forced to discontinue particular coffee types and
blends or substitute coffee beans from other regions in our blends.
Frequent substitutions and changes in our coffee product lines
could lead to cost increases
 customer alienation and fluctuations
in our gross margins.




the Arabica coffee beans of the quality we purchase do not trade
directly on the commodity markets.&#xA0;&#xA0;Rather
 we purchase
the high-end Arabica coffee beans that we use on a negotiated
basis.&#xA0;&#xA0;We depend on our relationships with coffee
brokers
 exporters and growers for the supply of our primary raw
material
 high quality Arabica coffee beans.&#xA0;&#xA0;If any of
our relationships with coffee brokers
 exporters or growers
deteriorate
 we may be unable to procure a sufficient quantity of
high quality coffee beans at prices acceptable to us or at
all.&#xA0;&#xA0;In such case
 we may not be able to fulfill the
demand of our existing customers
 supply new retail stores or
expand other channels of distribution.&#xA0;&#xA0;A raw material
shortage could result in a deterioration of our relationship with
our customers
 decreased revenues or could impair our ability to
expand our business.














The coffee industry is
highly competitive and if we cannot compete successfully
 we may
lose our customers or experience reduced sales and

business are highly competitive and competition in these markets
could become increasingly more intense due to the relatively low
barriers of entry.&#xA0;&#xA0;The industry in which we compete is
particularly sensitive to price pressure
 as well as quality
reputation and viability for wholesale and brand loyalty for
retail.&#xA0;&#xA0;To the extent that one or more of our
competitors becomes more successful with respect to any key
competitive factor
 our ability to attract and retain customers
could be materially adversely affected.&#xA0;&#xA0;Our private
label and branded coffee products compete with other manufacturers
of private label coffee and branded coffees.&#xA0;&#xA0;These
competitors
 such as Kraft General Foods
 Inc. (owner of the
Maxwell House brand)
&#xA0;&#xA0;Smuckers (owner of the Folgers
Caf&#xE9; Bustelo brands)
 and Massimo Zanetti Beverage
 have much
greater financial
 marketing
 distribution
 management and other
resources than we do for marketing
 promotions and geographic and
market expansion.&#xA0;&#xA0;In addition
 there are a growing
number of specialty coffee companies who provide specialty green
coffee and roasted coffee for retail sale.&#xA0;&#xA0;If we are
unable to compete successfully against existing and new
competitors
 we may lose our customers or experience reduced sales
and profitability.



Besides coffee
 we face
exposure to other commodity cost fluctuations
 which could impair

costs discussed in the risk factor above
 we are exposed to cost
fluctuation in other commodities
 including
 in particular
 steel
natural gas and gasoline.&#xA0; In addition
 an increase in the
cost of fuel could indirectly lead to higher electricity costs
transportation costs and other commodity costs. Much like coffee
costs
 the costs of these commodities depend on various factors
beyond our control
 including economic and political conditions
foreign currency fluctuations
 and global weather patterns. To the
extent we are unable to pass along such costs to our customers
through price increases
 our margins and profitability will
decrease.



Adverse public or medical
opinion about caffeine may harm our

active compounds
 the health effects of some of which are not fully
understood.&#xA0; A number of research studies conclude or suggest
that excessive consumption of caffeine may lead to increased heart
rate
 nausea and vomiting
 restlessness and anxiety
 depression
headaches
 tremors
 sleeplessness and other adverse health
effects.&#xA0; An unfavorable report on the health effects of
caffeine or other compounds present in coffee could significantly
reduce the demand for coffee
 which could harm our business and
reduce our sales and profits. In addition
 we could become subject
to litigation relating to the existence of such compounds in our
coffee; litigation that could be costly and could divert management
attention.




Risks related to our common stock



Our operating results may
fluctuate significantly
 which makes our results of operations
difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations to

may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year as a result
of a number of factors
 many of which are outside of our
control.&#xA0;&#xA0;These fluctuations could be caused by a number
of factors including:



fluctuations in
purchase prices and supply of green coffee;





fluctuations in the
selling prices of our products;





the level of
marketing and pricing competition from existing or new competitors
in the coffee industry;





the success of our
hedging strategy;





our ability to
retain existing customers and attract new customers;
and





our ability to
manage inventory and fulfillment operations and maintain gross
margins.






result of the foregoing
 period-to-period comparisons of our
operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and those
comparisons should not be relied upon as indicators of future
performance.&#xA0;&#xA0;Accordingly
 our operating results in
future quarters may be below market expectations.&#xA0;&#xA0;In
this event
 the price of our common stock may decline.

Overview




an integrated wholesale coffee roaster and dealer in the United
States and one of the few coffee companies that offers a broad
array of coffee products across the entire spectrum of consumer
tastes
 preferences and price points.&#xA0;&#xA0;As a result
 we
believe that we are well-positioned to increase our profitability
and endure potential coffee price volatility throughout varying
cycles of the coffee market and economic conditions.





Our operations have
primarily focused on the following areas of the coffee
industry:





the sale of
wholesale specialty green coffee;





the roasting
blending
 packaging and sale of private label coffee;





the roasting
blending
 packaging and sale of our eight brands of coffee;
and





sales of our
tabletop coffee roasting equipment.








Our operating
results are affected by a number of factors including:





the level of
marketing and pricing competition from existing or new competitors
in the coffee industry;





our ability to
retain existing customers and attract new customers;





our hedging
policy;





fluctuations in
purchase prices and supply of green coffee and in the selling
prices of our products; and





our ability to
manage inventory and fulfillment operations and maintain gross
margins.






sales are driven primarily by the success of our sales and
marketing efforts and our ability to retain existing customers and
attract new customers.&#xA0;&#xA0;For this reason
 we have made
and will continue to evaluate
 strategic decisions to invest in
measures that are expected to increase net sales.&#xA0;&#xA0;These
transactions include our acquisition of Premier Roasters
 LLC
including equipment and a roasting facility in La Junta
 Colorado
the addition of a west coast sales manager to increase sales of our
private label and branded coffees to new customers
 our joint
venture with Caruso&#x2019;s Coffee
 Inc. of Brecksville
 Ohio
 the
transaction with OPTCO
 the transaction with Sonofresco and our
licensing arrangement with DTS8 Coffee Company
 Ltd. We believe
these efforts will allow us to expand or business.




sales are affected by the price of green coffee.&#xA0;&#xA0;We
purchase our green coffee from dealers located primarily within the
United States.&#xA0;&#xA0;The dealers supply us with coffee beans
from many countries
 including Colombia
 Mexico
 Kenya
 Indonesia
Brazil and Uganda.&#xA0;&#xA0;The supply and price of coffee beans
are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors
which are beyond our control.&#xA0;&#xA0;For example
 in Brazil
which produces approximately 35% of the world&#x2019;s green coffee
the coffee crops are historically susceptible to frost in June and
July and drought in September
 October and
November.&#xA0;&#xA0;However
 because we purchase coffee from a
number of countries and are able to freely substitute one
country&#x2019;s coffee for another in our products
 price
fluctuations in one country generally have not had a material
impact on the price we pay for coffee.&#xA0;&#xA0;Accordingly
price fluctuations in one country generally have not had a material
effect on our results of operations
 liquidity and capital
resources.&#xA0;&#xA0;Historically
 because we generally have been
able to pass green coffee price increases through to customers
increased prices of green coffee generally result in increased net
sales.




supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are
influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our
control.&#xA0;&#xA0;Historically
 we have used
 and intend to
continue to use in a limited capacity
 short-term coffee futures
and options contracts primarily for the purpose of partially
hedging the effects of changing green coffee prices

Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial

 we
acquired
 and expect to continue to acquire
 futures contracts with
longer terms
 generally three to four months
 primarily for the
purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green
coffee.&#xA0;&#xA0;Realized and unrealized gains or losses on
options and futures contracts are reflected in our cost of
sales.&#xA0;&#xA0;Gains on options and futures contracts reduce our
cost of sales and losses on options and futures contracts increase
our cost of sales.&#xA0;&#xA0;The use of these derivative financial
instruments has generally enabled us to mitigate the effect of

 in
normal economic times
 our hedging policies remain a vital element
to our business model not only in controlling our cost of sales
but also giving us the flexibility to obtain the inventory
necessary to continue to grow our sales while trying to minimize
margin compression during a time of historically high coffee
prices.&#xA0;However

pricing risks and we generally remain exposed to losses on futures
contracts when prices decline significantly in a short period of
time
 and we would generally remain exposed to supply risk in the
event of non-performance by the counterparties to any of our

net gains on options and futures contracts in the past
 we have
incurred significant losses on options and futures contracts during
some recent reporting periods. In these cases
 our cost of sales
has increased
 resulting in a decrease in our profitability or
increase our losses. Such losses have and could in the future
materially increase our cost of sales and materially decrease our
profitability and adversely affect our stock price. See &#x201C;Item
1A &#x2013; Risk Factors - If our hedging policy is not effective
we may not be able to control our coffee costs
 we may be forced to
pay greater than market value for green coffee and our

design and implement an effective hedging strategy may materially
adversely affect our business and operating results. If the hedges
that we enter do not adequately offset the risks of coffee bean
price volatility or our hedges result in losses
 our cost of sales
may increase
 resulting in a decrease in profitability or increased
losses.&#xA0;&#xA0;As previously announced
 as a result of the
volatile nature of the commodities markets
 we have and are
continuing to scale back our use of hedging and short-term trading
of coffee futures and options contracts
 and intend to continue to
use these practices in a limited capacity going
forward.















Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates




preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (&#x201C;U.S. GAAP&#x201D;) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying
notes.&#xA0;&#xA0;Estimates are used for
 but not limited to
 the
accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts
 inventories
assets held for sale
 income taxes
 commodities held and loss
contingencies.&#xA0;&#xA0;Management bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances.&#xA0;&#xA0;Actual results could differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.




believe the following critical accounting policies
 among others
may be impacted significantly by judgment
 assumptions and
estimates used in the preparation of the financial
statements:



We recognize
revenue in accordance with the relevant authoritative
guidance.&#xA0;&#xA0;Revenue is recognized at the point title and
risk of ownership transfers to its customers which is upon the
shippers taking possession of the goods because i) title passes in
accordance with the terms of the purchase orders and with our
agreements with our customers
 ii) any risk of loss is covered by
the customers&#x2019; insurance
 iii) there is persuasive evidence
of a sales arrangement
 iv) the sales price is determinable and v)
collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably
assured.&#xA0;&#xA0;Thus
 revenue is recognized at the point of
shipment.





Our allowance for
doubtful accounts is maintained to provide for losses arising from
customers&#x2019; inability to make required payments.&#xA0;&#xA0;If
there is deterioration of our customers&#x2019; credit worthiness
and/or there is an increase in the length of time that the
receivables are past due greater than the historical assumptions
used
 additional allowances may be required.&#xA0;&#xA0;For
example
 every additional one percent of our accounts receivable
that becomes uncollectible
 would decrease our operating income by
approximately $135
000 for the year ended October 31
2016.&#xA0;&#xA0;The reserve for sales discounts represents the
estimated discount that customers will take upon
payment.&#xA0;&#xA0;The reserve for other allowances represents the
estimated amount of returns
 slotting fees and volume based
discounts estimated to be incurred by us from our
customers.





Inventories are
stated at lower of cost (determined on a first-in
 first-out basis)
or market.&#xA0;&#xA0;Based on our assumptions about future demand
and market conditions
 inventories are subject to be written-down
to market value.&#xA0;&#xA0;If our assumptions about future demand
change and/or actual market conditions are less favorable than
those projected
 additional write-downs of inventories may be
required.&#xA0;&#xA0;Each additional one percent of potential
inventory writedown would have decreased operating income by
approximately $142
000 for the year ended October 31
2016.







The commodities
held at broker represent the market value of the Company&#x2019;s
trading account
 which consists of option and futures contracts for
coffee held with a brokerage firm. We use options and futures
contracts
 which are not designated or qualifying as hedging
instruments
 to partially hedge the effects of fluctuations in the
price of green coffee beans. Options and futures contracts are
recognized at fair value in the consolidated financial statements
with current recognition of gains and losses on such positions. We
classify options and futures contracts as trading securities and
accordingly
 unrealized holding gains and losses are included in
earnings. We record realized and unrealized gains and losses in our
cost of sales in the statement of operations/income.





We account for
income taxes in accordance with the relevant authoritative
guidance.&#xA0;&#xA0;Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
computed for temporary differences between the financial statement
and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable
or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which the differences are expected to
reverse.&#xA0;&#xA0;Deferred tax assets are reflected on the
balance sheet when it is determined that it is more likely than not
that the asset will be realized.&#xA0;


















Our goodwill
consists of the cost in excess of the fair market value of the
acquired net assets of OPTCO and Sonofresco
 which&#xA0;has been
integrated into a structure that does not provide the basis for
separate reporting units. Consequently
 we are a single reporting
unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes. We also have
intangible assets consisting of our customer lists and
relationships and trademarks acquired from OPTCO and Sonofesco. At
October 31
 2016 our balance sheet reflected goodwill and
intangible assets as set forth below:

trademarks which are deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to
annual impairment tests. Goodwill impairment tests require the
comparison of the fair value and carrying value of reporting units.
We assess the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible
assets annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. Upon completion of such review
 if impairment is found
to have occurred
 a corresponding charge will be recorded. The
value assigned to the customer list and relationships is being
amortized over a twenty year period.




the Company is a single reporting unit
 the closing NASDAQ Capital
Market price of our common stock as of the acquisition date was
used as a basis to measure the fair value of goodwill. Goodwill and
the intangible assets will be tested annually at the end of each
fiscal year to determine whether they have been impaired. Upon
completion of each annual review
 there can be no assurance that a
material charge will not be recorded. Impairment testing is
required more often than annually if an event or circumstance
indicates that an impairment or decline in value may have
occurred.

2015.&#xA0;&#xA0;Gross profit as a percentage of net sales
increased to 
15% for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2016 from

margins on our wholesale and roasted business as well as a decrease
in our losses period to period on our hedging operations.

 a decrease of $8
752 from
$155
858 for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2015.&#xA0;&#xA0;The
decrease in other expense was attributable to a decrease in
interest expense of $12
764 partially offset by an increase in our
loss from our equity investments of $139 and a
decrease in interest income of $3
873
 during the
fiscal year ended October 31

Income (Loss) Before Taxes

had income of $3
715
962 before income taxes and non-controlling
interest in subsidiary for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2016
compared to a net loss of $(2
093
177) for the fiscal year ended
October 31
 2015
 resulting in a net change of $5
809
139 for the
year ended October 31
 2016.&#xA0;&#xA0;The increase was primarily
attributable to our decreased realized trading loss.



Income
&#xA0;&#xA0;Our
provision (benefit) for income taxes for the fiscal year ended
October 31
 2016 totaled $1
365
920 compared to a benefit of
$(763
647) for the fiscal year ended October 31
2015.&#xA0;&#xA0;The change was attributable to the difference in
the gain for the year ended October 31
 2016 versus the loss in the
fiscal year ended October 31
 2015. The Company&#x2019;s effective
tax rate for the year ended October 31
 2016 was 37% compared to

 2015.



Net Income

of $(1

 or $(0.23) per share basic and diluted for the
fiscal year ended October 31
 2015. The increase in net income was
due primarily to the reasons described above.




Liquidity and Capital Resources




October 31
 2016
 we had working capital of $21
669

 which
represented a $265
035 decrease from our working capital of

 and total stockholders&#x2019;
equity of $24

414 from
our total stockholders&#x2019; equity of $24
081
793 as of October
31
 2015.&#xA0;&#xA0;Our working capital decreased primarily due

121 as of
October 31
 2015.&#xA0;&#xA0;Total stockholders&#x2019; equity
increased due to our net income
 partially offset by our Share

March 10
 2015
 we entered into a loan modification agreement (the
&#x201C;Modification Agreement&#x201D;) with our lender Sterling
National Bank (&#x201C;Sterling&#x201D;) which modified the terms of
the financing agreement with Sterling previously entered into on
February 17
 2009 (the &#x201C;Financing Agreement&#x201D;). Prior to
the Modification Agreement
 the Financing Agreement
 as amended
provided for a credit facility in which we had a revolving line of
credit for a maximum of $7
000
000 (the &#x201C;Loan
Facility&#x201D;). On February 3
 2011
 we amended the Financing
Agreement to create a sublimit within the revolving line of credit
in the form of a $300
000 term loan for the benefit of GCC. The
Financing Agreement was set to expire on March 31
 2015. Pursuant
to the Modification Agreement
 the Financing Agreement was modified
to
 among other things
 (i) extend the term of the Financing
Agreement until February 28
 2017; (ii) increase the maximum amount
of the Loan Facility from $7
000
000 to $9
000
000; (iii) reduce
the interest rate on the average unpaid balance of the line of
credit from an interest rate equal to a per annum reference rate of
3.75% to an interest rate per annum equal to the Wall Street
Journal Prime Rate; and (iv) require us to pay
 upon the occurrence
of certain termination events
 a prepayment premium of 0.50% of the
maximum amount of the credit facility in effect as of the date of
the termination event.




than as described above
 the Financing Agreement remains in full
force and effect. Pursuant to the Modification Agreement
 we are
able to draw on the loan Facility up to an amount of 85% of
eligible accounts receivable and 25% of eligible inventory
consisting of green coffee beans and finished coffee not to exceed
$1
000
000. The Loan Facility is secured by all tangible and
intangible assets of the Company.




Loan Facility contains covenants that place annual restrictions on
our operations
 including covenants related to debt restrictions
capital expenditures
 minimum deposit restrictions
 tangible net
worth
 net profit
 leverage
 employee loan restrictions
distribution restrictions (common stock and preferred stock)
dividend restrictions
 and restrictive transactions. The Loan
Facility also requires that we maintain a minimum working capital
at all times. The Company was in compliance with all required
financial covenants at October 31
 2016 and October 31
2015.




October 31
 2016 and 2015
 the outstanding balance under the bank
line of credit was $5
121
375 and $4
317
121
respectively.















Also on March 10
 2015
 we
 as guarantor
 and OPTCO (the
&#x201C;Borrower&#x201D;)
 as borrower
 entered into a new loan
facility agreement with Sterling. The new loan facility is a
revolving line of credit for a maximum of $3
000
000 (the
&#x201C;New Loan Facility&#x201D;)
 including a letter of credit in
the amount of $286
855. The New Loan Facility terminates on
February 28
 2017.&#xA0; The Borrower is able to draw on the New
Loan Facility at an amount up to 85% of eligible accounts
receivable
 not to exceed 25% of all accounts of the
Borrower.&#xA0;&#xA0;The New Loan Facility is payable monthly in
arrears on the average unpaid balance of the line of credit at an
interest rate per annum equal to the Wall Street Journal Prime
Rate&#xA0;&#xA0;(currently 3.5%).&#xA0;The New Loan Facility is
secured by all tangible and intangible assets of the Company. In
connection with the New Loan Facility
 the Company entered into a
security agreement with Sterling and provided Sterling with a
guarantee of the Borrower&#x2019;s obligations.




October 31
 2016 and 2015
 the outstanding balance under the New
Loan Facility was $1
837
000 and $1
237
000
respectively.

activities was due to our increased outlays for equipment and our
acquisition of Sonofresco during fiscal year 2016.

 our financing activities used
net cash of $450
624 compared to net cash provided by financing

748
813 for the fiscal year ended October 31
2015.&#xA0;&#xA0;The change in cash flow from financing activities
for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2016 was due to our decreased
net borrowing of $1
651

$20
000.

ITEM
7A.&#xA0;
QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK






risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in
interest rates and commodity prices as further described
below.




We are subject to market risk
from exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.&#xA0;&#xA0;As of
October 31
 2016
 our debt consisted of $6
958
375 of variable rate
debt under our revolving line of credit.&#xA0;&#xA0;Our line of
credit provides for a maximum of $12
000
000 and is payable monthly
in arrears on the average unpaid balance of the line of credit at
an interest rate equal to a per annum reference rate (currently
3.5%). This loan is secured by all tangible and intangible assets
of the Company.




&#xA0;The supply and price of
coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by
numerous factors which are beyond our
control.&#xA0;&#xA0;Historically
 we have used
 and intend to
continue to use in a limited capacity
 short-term coffee futures
and options contracts primarily for the purpose of partially
hedging the effects of changing green coffee prices

Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial

 we
acquired
 and expect to continue to acquire
 futures contracts with
longer terms
 generally three to four months
 primarily for the
purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green
coffee.&#xA0;&#xA0;Realized and unrealized gains or losses on
options and futures contracts are reflected in our cost of
sales.&#xA0;&#xA0;Gains on options and futures contracts reduce our
cost of sales and losses on options and futures contracts increase
our cost of sales.&#xA0;&#xA0;The use of these derivative financial
instruments has generally enabled us to mitigate the effect of

 under
normal market conditions
 our hedging policies are a necessary
component of our business model not only in controlling our cost of
sales
 but also giving us the flexibility to obtain the inventory
necessary to continue to grow our sales while trying to minimize
margin compression during a time of historically high coffee
prices.&#xA0;However

pricing risks and we generally remain exposed to losses on futures
contracts when prices decline significantly in a short period of
time
 and we would generally remain exposed to supply risk in the
event of non-performance by the counterparties to any of our

net gains on options and futures contracts in the past
 we have
incurred significant losses on options and futures contracts during
past reporting periods in 2015. In those cases
 our cost of sales
increased
 resulting in a decrease in our profitability or increase
in our losses. Such losses have
 and similar losses could
 in the
future materially increase our cost of sales and materially
decrease our profitability and adversely affect our stock price.
See &#x201C;Item 1A &#x2013; Risk Factors - If our hedging policy is
not effective
 we may not be able to control our coffee costs
 we
may be forced to pay greater than market value for green coffee and

design and implement an effective hedging strategy may materially
adversely affect our business and operating results. If the hedges
that we enter do not adequately offset the risks of coffee bean
price volatility or our hedges result in losses
 our cost of sales
may increase
 resulting in a decrease in profitability or increased
losses.&#xA0;&#xA0;As previously announced
 as a result of the
volatile nature of the commodities markets
 we have and are
continuing to scale back our use of hedging and short-term trading
of coffee futures and options contracts
 and intend to continue to
use these practices in a more limited capacity than we did
previously. See &#x201C;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk&#x2014;Commodity Price Risks.&#x201D;















October 31
 2016
 we held 22 futures contracts for the purchase of
825
000 pounds of green coffee at a weighted average price of $1.45
per pound compared to 38 futures contracts for the purchase of
1
425
000 pounds of coffee at a weighted average price of $1.23 per
pound for the fiscal year ended October 31
 2015. The fair market
value of coffee applicable to such contracts was $1.64 and $1.21
per pound
 respectively. At October 31
 2016
 we did not hold any
options. At October 31
 2015
 we also held 20 options covering an
aggregate of 750
000 pounds of green coffee beans at $1.25 per
pound. The fair market value of these options
 was $42
750 at
October 31
 2015.

NOTE 1 - BUSINESS ACTIVITIES:




Holding Co.
 Inc. (the &#x201C;Company&#x201D;) conducts wholesale
coffee operations
 including manufacturing
 roasting
 packaging
marketing and distributing roasted and blended coffees for private
labeled accounts and its own brands
 and it sells green
coffee.&#xA0;&#xA0;The Company also manufactures and sells coffee
roasters. The Company&#x2019;s core product
 coffee
 can be
summarized and divided into three product categories
(&#x201C;product lines&#x201D;) as follows:



Wholesale Green

the world and sold to large and small roasters and coffee shop
operators;



Private Label

 blended
 packaged and sold under the
specifications and names of others
 including supermarkets that
want to have their own brand name on coffee to compete with
national brands; and




coffee roasted and blended to the Company&#x2019;s own
specifications and packaged and sold under the Company&#x2019;s
eight proprietary and licensed brand names in different segments of
the market.




Company&#x2019;s private label and branded coffee sales are
primarily to customers that are located throughout the United
States with limited sales in Canada and certain countries in
Asia.&#xA0;&#xA0;Such customers include supermarkets
 wholesalers
and individually-owned and multi-unit retailers.&#xA0;&#xA0;The
Company&#x2019;s unprocessed green coffee
 which includes over 90
specialty coffee offerings
 is sold primarily to specialty gourmet
roasters and to coffee shop operators in the United States with
limited sales in Australia
 Canada
 England and China.




Company&#x2019;s wholesale green
 private label
 and branded coffee
product categories generate revenues and cost of sales individually
but incur selling
 general and administrative expenses in the
aggregate. There are no individual product managers and discrete
financial information is not available for any of the product
lines. The Company&#x2019;s product portfolio is used in one
business and it operates and competes in one business activity and
economic environment. In addition
 the three product lines share
customers
 manufacturing resources
 sales channels
 and marketing
support.




the Company considers the three product lines to be one single
reporting segment.

conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (&#x201C;U.S. GAAP&#x201D;) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain
reported amounts and disclosures. Significant estimates include
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable and reserves
inventory obsolescence
 depreciation
 intangible asset valuations
and useful lives
 taxes
 contingencies
 and valuation of financial
instruments. These estimates may be adjusted as more current
information becomes available
 and any adjustment could have a
significant impact on recorded amounts.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(cont&#x2019;d):




GREEN COFFEE:




coffee is an item that emanates from OPTCO. The balance represents
advance payments made by OPTCO to several coffee growing
cooperatives for the purchase of green coffee. Interest is charged
to the cooperatives for these advances. Interest earned was $41
176
and $45
049 as of October 31
 2016 and 2015
 respectively. The
prepaid coffee balance was $435
577 and $620
452 as of October 31
2016 and 2015
 respectively.




RECEIVABLE:




accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to
collect. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for
estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to
make required payments. Management considers the following factors
when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts:
customer credit-worthiness
 past transaction history with the
customer
 current economic industry trends
 and changes in customer
payment terms. Past due balances over 60 days and other higher risk
amounts are reviewed individually for collectability. If the
financial condition of the Company&#x2019;s customers were to
deteriorate
 adversely affecting their ability to make payments
additional allowances would be required. Based on
management&#x2019;s assessment
 the Company provides for estimated
uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to
a valuation allowance. Balances that remain outstanding after the
Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off
through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to
accounts receivable.




reserve for sales discounts represents the estimated discount that
customers will take upon payment. The reserve for other allowances
represents the estimated amount of returns
 slotting fees and
volume based discounts estimated to be incurred by the Company from
its customers. The allowances are summarized as

AND EQUIPMENT:




equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Purchases of machinery and equipment and additions and betterments
which substantially extend the useful life of an asset are
capitalized at cost. Expenditures which do not materially prolong
the normal useful life of an asset are charged to operations as
incurred. The Company also provides for amortization of leasehold
improvements.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(cont&#x2019;d):




AND TRADEMARKS:




Company has determined that its goodwill and trademarks
 which
consist of product lines
 trade names and packaging designs have an
indefinite useful life. The value of the goodwill and trademarks
was allocated based on an independent valuation. Goodwill and
trademarks are not amortized but are assigned to a specific
reporting unit or asset class and tested for impairment at least
annually or upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances
indicate that the reporting unit&#x2019;s carrying amount of
goodwill and trademarks is greater than its fair value. As of
October 31
 2016 and 2015
 the Company has determined by using a
qualitative assessment that an impairment did not exist. In 2011
the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard ASB ASU 2011-08
Intangibles &#x2013; Goodwill and Other &#x2013; Testing Goodwill for
Impairment
 which allows an entity to first assess qualitative
factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the
two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under this
amendment
 an entity would not be required to calculate the fair
value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines
 based on a
qualitative assessment
 that it is more likely than not that its
fair value is less than its carrying amount. The amendment includes
a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in
conducting the qualitative assessment.




LIST AND RELATIONSHIPS:




relationships consist of a specific customer lists and customer
contracts obtained by the Company in the acquisition of OPTCO and
Sono which are being amortized on the straight-line method over
their estimated useful life of twenty years.








Company expenses the cost of advertising and promotion as incurred.
Advertising costs charged to operations totaled $170
774 and
$157
922 for the years ended October 31
 2016 and 2015
respectively.




TAXES:




income taxes pursuant to the asset
deferred income tax assets and
liabilities to be computed for temporary differences between the
financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that
will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on
enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the
differences are expected to affect taxable income. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are individually classified as current or
non-current based on their characteristics. Valuation allowances
are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amount expected to be realized. The income tax provision or benefit
is the tax incurred for the period plus or minus the change during
the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.




PER SHARE:




earnings per common share were computed by dividing net income by
the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by
dividing the net income by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of common shares
issuable upon exercise of potential sources of
dilution.




weighted average common shares outstanding used in the computation
of basic and diluted earnings per share were 6

NOTE 2 -SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(cont&#x2019;d):




VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:




carrying amounts of cash
 accounts receivable
 notes receivable
accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value
because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying
amount of the bank line of credit borrowings approximates fair
value because the debt is based on current rates at which the
Company could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities. Fair
value estimates are made at a specific point in time
 based on
relevant market information about the financial instruments when
available. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve
uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore
cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could
significantly affect the estimates.




RECOGNITION:




Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the authoritative
guidance. Revenue is recognized at the point title and risk of
ownership transfers to its customers upon the Company&#x2019;s
shippers taking possession of the goods at the time of shipment
because i) title passes in accordance with the terms of the
Company&#x2019;s purchase orders and with its agreements with its
customers
 ii) any risk of loss is covered by the Company&#x2019;s
customers&#x2019; insurance
 iii) there is persuasive evidence of a
sales arrangement
 iv) the sales price is determinable and v)
collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Thus
revenue is recognized at the point of shipment to its
customers.




Company does not accept returns for damaged goods on packaged
coffee and usable green coffee
 as the customer takes possession of
our product at the point of shipment. In the event a customer
claims receipt of damaged goods
 the Company
 acting as an agent on
behalf of the customer
 may file a claim for reimbursement with the
shipper. The Company is not obligated or required to act as an
agent on behalf of its customers
 but may make the business
decision to do so as a convenience to its customers. The shipper
keeps the damaged product. The Company will then ship a completely
new order to the customer once a claim has been filed and the
Company receives reimbursement or credit from the shipper for the
initial shipment. The Company does evaluate the need
 if any
 of an
accrual for returns for damaged goods. To date
 returns for damaged
goods have been immaterial. The Company estimates that
 based on
historical trends
 that future returns for damaged goods should
also be immaterial.




event that the Company ships an incorrect order or has returns for
short dated product
 the Company will accept those two types of
items back as returns. The amount for these two types of returns
are estimated
 accrued and recognized at the date of sale. These
amounts are included in the determination of net
sales.




Certain retailers require the payment of slotting fees in order to
obtain space for the Company&#x2019;s products on the
retailer&#x2019;s store shelves. The cost of these fees are


recognized at the earlier of the date cash is paid or a liability
to the retailer is created. The amounts are included in the
determination of net sales.




discounts: The amount of sales discounts are estimated
 accrued and
recognized at the date of the sale. These amounts are included in
the determination of net sales.

the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax
liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified
balance sheet. Instead
 organizations will be required to classify
all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The
amendments apply to all organizations that present a classified
balance sheet. For public companies
 the amendments are effective
for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after
December 15
 2016
 and interim periods within those annual periods.
For private companies

 and employee
benefit plans
 the amendments are effective for financial
statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15
2017
 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after
December 15

have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial
position and results of operations.


2015

Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory
&#x201D; which applies to
inventory that is measured using first-in
 first-out
(&#x201C;FIFO&#x201D;) or average cost. Under the updated guidance
an entity should measure inventory that is within scope at the

 2016
and should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted
at the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this
guidance.


FASB issued ASU 2016-02
 Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-01 requires
that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from
operating leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of
financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease
liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use
the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of
12 months or less
 a lessee is permitted to make an accounting
policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease
assets and lease liabilities. In transition
 lessees and lessors
are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of
the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective
approach.

March 10
 2015
 the Company entered into a loan modification
agreement (the &#x201C;Modification Agreement&#x201D;) with its
lender Sterling National Bank (&#x201C;Sterling&#x201D;) which
modified the terms of the financing agreement with Sterling
previously entered into on February 17
 2009 (the &#x201C;Financing
Agreement&#x201D;). Prior to the Modification Agreement
 the
Financing Agreement
 as amended
 provided for a credit facility in
which the Company had a revolving line of credit for a maximum of
$7
000
000 (the &#x201C;Loan Facility&#x201D;). On February 3
 2011
the Company amended the Financing Agreement to create a sublimit
within the revolving line of credit in the form of a $300
000 term
loan for the benefit of GCC. The Financing Agreement was set to
expire on March 31
 2015. Pursuant to the Modification Agreement
the Financing Agreement was modified to
 among other things
 (i)
extend the term of the Financing Agreement until February 28
 2017;
(ii) increase the maximum amount of the Loan Facility from
$7
000
000 to $9
000
000; (iii) reduce the interest rate on the
average unpaid balance of the line of credit from an interest rate
equal to a per annum reference rate of 3.75% to an interest rate
per annum equal to the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate; and (iv)
require the Company to pay
 upon the occurrence of certain
termination events
 a prepayment premium of 0.50% of the maximum
amount of the credit facility in effect as of the date of the
termination event.




than as described above
 the Financing Agreement remains in full
force and effect. Pursuant to the Modification Agreement
 the
Company is able to draw on the loan Facility up to an amount of 85%
of eligible accounts receivable and 25% of eligible inventory
consisting of green coffee beans and finished coffee not to exceed
$1
000
000. The Loan Facility is secured by all tangible and
intangible assets of the Company.




Loan Facility contains covenants that place annual restrictions on
our operations
 including covenants related to debt restrictions
capital expenditures
 minimum deposit restrictions
 tangible net
worth
 net profit
 leverage
 employee loan restrictions
distribution restrictions (common stock and preferred stock)
dividend restrictions
 and restrictive transactions. The Loan
Facility also requires that the Company maintain a minimum working
capital at all times. The Company was in compliance with all
required financial covenants at October 31
 2016 and
2015.




October 31
 2016 and 2015
 the outstanding balance under the bank
line of credit was $5

respectively.



Also on March 10
 2015
 the Company
 as
guarantor
 and OPTCO (the &#x201C;Borrower&#x201D;)
 as borrower
entered into a new loan facility agreement with Sterling. The new
loan facility is a revolving line of credit for a maximum of

Facility terminates on February 28

valuation allowance was not provided at October 31
 2016 or 2015.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets
 management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or
all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation
of future taxable income during the periods in which those
temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the
scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 projected future
taxable income
 and tax planning strategies in making this
assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and
projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the
deferred tax assets are expected to be deductible
 management
believes it is more likely than not the Company will realize the
benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of the
deferred tax asset considered realizable
 however
 could be reduced
in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are
reduced.




October 31
 2016 and 2015
 the Company did not have any
unrecognized tax benefits or open tax positions. The
Company&#x2019;s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties
related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of October
31
 2016 and 2015
 the Company had no accrued interest or penalties
related to income taxes. The Company currently has no federal or
state tax examinations in progress.

risk with respect to other trade receivables is limited due to the

FAIR VALUE
MEASUREMENTS


value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date
 not adjusted for transaction
costs. The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy that
prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair
value into three broad levels giving the highest priority to quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level
1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3) as
described below:




Inputs &#x2013; Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities that are accessible by the
Company;




Inputs &#x2013; Quoted prices in markets that are not active or
financial instruments for which all significant inputs are
observable
 either directly or indirectly; and




Inputs &#x2013; Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability
including significant assumptions of the Company and other market
participants.




Company determines fair values for its investment assets as

plan assets.




Company maintains a deferred compensation plan. The fair value of
the plan assets are classified within Level 1 as the assets are
valued using quoted prices in active markets. The assets are
included with Deposits and other assets in the accompanying balance
sheets. Additional information related to the Company&#x2019;s
deferred compensation plan is disclosed in Note 10.




Company&#x2019;s commodity securities are classified within Level 2
and include coffee futures and options contracts. To determine fair
value
 the Company utilizes the market approach valuation technique
for the coffee futures and options contracts. The Company uses
Level 2 inputs that are based on market data of similar instruments
that are in observable markets. All commodities on the balance
sheet are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value
included in earnings.

Goodwill and trademarks are not amortized but are&#13;assigned to a specific reporting unit or asset class and tested for impairment at least annually or upon the occurrence of an event&#13;or when circumstances indicate that the reporting unit&amp;#8217;s carrying amount of goodwill and trademarks is greater than its fair&#13;value. As of October 31

 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.&#13;The carrying amount of the bank line of credit borrowings approximates fair value because the debt is based on current rates at&#13;which the Company could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time
&#13;based on relevant market information about the financial instruments when available. These estimates are subjective in nature and&#13;involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore

 &amp;#8220;Inventory&#13;(Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory
&amp;#8221; which applies to inventory that is measured using first-in
 first-out&#13;(&amp;#8220;FIFO&amp;#8221;) or average cost. Under the updated guidance
 an entity should measure inventory that is within scope at the&#13;lower of cost and net realizable value
 which is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably&#13;predictable costs of completion

 Leases (Topic 842).&#13;ASU 2016-01 requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases. A lessee should recognize&#13;in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing&#13;its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less
 a lessee is permitted to&#13;make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. In transition

 2016 the Financial Accounting Standards&#13;Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&amp;#8220;ASU&amp;#8221;) 2016-08 that amends the guidance for &lt;i&gt;Principle&#13;versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)&lt;/i&gt; in ASC 2014-09
 &lt;i&gt;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic&#13;606)
&lt;/i&gt; issued in May 2014. The ASU clarifies that the principal or agent determination is based on whether the entity controls&#13;the goods or services before they are transferred to its customer. Public entities must apply ASU 2016-08 to annual reporting periods&#13;beginning after December 15
 2017
 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Nonpublic entities will be&#13;required to adopt the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2018
 and interim periods within annual&#13;reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2019. Earlier application is permitted for both types of entities only as of annual&#13;reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Early adoption&#13;prior to that date is not permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-08 will have on its results of operations

 &lt;i&gt;Revenue&#13;from Contracts with Customers&lt;/i&gt;
 which is a new standard related to revenue recognition. Under the new standard
&#13;recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised services or goods in an amount that reflects the&#13;consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition
 the standard&#13;requires disclosure of the nature
 amount
 timing
 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts.&#13;The standard must be adopted using either a full retrospective approach for all periods presented in the period of adoption&#13;or a modified retrospective approach. In July 2015
 the FASB issued ASU 2015-14
 &lt;i&gt;Revenue from Contracts with Customers -&#13;Deferral of the Effective Date&lt;/i&gt;
 which defers the implementation of this new standard to be effective for fiscal years&#13;beginning after December 15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted effective January 1
 2017. In March 2016
 the FASB issued ASU&#13;2016-08
 &lt;i&gt;Principal versus Agent Considerations&lt;/i&gt;
 which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent&#13;considerations in the new revenue recognition standard pursuant to ASU 2014-09. In April 2016
 the FASB issued ASU 2016-10
 &lt;i&gt;Identifying&#13;Performance Obligations and Licensing&lt;/i&gt;

 2016 and 2015


 2015
 the Company entered into&#13;a loan modification agreement (the &amp;#8220;Modification Agreement&amp;#8221;) with its lender Sterling National Bank (&amp;#8220;Sterling&amp;#8221;)&#13;which modified the terms of the financing agreement with Sterling previously entered into on February 17
 2009 (the &amp;#8220;Financing&#13;Agreement&amp;#8221;). Prior to the Modification Agreement
 the Financing Agreement
 as amended
 provided for a credit facility in&#13;which the Company had a revolving line of credit for a maximum of $7
000
000 (the &amp;#8220;Loan Facility&amp;#8221;). On February 3
&#13;2011
 the Company amended the Financing Agreement to create a sublimit within the revolving line of credit in the form of a $300
000&#13;term loan for the benefit of GCC. The Financing Agreement was set to expire on March 31
 2015. Pursuant to the Modification Agreement
&#13;the Financing Agreement was modified to
 among other things
 (i) extend the term of the Financing Agreement until February 28
&#13;2017; (ii) increase the maximum amount of the Loan Facility from $7
000
000 to $9
000
000; (iii) reduce the interest rate on the&#13;average unpaid balance of the line of credit from an interest rate equal to a per annum reference rate of 3.75% to an interest&#13;rate per annum equal to the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate; and (iv) require the Company to pay
 upon the occurrence of certain&#13;termination events

 the Financing&#13;Agreement remains in full force and effect. Pursuant to the Modification Agreement
 the Company is able to draw on the loan Facility&#13;up to an amount of 85% of eligible accounts receivable and 25% of eligible inventory consisting of green coffee beans and finished&#13;coffee not to exceed $1
000

 including covenants related to debt restrictions
 capital expenditures
 minimum deposit&#13;restrictions
 tangible net worth
 net profit
 leverage
 employee loan restrictions
 distribution restrictions (common stock and&#13;preferred stock)
 dividend restrictions
 and restrictive transactions. The Loan Facility also requires that the Company maintain&#13;a minimum working capital at all times. The Company was in compliance with all required financial covenants at October 31

 2016 and 2015
 the outstanding&#13;balance under the bank line of credit was $5
121
375 and $4
317

 2015
 the Company
 as guarantor
 and OPTCO (the &amp;#8220;Borrower&amp;#8221;)
 as borrower
 entered into a new loan facility&#13;agreement with Sterling. The new loan facility is a revolving line of credit for a maximum of $3
000
000 (the &amp;#8220;New Loan Facility&amp;#8221;).&#13;The New Loan Facility terminates on February 28
 2017.&amp;#160; The Borrower is able to draw on the New Loan Facility at an amount&#13;up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable
 not to exceed 25% of all accounts of the Borrower.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The New Loan Facility&#13;is payable monthly in arrears on the average unpaid balance of the line of credit at an interest rate per annum equal to the Wall&#13;Street Journal Prime Rate&amp;#160;&amp;#160;(currently 3.5%).&amp;#160;The New Loan Facility is secured by all tangible and intangible assets&#13;of the Company. In connection with the New Loan Facility
 the Company entered into a security agreement with Sterling and provided&#13;Sterling with a guarantee of the Borrower&amp;#8217;s obligations.&lt;/font&gt; As of October 31
 2016 and 2015

 2016 or 2015. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets
 management considers whether it is more likely than not&#13;that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent&#13;upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management&#13;considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 projected future taxable income
 and tax planning strategies in making&#13;this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in&#13;which the deferred tax assets are expected to be deductible
 management believes it is more likely than not the Company will realize&#13;the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable
 however

 2016 and 2015
 the Company&#13;did not have any unrecognized tax benefits or open tax positions. The Company&amp;#8217;s practice is to recognize interest and/or&#13;penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of October 31

Goodwill and trademarks are not amortized but are&#13;assigned to a specific reporting unit or asset class and tested for impairment at least annually or upon the occurrence of an event&#13;or when circumstances indicate that the reporting unit&amp;#8217;s carrying amount of goodwill and trademarks is greater than its fair&#13;value. As of October 31
 2016 and 2015
 the Company has determined by using a qualitative assessment that an impairment did not&#13;exist. In 2011
 the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard ASB ASU 2011-08 Intangibles &amp;#8211; Goodwill and Other &amp;#8211;&#13;Testing Goodwill for Impairment
 which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary&#13;to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under this amendment

 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.&#13;The carrying amount of the bank line of credit borrowings approximates fair value because the debt is based on current rates at&#13;which the Company could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time
&#13;based on relevant market information about the financial instruments when available. These estimates are subjective in nature and&#13;involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore

coffees for private labeled accounts and its own brands
 and it sells green coffee.&#160;&#160;The Company also manufactures and
sells coffee roasters. The Company&#8217;s core product
 coffee
 can be summarized and divided into three product categories (&#8220;product
lines&#8221;) as follows:

&#160;&#160;unroasted

 coffee roasted
and blended to the Company&#8217;s own specifications and packaged and sold under the Company&#8217;s eight proprietary and licensed
brand names in different segments of the market.


coffee sales are primarily to customers that are located throughout the United States with limited sales in Canada and certain
countries in Asia.&#160;&#160;Such customers include supermarkets

amount the Company expects to collect. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from
the inability of its customers to make required payments. Management considers the following factors when determining the collectability
of specific customer accounts: customer credit-worthiness
 past transaction history with the customer
 current economic industry
trends
 and changes in customer payment terms. Past due balances over 60 days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually
for collectability. If the financial condition of the Company&#8217;s customers were to deteriorate
 adversely affecting their
ability to make payments
 additional allowances would be required. Based on management&#8217;s assessment
 the Company provides
for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance. Balances that remain outstanding
after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit
to accounts receivable.

and trademarks
 which consist of product lines
 trade names and packaging designs have an indefinite useful life. The value of
the goodwill and trademarks was allocated based on an independent valuation. Goodwill and trademarks are not amortized but are
assigned to a specific reporting unit or asset class and tested for impairment at least annually or upon the occurrence of an event
or when circumstances indicate that the reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount of goodwill and trademarks is greater than its fair
value. As of October 31
 2016 and 2015
 the Company has determined by using a qualitative assessment that an impairment did not
exist. In 2011
 the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard ASB ASU 2011-08 Intangibles &#8211; Goodwill and Other &#8211;
Testing Goodwill for Impairment
 which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary
to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under this amendment
 an entity would not be required to calculate
the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines
 based on a qualitative assessment
 that it is more likely than
not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The amendment includes a number of events and circumstances for an entity
to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment.

deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be computed
for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or
deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected
to affect taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current or non-current based on their
characteristics. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be
realized. The income tax provision or benefit is the tax incurred for the period plus or minus the change during the period in
deferred tax assets and liabilities.

 accounts receivable
notes receivable
 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.
The carrying amount of the bank line of credit borrowings approximates fair value because the debt is based on current rates at
which the Company could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time
based on relevant market information about the financial instruments when available. These estimates are subjective in nature and
involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore
 cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions
could significantly affect the estimates.




with the authoritative guidance. Revenue is recognized at the point title and risk of ownership transfers to its customers upon
the Company&#8217;s shippers taking possession of the goods at the time of shipment because i) title passes in accordance with
the terms of the Company&#8217;s purchase orders and with its agreements with its customers
 ii) any risk of loss is covered by
the Company&#8217;s customers&#8217; insurance
 iii) there is persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement
 iv) the sales price is
determinable and v) collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Thus
 revenue is recognized at the point of shipment
to its customers.

In the event a customer claims receipt of damaged goods
 the Company
 acting as an agent on behalf of the customer
 may file a
claim for reimbursement with the shipper. The Company is not obligated or required to act as an agent on behalf of its customers
but may make the business decision to do so as a convenience to its customers. The shipper keeps the damaged product. The Company
will then ship a completely new order to the customer once a claim has been filed and the Company receives reimbursement or credit
from the shipper for the initial shipment. The Company does evaluate the need
 if any
 of an accrual for returns for damaged goods.
To date
 returns for damaged goods have been immaterial. The Company estimates that
 based on historical trends
 that future returns
for damaged goods should also be immaterial.

The
FASB has issued ASU No. 201517
 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes
 which changes how deferred
taxes are classified on organizations' balance sheets.

The
ASU eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and
noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead
 organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and
liabilities as noncurrent. The amendments apply to all organizations that present a classified balance sheet. For public
companies
 the amendments are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2016
and interim periods within those annual periods. For private companies
 notforprofit organizations
 and employee benefit
plans
 the amendments are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 and
interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15
 2018. The adoption of this standard is not expected to
have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.


 the FASB issued ASU 2015-11
 &#8220;Inventory
(Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory
&#8221; which applies to inventory that is measured using first-in
 first-out
(&#8220;FIFO&#8221;) or average cost. Under the updated guidance
 an entity should measure inventory that is within scope at the
lower of cost and net realizable value
 which is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business
 less reasonably
predictable costs of completion
 disposal and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory that is measured
using last-in
 last-out (&#8220;LIFO&#8221;). This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15
2016
 and should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted at the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.


 Leases (Topic 842).
ASU 2016-01 requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases. A lessee should recognize
in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing
its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less
 a lessee is permitted to
make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. In transition
lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified
retrospective approach.


in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years (i.e.
 January
1
 2019
 for a calendar year entity). Nonpublic business entities should apply the amendments for fiscal years beginning after
December 15
 2019 (i.e.
 January 1
 2020
 for a calendar year entity)
 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after
December 15
 2020. Early application is permitted for all public business entities and all nonpublic business entities upon issuance.

 and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts.

 2016 or 2015. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets
 management considers whether it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management
considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities
 projected future taxable income
 and tax planning strategies in making
this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in
which the deferred tax assets are expected to be deductible
 management believes it is more likely than not the Company will realize
the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable
 however
 could be reduced
in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced.


 2016 and 2015
 the Company
did not have any unrecognized tax benefits or open tax positions. The Company&#8217;s practice is to recognize interest and/or
penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of October 31
 2016 and 2015
 the Company had no accrued interest
or penalties related to income taxes. The Company currently has no federal or state tax examinations in progress.

Approximately 29% of the Company&#8217;s sales
were derived from one customer during the year ended October 31
 2016. This customer also accounted for approximately $3
661
000
or 27% of the Company&#8217;s accounts receivable balance at October 31
 2015. Approximately 54% of the Company&#8217;s sales were
derived from one customer during the year ended October 31
 2015. This customer also accounted for approximately $4
113
000 or
38% of the Company&#8217;s accounts receivable balance at October 31
 2015. Concentration of credit risk with respect to other
trade receivables is limited due to the short payment terms generally extended by the Company
 by ongoing credit evaluations of
customers
 and by maintaining an allowance for doubtful accounts and other allowances that management believes will adequately
provide for credit losses.


 2016
 approximately
43% of the Company&#8217;s purchases were from four vendors. These vendors accounted for approximately $609
000 of the Company&#8217;s
accounts payable at October 31
 2016. For the year ended October 31
 2015
 approximately 64% of the Company&#8217;s purchases were
from five vendors. These vendors accounted for approximately $2
664
000 of the Company&#8217;s accounts payable at October 31
2015. Management does not believe the loss of any one vendor would have a material adverse effect of the Company&#8217;s operations
due to the availability of many alternate suppliers.

Fair value is the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date
not adjusted for transaction costs. The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3) as described below:


in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible by the Company;


markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable
 either directly or
indirectly; and


the asset or liability including significant assumptions of the Company and other market participants.

The assets are included with Deposits and other assets in the accompanying balance sheets. Additional information related to the

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]





The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company
 Organic Products Trading Company
 LLC (&#8220;OPTCO&#8221;)
 Sonofresco LLC (&#8220;Sono&#8221;)
and Generations Coffee Company
 LLC (&#8220;GCC&#8221;). All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.




The preparation of the Company&#8217;s financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;)
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Significant estimates
include allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable and reserves
 inventory obsolescence
 depreciation
 intangible asset valuations
and useful lives
 taxes
 contingencies
 and valuation of financial instruments. These estimates may be adjusted as more current
information becomes available
 and any adjustment could have a significant impact on recorded amounts.




Cash consists primarily of unrestricted cash
on deposit at financial institutions and brokerage firms.




Prepaid coffee is an item that emanates from
OPTCO. The balance represents advance payments made by OPTCO to several coffee growing cooperatives for the purchase of green coffee.
Interest is charged to the cooperatives for these advances. Interest earned was $41
176 and $45
049 as of October 31
 2016 and
2015
 respectively. The prepaid coffee balance was $435
577 and $620
452 as of October 31
 2016 and 2015
 respectively.




Trade accounts receivable are stated at the
amount the Company expects to collect. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from
the inability of its customers to make required payments. Management considers the following factors when determining the collectability
of specific customer accounts: customer credit-worthiness
 past transaction history with the customer
 current economic industry
trends
 and changes in customer payment terms. Past due balances over 60 days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually
for collectability. If the financial condition of the Company&#8217;s customers were to deteriorate
 adversely affecting their
ability to make payments
 additional allowances would be required. Based on management&#8217;s assessment
 the Company provides
for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance. Balances that remain outstanding
after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit
to accounts receivable.


estimated discount that customers will take upon payment. The reserve for other allowances represents the estimated amount of returns
slotting fees and volume based discounts estimated to be incurred by the Company from its customers. The allowances are summarized
as follows:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
(First in
 first out basis) or market
 including provisions for obsolescence commensurate with known or estimated exposures. There
are no reserves for obsolescence as of October 31
 2016 and 2015.




Machinery and equipment are recorded at cost
and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Purchases of machinery and equipment
and additions and betterments which substantially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized at cost. Expenditures which
do not materially prolong the normal useful life of an asset are charged to operations as incurred. The Company also provides for
amortization of leasehold improvements.




The commodities held at broker represent the
market value of the Company&#8217;s trading account
 which consists of option and future contracts for coffee held with a brokerage
firm. The Company uses options and futures contracts
 which are not designated or qualifying as hedging instruments
 to partially
hedge the effects of fluctuations in the price of green coffee beans. Options and futures contracts are recognized at fair value
in the consolidated financial statements with current recognition of gains and losses on such positions. The Company's accounting
for options and futures contracts may increase earnings volatility in any particular period.

 2016
 the Company held 22 futures
contracts (generally with terms of three to four months) for the purchase of 825
000 pounds of green coffee at a weighted average
price of $1.45 per pound. The fair market value of coffee applicable to such contracts was $1.64 per pound at that date. At October

 2016
 the Company did not have any options.


 2015

31
 2015
 the Company held 20 options covering an aggregate of 750
000 pounds of green coffee beans at $1.25 per pound. The fair
market value of these options

The Company has determined that its goodwill
and trademarks
 which consist of product lines
 trade names and packaging designs have an indefinite useful life. The value of
the goodwill and trademarks was allocated based on an independent valuation. Goodwill and trademarks are not amortized but are
assigned to a specific reporting unit or asset class and tested for impairment at least annually or upon the occurrence of an event
or when circumstances indicate that the reporting unit&#8217;s carrying amount of goodwill and trademarks is greater than its fair
value. As of October 31
 2016 and 2015
 the Company has determined by using a qualitative assessment that an impairment did not
exist. In 2011
 the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard ASB ASU 2011-08 Intangibles &#8211; Goodwill and Other &#8211;
Testing Goodwill for Impairment
 which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary
to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under this amendment
 an entity would not be required to calculate
the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines
 based on a qualitative assessment
 that it is more likely than
not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The amendment includes a number of events and circumstances for an entity
to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment.




Customer list and relationships consist of a
specific customer lists and customer contracts obtained by the Company in the acquisition of OPTCO and Sono which are being
amortized on the straight-line method over their estimated useful life of twenty years.




The Company expenses the cost of advertising
and promotion as incurred. Advertising costs charged to operations totaled $170
774 and $157
922 for the years ended October 31
2016 and 2015
 respectively.




income
deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be computed
for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or
deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected
to affect taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current or non-current based on their
characteristics. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be
realized. The income tax provision or benefit is the tax incurred for the period plus or minus the change during the period in
deferred tax assets and liabilities.




Basic earnings per common share were computed
by dividing net income by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share
is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of
common shares issuable upon exercise of potential sources of dilution.


used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share were 6
082
777 and 6
212
929 for the years ended October 31
 2016
and 2015
 respectively.




The carrying amounts of cash
 accounts receivable
notes receivable
 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.
The carrying amount of the bank line of credit borrowings approximates fair value because the debt is based on current rates at
which the Company could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time
based on relevant market information about the financial instruments when available. These estimates are subjective in nature and
involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore
 cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions
could significantly affect the estimates.




The Company recognizes revenue in accordance
with the authoritative guidance. Revenue is recognized at the point title and risk of ownership transfers to its customers upon
the Company&#8217;s shippers taking possession of the goods at the time of shipment because i) title passes in accordance with
the terms of the Company&#8217;s purchase orders and with its agreements with its customers
 ii) any risk of loss is covered by
the Company&#8217;s customers&#8217; insurance
 iii) there is persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement
 iv) the sales price is

Investment in short-term money-market instruments (such as commercial paper
 banker's acceptances
 repurchase agreements
 government securities
 certificates of deposit
 and so forth) which are highly liquid (that is
 readily convertible to known amounts of cash) and so near their maturity that they present an insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally
 only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify as cash equivalents by definition. Original maturity means an original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example
 both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However
 a Treasury note purchased three-years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months.
