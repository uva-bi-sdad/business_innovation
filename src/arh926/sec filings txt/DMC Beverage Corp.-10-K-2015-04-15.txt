 which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.&#160;&#160;The Company has incurred a net loss of $428
900 for the year ended December 31

107
062.&#160;&#160;The Company has a stockholders' deficit of $1
395
575 at December 31
 2014. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate revenues
 its ability to continue to raise investment capital












 the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. &#160;Significant areas of estimate include the impairment of assets and rates for amortization
 accrued liabilities










 2014 and 2013
 respectively
 the Company had $19














 including the disposal of business segments and major lines of business. Long-lived assets are reviewed when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. When necessary
 impaired assets are written down to estimated fair value based on the best information available. Estimated fair value is generally based on either appraised value or measured by discounting estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows. Accordingly
 actual results could vary significantly from such estimates. &#160;The Company did not recognize any impairment losses for the year ended December 31

 Earnings per Share
 which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the statement of operations. &#160;Basic EPS is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. &#160;Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. &#160;In computing diluted EPS
 the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. &#160;Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. &#160;As of December 31

 there were a total of 2

 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-10 Development Stage Entities (Topic 915). The objective of the ASU is to improve financial reporting by reducing the cost and complexity of associated with the incremental reporting requirements for development stage entities. The ASU removes all incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities
 including the inception-to-date information and certain other disclosures. The ASU also eliminates an exception provided to development stage entities in Topic 810 Consolidation for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of amount of investment equity at risk. For public business entities
 those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014
 and interim periods therein. Earlier adoption is permitted for any annual or interim period for which consolidated&#160;financial statements have not yet been issued. Accordingly
 the Company has elected to adopt these changes effective July 17



 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12 Compensation &#8211; Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The ASU provides guidance for accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period. That is the case when an employee is eligible to retire or otherwise terminate employment before the end of the period in which a performance target could be achieved and still be eligible to vest in the award if and when the performance target is achieved. The amendment requires a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that such performance condition would be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered. Those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2015




 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15 Presentation of Financial Statements &#8211; Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40). The ASU provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the consolidated financial statements. The standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The ASU applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15

 including our Chief Executive Officer
 and our Chief Financial Officer
 we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31
 2014
 as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the 
 as amended (the Exchange Act).&#160;&#160;Based on this evaluation
 our Chief Executive and Financial Officer concluded as of December 31
 2014 that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to us required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reports: (i) is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management







 or under the supervision of
 the company's principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company's board of directors
 management and other personnel





































































 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.&#160;Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems
 no matter how well designed
 have inherent limitations. Therefore
 even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.&#160;Because of the inherent limitations of internal control
 there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However
 these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore
 it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce
 though not eliminate








 our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2014 based on the COSO framework criteria




 resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (3) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives affecting authorization
 recordkeeping
 custody of assets
 and reconciliations; (4) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes; and (5) management dominated by two individuals without adequate compensating controls. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive and Financial Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of December 31




 management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures
