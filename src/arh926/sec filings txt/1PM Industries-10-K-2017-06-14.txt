 which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However
 the Company has&nbsp;recurring losses and does not have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern.




 the Company&#8217;s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business
 maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
 and the payment of expenses associated with operations and business developments. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital.


 it has mostly relied upon internally generated funds such as shareholder loans and advances to finance its operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital by retaining net earnings or through future public or private offerings of the Company&#8217;s stock or through loans from private investors

 which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis
 management evaluates its estimates and judgments
 including those related to revenue recognition
 accrued expenses
 financing operations
 and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances
 the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates as to the appropriate carrying value of certain assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources.

 we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies
 which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult
 subjective
 and complex judgments
 often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.

 the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for a similar non-convertible instrument. This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortized cost basis until extinguished upon conversion or at the instrument&#8217;s maturity date.

This is recognized as additional paid-in capital and included in equity

 Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section&nbsp;7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Under this provision
 an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. In other words

 or issuing or offering to issue shares
 options
 and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees
 including grants of employee stock options
 are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award
 known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period).


 

















































 Under this method
 income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year; and
 (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence
 it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.


 a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination
 based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all the relevant information. A liability (including interest and penalties
 if applicable) is established to the extent a current benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain tax position. Related interest and penalties
 if any
 are included as components of income tax expense and income taxes payable.




. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS
 the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.

 fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
 including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable
 market corroborated
 or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement).

 measurement
 presentation
 and disclosure of financial instruments. Effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017
 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Most prominent among the changes in the standard is the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity investments
 with certain exceptions
 to be recognized through net income rather than other comprehensive income (&#8220;OCI&#8221;). We have early adopted this standard
 which resulted in an unrealized gain on marketable securities of $12

 which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However
 the Company has recurring losses
 and does not have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.




 the Company's foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business
 maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
 and the payment of expenses associated with operations and business developments. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital.


 it has mostly relied upon internally generated funds such as shareholder loans and advances to finance its operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital by retaining net earnings or through future public or private offerings of the Company's stock or through loans from private investors
 although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company's failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders.

 management used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission

 which amounts may at times exceed federally&#13;insured limits. We have not experienced any losses on such accounts and we do not believe we are exposed to any significant credit&#13;risk. As of February 28

 &lt;i&gt;&amp;#147;Compensation &amp;#150; Stock Compensation
&amp;#148;&lt;/i&gt; prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based&#13;payment transactions in which employee services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities
 or issuing or offering&#13;to issue shares
 options
 and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based&#13;payments to employees
 including grants of employee stock options
 are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements&#13;based on their fair values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services&#13;in exchange for the award




 &lt;i&gt;&amp;#34;Accounting for&#13;Income Taxes.&amp;#34;&lt;/i&gt; Under this method
 income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable&#13;for the current year; and
 (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized&#13;in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected&#13;to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect&#13;on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that&#13;includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight&#13;of available positive and negative evidence

 a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be&#13;taken may be recognized only if it is &amp;#34;more likely than not&amp;#34; that the position is sustainable upon examination
 based&#13;on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax benefit&#13;that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all&#13;the relevant information. A liability (including interest and penalties
 if applicable) is established to the extent a current&#13;benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain tax position.&#13;Related interest and penalties
 if any

 &amp;#34;&lt;i&gt;Earnings&#13;per Share&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#34;. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income&#13;statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average&#13;number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares&#13;outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In&#13;computing diluted EPS

&#13;terminated or exercised

&amp;#34;&lt;/i&gt; fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or&#13;paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company&#13;utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
 including assumptions&#13;about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable
 market corroborated


 which are either directly or indirectly&#13;observable as of the reported date. Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation&#13;methodologies. These models are primarily industry standard models that consider various assumptions
 including quoted forward&#13;prices for commodities
 time value
 volatility factors
 and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments
&#13;as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout&#13;the full term of the instrument
 can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions&#13;are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity&#13;swaps
 interest rate swaps

 &lt;i&gt;Compensation&amp;#151;Stock Compensation (Topic 718) &amp;#151; Scope&#13;of Modification Accounting.&lt;/i&gt; ASU 2017-09 applies to entities that change the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award.&#13;The FASB adopted ASU 2017-09 to provide clarity and reduce diversity in practice as well as cost and complexity when applying&#13;the guidance in Topic 718
 &lt;i&gt;Compensation&amp;#151;Stock Compensation
&lt;/i&gt; to the modification of the terms and conditions of a share-based&#13;payment award. The amendments provide guidance on determining which changes to the terms and conditions of share-based payment&#13;awards require an entity to apply modification accounting under Topic 718. Effective for all entities for annual periods
 including&#13;interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December 15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted
 including adoption&#13;in any interim period

 &lt;i&gt;Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition&#13;of a Business
&lt;/i&gt; clarifying the definition of a business. The amendments affect all companies and other reporting organizations&#13;that must determine whether they have acquired or sold a business. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting&#13;including acquisitions
 disposals
 goodwill
 and consolidation. The amendments are intended to help companies and other organizations&#13;evaluate whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The amendments provide&#13;a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business. They also provide more consistency&#13;in applying the guidance
 reduce the costs of application
 and make the definition of a business more operable. For public companies
&#13;the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2017

 Measurement
 Presentation

 the FASB issued a new standard related to certain aspects of recognition
 measurement
 presentation
 and disclosure of financial&#13;instruments. Effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017
 including interim periods within&#13;those fiscal years. Most prominent among the changes in the standard is the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity&#13;investments
 with certain exceptions
 to be recognized through net income rather than other comprehensive income (&amp;#147;OCI&amp;#148;).&#13;We have early adopted this standard

 &lt;i&gt;&amp;#147;Compensation &amp;#150; Stock Compensation
&amp;#148;&lt;/i&gt; prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based&#13;payment transactions in which employee services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities
 or issuing or offering&#13;to issue shares
 options
 and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based&#13;payments to employees
 including grants of employee stock options
 are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements&#13;based on their fair values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services&#13;in exchange for the award






 &lt;i&gt;&amp;#34;Accounting for&#13;Income Taxes.&amp;#34;&lt;/i&gt; Under this method
 income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable&#13;for the current year; and
 (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized&#13;in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected&#13;to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect&#13;on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that&#13;includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight&#13;of available positive and negative evidence

 a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken may&#13;be recognized only if it is &amp;#34;more likely than not&amp;#34; that the position is sustainable upon examination
 based on its technical&#13;merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater&#13;than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all the relevant information.&#13;A liability (including interest and penalties
 if applicable) is established to the extent a current benefit has been recognized&#13;on a tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain tax position. Related interest and&#13;penalties
 if any


 &amp;#34;&lt;i&gt;Earnings&#13;per Share&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#34;. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income&#13;statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average&#13;number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares&#13;outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In&#13;computing diluted EPS


 terminated or exercised


&amp;#34;&lt;/i&gt; fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset&#13;or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The&#13;Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
 including assumptions&#13;about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable
 market corroborated


 which are either directly or indirectly&#13;observable as of the reported date. Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation&#13;methodologies. These models are primarily industry standard models that consider various assumptions
 including quoted forward&#13;prices for commodities
 time value
 volatility factors
 and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments
&#13;as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout&#13;the full term of the instrument
 can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions&#13;are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity&#13;swaps
 interest rate swaps

 &lt;i&gt;Compensation&amp;#151;Stock Compensation (Topic 718) &amp;#151; Scope&#13;of Modification Accounting.&lt;/i&gt; ASU 2017-09 applies to entities that change the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award.&#13;The FASB adopted ASU 2017-09 to provide clarity and reduce diversity in practice as well as cost and complexity when applying&#13;the guidance in Topic 718
 &lt;i&gt;Compensation&amp;#151;Stock Compensation
&lt;/i&gt; to the modification of the terms and conditions of a&#13;share-based payment award. The amendments provide guidance on determining which changes to the terms and conditions of share-based&#13;payment awards require an entity to apply modification accounting under Topic 718. Effective for all entities for annual periods
&#13;including interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December 15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted
 including&#13;adoption in any interim period

 &lt;i&gt;Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition&#13;of a Business
&lt;/i&gt; clarifying the definition of a business. The amendments affect all companies and other reporting organizations&#13;that must determine whether they have acquired or sold a business. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting&#13;including acquisitions
 disposals
 goodwill
 and consolidation. The amendments are intended to help companies and other organizations&#13;evaluate whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The amendments provide&#13;a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business. They also provide more consistency&#13;in applying the guidance
 reduce the costs of application
 and make the definition of a business more operable. For public companies
&#13;the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2017

 Measurement
 Presentation

 the FASB issued a new standard related to certain aspects of recognition
 measurement
 presentation
 and disclosure of financial&#13;instruments. Effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017
 including interim periods within&#13;those fiscal years. Most prominent among the changes in the standard is the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity&#13;investments
 with certain exceptions
 to be recognized through net income rather than other comprehensive income (&amp;#147;OCI&amp;#148;).&#13;We have early adopted this standard
 which resulted in an unrealized gain on marketable securities of $12

 2017








Basis
of Presentation

The
Financial Statements and related disclosures have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. The Financial
Statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(&#147;GAAP&#148;) of the United States.

Principles
of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of 1PM Industries
 Inc. and its subsidiary. Intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated.

Estimates
and Assumptions

The
Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (&#147;GAAP&#148;) which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

We
consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The
carrying value of those investments approximates their fair market value due to their short maturity and liquidity. Cash and cash
equivalents include cash on hand and amounts on deposit with financial institutions
 which amounts may at times exceed federally
insured limits. We have not experienced any losses on such accounts and we do not believe we are exposed to any significant credit
risk. As of February 28
 2017 and February 29
 2016
 we had cash and cash equivalents of $360
941 and $9
200
 respectively. Of
the cash and cash equivalents held at February 29
 2017
 $213
197 were funds held in a money market fund.

Advertising
and Marketing Costs

Advertising
and marketing costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling
 general and administrative expenses.

Marketable
Securities 

The
Company&#146;s marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale
securities.&#160;&#160;Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates
the designations at each balance sheet date.&#160;&#160;We classify our marketable equity securities as either short-term or
long-term based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations.&#160;We adopted ASC
825-10-50
&#160;Our marketable
equity securities are carried at fair value
 with the unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of earnings.
Adjustments resulting from the change in fair value
 included in earnings
 were an unrealized gain of $12
196
847 and $0 for
the years ending February 28
 2017 and February 29
 2016
 respectively.

Share-Based
Compensation

ASC
718

&#148;
payment transactions in which employee services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities
 or issuing or offering
to issue shares
 options
 and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based
payments to employees
 including grants of employee stock options
 are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements
based on their fair values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services
in exchange for the award
 known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period).

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC
505-50
 Measurement of share-based payment transactions with
non-employees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received; or (b)
the equity instruments issued. The fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance
commitment date or performance completion date.

Revenue
Recognition

The
Company recognizes revenue from the services in accordance with ASC 605
 The Company recognizes
revenue only when all of the following criteria have been met:



    
    
Persuasive
    evidence for an agreement exists;

    
    
Service
    has been provided;

    
    
The
    fee is fixed or determinable; and


    
    
Collection
    is reasonably assured.


Income
Taxes

The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740

Income Taxes.&#34;
 income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable
for the current year; and
 (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized
in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that
includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight
of available positive and negative evidence
 it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized.

ASC
740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of a tax position taken
or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10
 a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be
taken may be recognized only if it is &#34;more likely than not&#34; that the position is sustainable upon examination
 based
on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax benefit
that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all
the relevant information. A liability (including interest and penalties
 if applicable) is established to the extent a current
benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain tax position.
Related interest and penalties
 if any
 are included as components of income tax expense and income taxes payable.

Earnings
(Loss) Per Share

The
Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#34;ASC&#34;) 260

per Share
statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average
number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares
outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In
computing diluted EPS
 the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased
from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.

Derivative
financial instruments

Derivative
financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently remeasured to fair value
at each reporting date. The Company designates certain derivatives as hedges of the change of fair value of recognized assets
and liabilities (&#147;fair value hedges&#148;). Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold
terminated or exercised
 no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or the Company chooses to end the hedging relationship.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

As

&#34;
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company
utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
 including assumptions
about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable
 market corroborated
or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. ASC 820 establishes
a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs (level 3 measurement).

The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined by ASC 820 are as follows:

Level
1 &#150; Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets
are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information
on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives
 marketable securities
and listed equities.

Level
2 &#150; Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly
observable as of the reported date. Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation
methodologies. These models are primarily industry standard models that consider various assumptions
 including quoted forward
prices for commodities
 time value
 volatility factors
 and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments
as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout
the full term of the instrument
 can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions
are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity
swaps
 interest rate swaps
 options and collars.

Level
3 &#150; Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may
be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management's best estimate of fair value.

The
following table summarizes fair value measurements by level at February 28
 2017 and February 29
 2016
 measured at fair value
on a recurring basis:

 2017
 including interim periods within
those fiscal years. Most prominent among the changes in the standard is the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity
investments
 with certain exceptions
 to be recognized through net income rather than other comprehensive income (&#147;OCI&#148;).
We have early adopted this standard
 which resulted in an unrealized gain on marketable securities of $12

Feb. 28
 2017







The
Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable
to a going concern
 which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
However
 the Company has recurring losses
 and does not have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating
costs. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described
in the preceding paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any
adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

In
the coming year
 the Company's foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business
maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
 and the payment of
expenses associated with operations and business developments. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to
raise additional capital.

Historically
it has mostly relied upon internally generated funds such as shareholder loans and advances to finance its operations and growth.
Management may raise additional capital by retaining net earnings or through future public or private offerings of the Company's
stock or through loans from private investors
 although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing.
The Company's failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders.



































The entire disclosure when substantial doubt is raised about the ability to continue as a going concern. Includes
 but is not limited to
 principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern

Promissory
Note &#150; December 10
 2015

On
December 10
 2015
 the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Company issued a convertible
note in the amount of $170
000
 which included an original issue discount (&#34;OID&#34;) of $20
000
 for net proceeds to be
provided of $150
000. Pursuant to the terms of the note
 net proceeds of $45
000 upon closure of the agreement
 on which the Company
recognized a pro-rated OID of $15
000 in addition to the cash proceeds and two investor notes for $50
000 each. The debt is convertible
upon effective date of the note
 debt holder can convert into common stock at $0.30 per share unless market capitalization falls
below $10M at any time in which the conversion rate is reset to lower of conversion price and market price with a true-up provision.
In addition to the convertible note
 the Company granted to the same investor the right to purchase
 at any time
 three five&#8722;year
100
000 fully paid and non-assessable cashless warrants of Company's common stock. The exercise price of the cashless warrants
are $0.30 unless
 while warrant is outstanding
 the Company sells any common stock
 debt
 warrants
 options
 preferred shares
or other instruments or securities which are convertible into or exercisable for shares of common stock
 at an effective price
per share less than the exercise price then such price shall become the exercise price.

During
year ended February 28
 2017
 the Company issued a convertible note of $110
000 with 183
334 warrants according to the Securities
Purchase Agreement on December 10
 2015 and the Company received cash of $90
000 and recognized pro-rated OID of $20
000.

The
Company identified conversion features embedded within convertible debt and warrants issued during 2016 and 2015. The Company
has determined that the conversion feature of the Notes represents an embedded derivative since the Notes include a reset provision
which could cause adjustments upon conversion. Accordingly
 the Notes are not considered to be conventional debt and the embedded
conversion feature must be bifurcated from the debt host and accounted for as a derivative liability. The warrants are exercisable
into 283
334 shares of common stock
 for a period of five years from issuance
 at a price of $0.30 per share. On December 16
2016
 the Company issued another convertible note to third party
 as a result of the reset features the warrants became exercisable
into 850
002 shares of common stock at $0.0.0059 per share. The reset feature of warrants associated with this convertible note
was effective at the time that a separate convertible note with lower exercise price was issued. Per the terms of the warrants
once this separate convertible note was issued the reset feature was effective. The reset provision calls for the increase in
warrants not to exceed a number equal to 3 times the number of warrant shares issuance under this warrant as of the issue date

The
Company determined that the conversion feature met the definition of a liability in accordance with ASC Topic No. 815 - 40
 Derivatives
and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Stock and therefore bifurcated the embedded conversion option once the note becomes convertible
and accounted for it as a derivative liability. The fair value of the conversion feature was recorded as a debt discount and amortized
to interest expense over the term of the note.

The
Company valued the conversion feature using the Black Scholes valuation model. The fair value of the derivative liability for
all the note and warrants that became convertible during the year ended February 28
 2017 amounted to $113
578. $90
000 of the
value assigned to the derivative liability was recognized as a debt discount to the notes while the balance of $23
578 was recognized
as a &#147;day 1&#148; derivative loss.

During
the year ended February 28
 2017
 the Company recognized a principal adjustment of $81
588 based on the default penalties and
true-up provisions and was recognized as interest expense.

During
the year ended February 28
 2017
 the Company repaid notes with principal amounts and accrued interest totaling to $21
442 and
converted notes with principal amounts and accrued interest of $176
707 into 53
289
257 shares of common stock. The corresponding
derivative liability at the date of conversion of $453
079 was credited to additional paid in capital.

Promissory
Notes - Issued in fiscal year 2017

During
the year ended February 28
 2017
 the Company issued a total of $227
500 notes with the following terms:



    
    
Terms
    ranging from 9 months to 2 years.

    
    
    

    
    
Annual
    interest rates of 10% - 12%.

    
    
    

    
    
Convertible
    at the option of the holders either at issuance or 180 days from issuance. The note dated June 6
 2016 is convertible at September
    6
 2016.

    
    
    

    
    
Conversion
    prices are typically based on the discounted (35% to 60% discount) lowest trading prices of the Company&#146;s shares during
    various periods prior to conversion. Certain notes allow for the conversion price to be the lower of the closing sale price
    or the discounted trading price.


Certain
notes allow the Company to redeem the notes at rates ranging from 125% to 150% depending on the redemption date provided that
no redemption is allowed after the 180th day. Likewise
 certain notes include original issue discounts totaling to $34
600 and
the Company received cash of $192
900.

The
Company identified conversion features embedded within certain notes and warrants issued during 2017. The Company has determined
that the conversion feature of the Notes represents an embedded derivative since the Notes include a reset provision which could
cause adjustments upon conversion. Accordingly
 the Notes are not considered to be conventional debt and the embedded conversion
feature must be bifurcated from the debt host and accounted for as a derivative liability. The warrants are exercisable into 1
875
000
and 10
181
704 shares of common stock
 for a period of five years from issuance
 at a price of $0.10 and $0.0059 per share
 respectively.
We accounted for the issuance of the Warrants as a derivative. On December 16
 2016
 the Company issued another convertible note
to third party
 as a result of the reset features the warrants became exercisable into 31
779
661 shares of common stock at $0.0059
per share.

The
Company determined that the conversion feature met the definition of a liability in accordance with ASC Topic No. 815 - 40
 Derivatives
and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Stock and therefore bifurcated the embedded conversion option once the note becomes convertible
and accounted for it as a derivative liability. The fair value of the conversion feature was recorded as a debt discount and amortized
to interest expense over the term of the note.

The
Company valued the conversion feature using the Black Scholes valuation model. The fair value of the derivative liability for
all the note and warrants that became convertible during year ended February 28
 2017 amounted to $516
751. $192
900 of the value
assigned to the derivative liability was recognized as a debt discount to the notes while the balance of $323
851 was recognized
as a &#147;day 1&#148; derivative loss.

During
the year ended February 28
 2017
 the Company converted notes with principal amounts and accrued interest of $102
422 into 86
934
008
shares of common stock. The corresponding derivative liability at the date of conversion of $230
485 was credited to additional
paid in capital.

The
Company analyzed the conversion option for derivative accounting consideration under ASC 815
 Derivatives and Hedging
 and hedging
and determined that the instrument should be classified as a liability since the conversion option becomes effective at issuance
resulting in there being no explicit limit to the number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of the above conversion options.

ASC
815 requires we assess the fair market value of derivative liability at the end of each reporting period and recognize any change
in the fair market value as other income or expense item.

The
Company determined our derivative liabilities to be a Level 3 fair value measurement and used the Black-Scholes pricing model
to calculate the fair value as of February 28
 2017. The Black-Scholes model requires six basic data inputs: the exercise or strike
price
 time to expiration
 the risk-free interest rate
 the current stock price
 the estimated volatility of the stock price in
the future
 and the dividend rate. Changes to these inputs could produce a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.
The fair value of each convertible note is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The following weighted-average assumptions
were used in the February 28
 2017 and February 29
 2016 valuations:

We
did not provide any current or deferred U.S. federal income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because
we have experienced operating losses since inception. When it is more likely than not that a tax asset cannot be realized through
future income the Company must allow for this future tax benefit. We provided a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax
asset
 consisting of net operating loss carry forwards
 because management has determined that it is more likely than not that
we will not earn income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets during the carry forward period.

The
Company has not taken a tax position that
 if challenged
 would have a material effect on the financial statements for the years
ended February 2017 applicable under FASB ASC 740. We did not recognize any adjustment to the liability for uncertain tax position
and therefore did not record any adjustment to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit on the balance sheet. All tax returns
for the Company remain open.

The
provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before
provision for income taxes. The sources and tax effects of the differences for the periods presented are as follows:

The Financial
Statements and related disclosures have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. The Financial Statements
have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;)
of the United States.




The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of 1PM Industries
 Inc. and its subsidiary. Intercompany transactions and balances have
been eliminated.




The Company
prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(&#147;GAAP&#148;) which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.




We consider
all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying
value of those investments approximates their fair market value due to their short maturity and liquidity. Cash and cash equivalents
include cash on hand and amounts on deposit with financial institutions
 which amounts may at times exceed federally insured limits.
We have not experienced any losses on such accounts and we do not believe we are exposed to any significant credit risk. As of
February 28
 2017 and February 29
 2016
 we had cash and cash equivalents of $360
941 and $9
200
 respectively. Of the cash and
cash equivalents held at February 29
 2017
 $213
197 were funds held in a money market fund.

marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale securities.&#160;&#160;Management determines
the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the designations at each balance

each security and its availability for use in current operations.&#160;We adopted ASC 825-10-50

ASC

&#148;
payment transactions in which employee services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities
 or issuing or offering
to issue shares
 options
 and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based
payments to employees
 including grants of employee stock options
 are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements
based on their fair values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services
in exchange for the award
 known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period).

The Company
accounts for stock-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50
 Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees
is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments
issued. The fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance
completion date.




The
Company recognizes revenue from the services in accordance with ASC 605
 The Company
recognizes revenue only when all of the following criteria have been met:



    
    
Persuasive
    evidence for an agreement exists;

    
    
Service
    has been provided;

    
    
The
    fee is fixed or determinable; and


    
    
Collection
    is reasonably assured.





The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740

Income Taxes.&#34;
 income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable
for the current year; and
 (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized
in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that
includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if
 based on the weight
of available positive and negative evidence
 it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized.

ASC 740 prescribes
a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of a tax position taken or expected
to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10
 a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken may
be recognized only if it is &#34;more likely than not&#34; that the position is sustainable upon examination
 based on its technical
merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater
than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all the relevant information.
A liability (including interest and penalties
 if applicable) is established to the extent a current benefit has been recognized
on a tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain tax position. Related interest and
penalties
 if any
 are included as components of income tax expense and income taxes payable.




The Company
computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#34;ASC&#34;) 260

per Share
statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average
number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares
outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In
computing diluted EPS
 the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased
from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.




Derivative
financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently remeasured to fair value
at each reporting date. The Company designates certain derivatives as hedges of the change of fair value of recognized assets
and liabilities (&#147;fair value hedges&#148;). Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is
sold
 terminated or exercised
 no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or the Company chooses to end the hedging relationship.




As

&#34;
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The
Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
 including assumptions
about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable
 market corroborated
or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. ASC 820 establishes
a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs (level 3 measurement).

The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined by ASC 820 are as follows:

Level
1 &#150; Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets
are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information
on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives
 marketable securities
and listed equities.

Level
2 &#150; Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1
 which are either directly or indirectly
observable as of the reported date. Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation
methodologies. These models are primarily industry standard models that consider various assumptions
 including quoted forward
prices for commodities
 time value
 volatility factors
 and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments
as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout
the full term of the instrument
 can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions
are executed in the marketplace. Instruments in this category generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity
swaps
 interest rate swaps
 options and collars.

Level
3 &#150; Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may
be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management's best estimate of fair value.

following table summarizes fair value measurements by level at February 28
 2017 and February 29

Recent
Accounting Policies Not Yet Adopted

The
FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2017-09

of Modification Accounting.
The FASB adopted ASU 2017-09 to provide clarity and reduce diversity in practice as well as cost and complexity when applying
the guidance in Topic 718


share-based payment award. The amendments provide guidance on determining which changes to the terms and conditions of share-based
payment awards require an entity to apply modification accounting under Topic 718. Effective for all entities for annual periods
including interim periods within those annual periods
 beginning after December 15
 2017. Early adoption is permitted
 including
adoption in any interim period
 for public business entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet
been issued. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2017-09 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements.

The
FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2017-01

of a Business

that must determine whether they have acquired or sold a business. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting
including acquisitions
 disposals
 goodwill
 and consolidation. The amendments are intended to help companies and other organizations
evaluate whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The amendments provide
a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business. They also provide more consistency
in applying the guidance
 reduce the costs of application
 and make the definition of a business more operable. For public companies
the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15
 2017
 including interim periods within those periods.
The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2017-01 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Recent
Accounting Policies Adopted

Financial
Instruments &#150; Recognition
 Measurement
 Presentation
 and Disclosure

In January
2016
 the FASB issued a new standard related to certain aspects of recognition
 measurement
 presentation
 and disclosure of financial
instruments. Effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017
 including interim periods within
those fiscal years. Most prominent among the changes in the standard is the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity
investments
 with certain exceptions
 to be recognized through net income rather than other comprehensive income (&#147;OCI&#148;).
We have early adopted this standard
 which resulted in an unrealized gain on marketable securities of $12
196
847
 being recognized
in net income.



























































































Disclosure of accounting policy for basis of accounting
 or basis of presentation
 used to prepare the financial statements (for example
 US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
 Other Comprehensive Basis of Accounting
 IFRS).




























Disclosure of accounting policy for cash and cash equivalents
 including the policy for determining which items are treated as cash equivalents. Other information that may be disclosed includes (1) the nature of any restrictions on the entity's use of its cash and cash equivalents
 (2) whether the entity's cash and cash equivalents are insured or expose the entity to credit risk
 (3) the classification of any negative balance accounts (overdrafts)
 and (4) the carrying basis of cash equivalents (for example
 at cost) and whether the carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value.




























Disclosure of accounting policy regarding (1) the principles it follows in consolidating or combining the separate financial statements
 including the principles followed in determining the inclusion or exclusion of subsidiaries or other entities in the consolidated or combined financial statements and (2) its treatment of interests (for example
 common stock
 a partnership interest or other means of exerting influence) in other entities
 for example consolidation or use of the equity or cost methods of accounting.  The accounting policy may also address the accounting treatment for intercompany accounts and transactions
 noncontrolling interest
 and the income statement treatment in consolidation for issuances of stock by a subsidiary.




























Disclosure of accounting policy for computing basic and diluted earnings or loss per share for each class of common stock and participating security. Addresses all significant policy factors
 including any antidilutive items that have been excluded from the computation and takes into account stock dividends
 splits and reverse splits that occur after the balance sheet date of the latest reporting period but before the issuance of the financial statements.




























Disclosure of accounting policy for fair value measurements of financial and non-financial assets
 liabilities and instruments classified in shareholders' equity. Disclosures include
 but are not limited to
 how an entity that manages a group of financial assets and liabilities on the basis of its net exposure measures the fair value of those assets and liabilities.




























Disclosure of accounting policy for income taxes
 which may include its accounting policies for recognizing and measuring deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowances
 recognizing investment tax credits
 operating loss carryforwards
 tax credit carryforwards
 and other carryforwards
 methodologies for determining its effective income tax rate and the characterization of interest and penalties in the financial statements.




























Disclosure of accounting policy for investments in debt and equity securities that have readily determinable fair values (marketable securities). At a minimum
 the disclosure might address accounting policies for investments classified as trading
 available for sale
 or held to maturity and may include how the entity determines whether impairments of available for sale or held to maturity investments are other than temporary
 how the fair values of the entity's securities are determined
 and the entity's accounting treatment for transfers between investment categories.




























Disclosure of accounting policy pertaining to new accounting pronouncements that may impact the entity's financial reporting. Includes
 but is not limited to
 quantification of the expected or actual impact.




























Disclosure of accounting policy for revenue recognition. If the entity has different policies for different types of revenue transactions
 the policy for each material type of transaction is generally disclosed. If a sales transaction has multiple element arrangements (for example
 delivery of multiple products
 services or the rights to use assets) the disclosure may indicate the accounting policy for each unit of accounting as well as how units of accounting are determined and valued. The disclosure may encompass important judgment as to appropriateness of principles related to recognition of revenue. The disclosure also may indicate the entity's treatment of any unearned or deferred revenue that arises from the transaction.




























Disclosure of accounting policy for stock option and stock incentive plans. This disclosure may include (1) the types of stock option or incentive plans sponsored by the entity (2) the groups that participate in (or are covered by) each plan (3) significant plan provisions and (4) how stock compensation is measured
 and the methodologies and significant assumptions used to determine that measurement.
