of revenue
 the Company expects to derive additional revenue from biofuels production subsidies. The European Union (&ldquo;EU&rdquo;)
recognizes that producing Biofuel food crops on crop land has considerable cost implications since they are staple foods and need
significant subsidies to be converted to biofuels. The price and demand for fuel has contributed to escalating food price inflation
over recent years causing serious hardship for poorer populations. The EU is expected to implement a major overhaul of biofuels
production subsidies that favor the Company.

 the use of the food grains in the production of ethanol along
with the cost for fuel is causing widespread increases in food prices and governments are now seeking alternative feedstock and

 cost for feedstock. Company&rsquo;s robust returns
are a result of the low cost of its feedstock
 which in fact is not a cost (liability) but a source of revenue (asset)
 since
Malta pays a tipping fee to get rid of its MSW. The use of MSW and other waste feedstock ensures economically viable operations

expectations to be derived from these practices. In order to be successful
 it is necessary to build a facility that is more efficient
and more effective than previous technologies employed by others. To accomplish this with minimal risk
 certain protocols have
been established by the Company&rsquo;s engineers to insure that the plant to be designed and built will meet all requisite standards
discussed throughout the body of this plan. The Company&rsquo;s engineers believe these extrapolations are limited

Drivers Promoting Processing MSW to
Ethanol



    
    
Need
    for a clean
 non-polluting process for the manufacture of fuel grade Ethanol

    
    
The absolute amount
    of waste produced is rising

    
    
Unchecked emission
    of greenhouse gases may lead to a rise in global temperature

    
    
In less developed
    countries
 waste production per capita is rising
 probably at an even faster rate than the EU
 as per-capita GNP and living
    standards increase

    
    
Developed countries
    are banning/limiting landfill and dumping of waste leading to an increased demand for waste processing and waste mitigation

    
    
Less developed countries
    have acknowledged the need for waste management

    
    
Release of toxic
    materials into water and air is prohibited in many countries

    
    
More countries are
    banning or limiting landfill and dumping of waste to protect the environment

    
    
Governments are
    increasingly enacting environmental taxation

    
    
Recycling of materials
    is fundamental in modern waste treatment and disposal

    
    
Oil
 electricity
    and other energy prices are all rising

    
    
Population is rising
    and land is getting increasingly expensive
 particularly land used for growing feedstock for fuel

    
    
Transportation costs
    are increasing - reflecting rising oil
 land and labor prices

    
    
Increasing demand
    for waste treatment in urban areas
 coupled with ongoing health concerns requires innovative application of proven technologies/methods
    to treat waste economically

    
    
The cost of food
    grain is rising due to their diversion to Biofuel production thus causing higher food prices and starvation

    
    
Liquid energy in the form of Ethanol may have
    higher market value than other forms of energy conversion

Hydrolysis to convert celluloses to saccharides was discovered in the 1820&rsquo;s and used by Henry Ford in the 1920-30&rsquo;s
to provide the feed stock for producing fuel grade Ethanol.


of converting celluloses to high value saccharides
 and thus increases the resulting yield of Ethanol from Biomass and waste materials.


process by using a shallow commercial water well chamber modified to be a sealed vacuum chamber in which hangs the GPV. After
receipt and initial shredding of cellulosic materials
 the Biomass is mixed with water and impregnated with a mild alkali solution.
The processed Biomass then enters the outer annulus of the GPV passing downwards
 pre-heating and accumulating pressure. In the
reaction chamber at the bottom of the GPV
 Oxygen is used to destroy tramp organics that inhibit fermentation followed by the
introduction of a catalyst (dilute carbonic acid) to instigate the disassociation of the celluloses to saccharides (sugars). This
oxidation step is exothermic and after pre-heating
 Celsius). With a
small portion of un-reacted nitrogen and thermal expansion
 the density of the mixture is lowered to allow natural convection
to move the fluids through the GPV without pumping. The mixture
 which is now sugar based
 rises up the inner pipe after neutralization
of its acid in the reaction chambers. The mixture continues to rise driven upwards past the downward flowing colder feed mix
and as it does
 it allows its heat to pass through the wall of the inner heat exchanging pipe to the descending raw materials
in the outer annulus of the GPV. At the surface the sugar mixture is then cleaned using conventional water processing equipment
and forwarded for conversion to Ethanol or Biofuel ready for sale. All tanks and processing vessels are enclosed. The system is
completely sealed to prevent loss of product
 odors and environmental contamination. Ethanol produced from Biomass waste eliminates
the production of new Green House Gases (GHG) arising from the waste. Ethanol is used up to an 85% concentration as a substitute
for the refined fossil fuels as an additive to gasoline. It offers a further reduction in the emission of GHG giving additional
benefits to the environment. The GHG emissions of landfill gasses are also dramatically reduced.



    
    






from cellulosic material uses a combination of higher temperatures with acid conditions. The higher the temperature
 the lesser
the amount of acid needed. This hydrolysis reaction process is nearly instantaneous and must be arrested before the acids decompose
the saccharides created from de-polymerization of the cellulosic materials. In the case of the GPV the acidic conditions are neutralized
to arrest the reaction and the heat energy is recovered.


advantage made available by using a continuous plug flow GPV reaction chamber
 combined with the advantages of no moving parts
a tolerance for large size pieces and use of many types of raw materials
 the internal recycling of pressure and heat energy all
combine to create high availability.

Gravity Pressure Vessel &copy; (GPV)
Visual



Recap of the Gravity Pressure Vessel
and How It Works



    
    
The
    GPV hangs freely in a 700 meter deep shaft

    
    
The containment
    shaft consists of a steel tube fixed in a grout jacket

    
    
The shaft is brought
    under vacuum pressure
 like a vacuum flask

    
    
The GPV is a closed
    outer tube with an open inner tube

    
    
Celluloses waste
    in water is pumped through the outer pipe down and through the inner pipe up




    
    





    
    
At the
    bottom of the pipe
 celluloses converts to sugars in a low pH environment

    
    
The acid is neutralized
    with alkaline to retain the sugars

    
    
The up going stream
    heats the down going stream

    
    
It is an energy
    efficient sterile chemical flow process without moving parts and gas emissions

    
    
After the celluloses
    are cracked in the &ldquo;reactor&rdquo; chamber
 the sugar dissolves and rises through the inner pipe to the closed sedimentation
    tanks on ground level

    
    
Here the remaining
    inorganic dense and lightweight particles are removed for beneficial reuse.

    
    
The Saccharides
    are then stripped of other valuable organic byproducts and passed forward for fermentation to ethanol

is about to start. However
 as soon as the financing is in place and mobilization of the designers and construction companies has
occurred
 this process will be started. This whole procedure will be nurtured through a VM/VE (Value Management/Value Engineering)
audit trail which will be under constant review by the in-house staff and consultants for the Company.


and the residual planning assays with MEPA (Malta Environment and Planning Authority) need to be finalized before the actual construction
begins. These investigations may be carried out simultaneously with the need to assess and confirm the supply of the raw materials
used to make the Biofuels
 and should be confirmed by the necessary laboratory testing which will be carried out in the local testing
centers and University. At the same time
 pre-orders should be lodged with the longest lead time items including that for the drilling
company that will be needed to drill the bore-holes for the installation of the three gravity pressure vessels. All boreholes should
be drilled to the common depth of 610 meters (2000 feet) needed for the process. The drilling of these boreholes and the installation
of the steel-work will take approximately six (6) weeks. Two major drilling companies have been asked for quotes for this part
of the operation and early indications suggest that one will be the most acceptable in terms of practice
 record and price for
this part of the work. Again
 the lead time to obtain the fermentation and concentration plant for the production of the Ethanol
will also be required to be ordered early on and this should be organized at the same time.

amount and specifications of the fuel prior to its release and collection by Company&rsquo;s own transportation fleet of HGV Class
III articulated tankers to ship the fuel to the storage depot in the Malta Free Port for export. Within the Malta Free Port an
additional storage tank for the Ethanol can be built to accommodate this need.


 the Malta Biomass to Ethanol
Facility should take around 22 months to construct but because of the phased nature of construction and commissioning it will
start delivering Ethanol well within this period &ndash; at around 12 to 15 months. It is anticipated that upon establishment
of the full operating protocols the facility may become fully operational within 22 months of commissioning.




 the Company is in discussions
with the following contractors:





    
    
David
    Xuereb &amp; Associates is anticipated to be the local firm of Architects and Engineers. The Maltese authorities approved
    the employment of David Xuereb &amp; Associates at an early stage in negotiations and the firm will be the single point of
    contact for the full design and all attendant issues of the facility. The design role should include the direct design input
    from GeneSyst as part of the licensing arrangements with GeneSyst.




    
    
Kevin
    H Ramsey Consulting may provide additional design work relating to the Civil and Process Engineering
 which includes Chemical
    Hydraulics
 Thermodynamics etc. with Mechanical and Electrical
 HV/LV and Power
 and ICA/SCADA works.




    
    
The
    Malta College of Arts Science and Technology and the University of Malta
 together with Queen's University in Belfast and
    the Carbolea Institute at the University of Limerick may also be providing services to assist in verifying the input materials
    through testing and analytical work.

from different sources of Biomass ranges from 132 liters of Ethanol per metric ton
 to over 340liters per metric ton from raw
materials rich in fiber such as wood
 low lignin pulp and sugar beet residues. It is estimated
 over 40 different kinds of fiber
sources may be available from population centers
 many associated with negative cost sourcing
 all of which are usable in GPV
processing. Negative cost sourcing refers to buyer cost factors. Buyer cost factors are response adjustments that occur when dealing
with a particular supplier. Buyer cost factors account for negative (and positive) aspects inherent in dealing with a particular
supplier. Such aspects could include the risk involved in dealing with a particular supplier because of supplier location
 or
possible supplier past performance. For example
 a new and untried supplier (or new manufacturing or shipping location for an
incumbent supplier) exposes the buying organization to a higher risk of supply disruption simply because the buying organization
has no experience of buying from the new supplier or location. Buyer cost factors are used in transformational bidding/quoting.

The generic family of processing materials
 known as the &ldquo;pump and tank&rdquo; mechanical means of inducing higher temperatures
in fluids via pumping and heat exchangers includes: wet oxidation (Zimproet. Al.) pyrolysis
 acid hydrolysis (both concentrated
and dilute). All have in common the use of heat to crack
 decompose or make digestible complex organic debris &ndash; basically
similar to cooking foods for the same reasons. The most common practitioner of these arts was the Zimpro process which built over
200 commercial plants between 1960 and 1990. Of these only 5 are still in operation by virtue of cannibalization of parts from
other units. Again
 the problems revolve around &ldquo;on line availability
&rdquo; mechanical complexity

challenges and low yields. Attempts at strong acid hydrolysis in lieu of wet oxidation had the added complication of acid destruction
of containment vessels. Yields in all cases were low due to the time period to manipulate the combination of the cellulose to
sugar reaction (the combination of higher temperatures and acidic conditions) and complex mixtures of thick cellulosic semi-solid
pastes obligated by the costs of pumping and containment. The longer the reaction
 the more sugars were destroyed before extraction.

Rather
than solve the problems of acid hydrolysis researchers moved to the more academic fields of enzyme enhancements which to date
have turned out to require the use of expendable proteins for the saccharides conversion. Enzymes also held the promise of continuous
academic study which also had a peculiar advantage in the research fields. Lignin remains problematic and some attempts are at
hand to separate cellulose
 hemi cellulose and lignin prior to further processing. Most of these are pursuing agricultural raw
materials. The same problems of the processing of incoming MSW remain the same
 noting that many components of agri-wastes and
MSW share many characteristics and processing challenges in common. The real shortfall occurs from the seasonality of agricultural
cellulose sources and the costs to collect and transport adequate quantities of agricultural chaff.





sought out any customers because the Facility has yet to be built. Prior to the completion of the first phase of plant construction
the Company intends to make its first entry onto the Biofuel Marketplace seeking a long-term contract for 80% of its production.
The Company plans to sell 20% of its total production on the spot market or under short term contracts to take advantage of what
it believes to be a rising market demand and subsequent increase in ethanol prices.



    
    




:&nbsp; The
EU maintains two complementary pieces of legislation relating to renewable fuels: the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) and the
Fuel Quality Directive (FQD). Together
 these directives establish targets for the adoption of renewable fuels in EU member states
by 2020. Transportation fuels are one category of fuels covered by these directives
 and the targeted goals cover all renewable
fuels &ndash; that is
 they are not limited to ethanol. The FQD is relevant to the present discussion in that it establishes a
limit of 10% for ethanol blending within EU member states
 which are obligated to adopt national laws in conformance with the
requirements of the directive.


Renewable Energy Directive (RED) requires that by 2020 all transportation fuels in the EU must contain 10% Biofuel. Individual
EU states are free to incrementally build up to this target as they see fit
 meaning that current mandated levels vary. Nevertheless
the fines incurred by fuel producers for not meeting local requirements offer some measure of demand stability. Of course
 given
that the mandates are dictated as percentages
 declines in the consumption of the primary fuel for example
 gasoline or diesel
&ndash; will also affect Biofuel demand.


apply to Biofuels across the board
 but there are numerous other legislative changes that are set to affect specific products
in different ways. Biofuels produced from a raw material that is not part of the food chain
 known as second-generation Biofuels
are set to count double when tallying up the bio-content of a fuel blend. This will include Biodiesel
 which is made from used
cooking oil and Ethanol produced from crude glycerin
 which is itself a by-product of Biodiesel production. These changes add
up to a positive future for the product
 which has yet to enjoy widespread usage.




based on management&rsquo;s belief that there is a significant market demand for fuel grade Ethanol and other Biofuels derived
from sources other than agricultural feedstock and which are fully sustainable without impacting the food supply chain. The Company
believes that its revenue model has the capability to provide substantial and predictable recurring revenue because it uses waste
materials
 MSW and agricultural waste at no feedstock costs to the enterprise. In addition to the negative feedstock costs
 the
Company will be receiving substantial gate fees for taking in the waste as well as other environmental cash credits from the EU.
The Company has developed a multi-faceted revenue model that is expected
 over time
 to provide recurring revenue from the following
sources:

2020. The United States has set up an ambitious target to produce about 8 billion gallons annually by 2012 and about 40 billion
gallons by 2022. Though the energy companies are widening their portfolios to include Biofuels
 the move is fraught by significant
challenges such as types of fuels to be used
 regulations and regulatory approvals
 increased usage of land for cultivating Biofuel
crops and diversion of food crops for fuel production which is resulting in the increase of food prices.

the realization of the billion-metric ton renewable fuels vision
 this Memorandum integrates technological development and business
development rationales to highlight the key technological developments that are necessary to industrialize Biofuels on a global
scale. Technological issues addressed in this work include fermentation and downstream processing technologies
 as compared to
current industrial practice and process economics. Business issues that provide the lens through which the technological review
is performed span the entire Biofuel value chain

investment where a parent company starts a new venture in a foreign country by constructing new operational facilities from the
ground up. In addition to building new facilities
 most parent companies also create new long-term jobs in the foreign country
by hiring new employees. Emphasis has been placed throughout the book on providing a global view that takes into account the intrinsic

We operate in an intensely competitive
industry and we may not be able to compete effectively.


 marketing
and sale of alternative fuels is highly competitive. Competition could be intense and result in increases in the costs of raw
materials
 plant construction and operating expenses
 as well as make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified engineers
chemists and other employees whose services could be key to our operations as they develop. Larger companies that are already
engaged in this business may have access to greater financial and other resources
 making it difficult to compete with them in
recruiting and retaining qualified employees
 in acquiring attractive locations for the construction and operation of future production
facilities
 and selling our products at competitive prices.

New plants under construction or
decreases in the demand for biofuels may result in excess production capacity in our industry.


and the amount of biofuels produced will likely continue to increase in the near future
 which may lead to excess biofuel production
capacity.&nbsp;&nbsp; In a manufacturing industry with excess capacity
 producers have an incentive to manufacture additional
products for so long as the price exceeds the marginal cost of production (i.e.
 the cost of producing only the next unit
 without
regard for interest
 overhead or fixed costs). This incentive can result in the reduction of the market price of biofuel to a
level that is inadequate to generate sufficient cash flow to cover costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Excess capacity may also result from decreases
in the demand for biofuel
 which could result from a number of factors
 including increased governmental regulation
 the elimination
or modification of governmental incentives
 the development of other technologies or products that compete with biofuel
 or reduced
fuel consumption generally. Excess capacity in the biofuel industry or the reduction of the market price for biofuel could have
an adverse effect on our results of operations
 cash flows and financial position.

The production of biofuel requires
that we purchase significant amounts of raw materials
 such as biomass waste

to procure.


amounts of biomass waste. We will be required to purchase significant amounts of raw materials
 such as biomass waste
 paper waste
and other materials. Such raw materials may be unavailable which could significantly reduce our ability to produce biofuels.

Our business is highly sensitive
to the gate fees we receive and the prices we pay for biomass waste
 and any future price adjustments could increase our operating
costs and may adversely affect our operating results.

Negative consumer perceptions of
biofuel may impair or prevent the acceptance of biofuel in the marketplace
 which could harm our business.


and general public acceptance of biofuel is uncertain. Public acceptance of biofuel as a reliable
 high-quality alternative transport
fuel may be limited or slower than anticipated. Even if our production processes consistently produce biofuel that complies with
applicable standards
 actual or perceived problems with quality control in the industry generally may lead to a lack of consumer
confidence in biofuel and harm our ability to successfully market biofuel. Quality control issues in biofuel that is produced
by other industry participants could result in a decrease in demand or mandates for biofuel
 with a resulting decrease in our
revenue. Furthermore
 any negative media reports
 whether substantiated or not
 may adversely affect the demand for our biofuel
which in turn could decrease our sales
 harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition.

safety of our employees. In addition
 some of these laws and regulations require our facilities to operate under permits that
are subject to renewal or modification. These laws
 regulations and permits can often require expensive pollution control equipment
or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment. A violation of these laws and regulations or permit

 more vigorous enforcement policies and discovery of currently unknown
conditions may require substantial expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
position.

The passage of new European and Maltese energy legislation
 or the revocation or amendment of existing laws

 could have a significant adverse effect on the biofuel industry in general and our business
specifically. We cannot assure you that any of the laws
 regulations or programs from which our business benefits will continue
in the future or that these laws
 regulations or programs will benefit us or benefit us more than our competitors.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The elimination or reduction of government subsidies and tax incentives could cause the cost of biofuel to increase to the point
where it is not feasible to economically produce and market biofuel
 which could require us to abandon our business plan and cease
operations.

Our competitive position

 or cause the biofuel we produce to be of a lesser
quality than the biofuel produced by our competitors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also
 any advance in biofuel process technology could make our
Malta facility less competitive
 less efficient or obsolete
 any of which could lower the revenue we would otherwise earn from
our product sales.&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not predict when new technologies may become available
 the rate of acceptance of new technologies
by our competitors or the costs associated with new technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition
 advances in the development of alternatives
to biofuel could significantly reduce demand or eliminate the need for biofuel.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any advances in technology which require
significant capital expenditures to remain competitive or which reduce demand or prices for biofuel would have a material adverse

a timely and effective fashion

officers or other key personnel.&nbsp;&nbsp; The loss of any of our officers could delay or prevent the achievement of our business

Competition for qualified personnel
in the biofuel industry is intense and we may be unable to hire and retain qualified managers and other key personnel.


at our Malta facility
 we will need to hire additional employees to manage and operate the plant.&nbsp;&nbsp; Competition to attract

a result of significant growth in the number of companies producing biofuel and other alternative fuels.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we are
unable to attract and retain key personnel
 we may be unable to successfully execute our business plan and our financial condition

It may be more difficult for us

in response to public concerns regarding corporate accountability in connection with recent accounting scandals. The stated goals
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are to increase corporate responsibility
 to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing
improprieties at publicly traded companies
 and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures
pursuant to the securities laws. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act generally applies to all companies that file or are required to file periodic
reports with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.&nbsp; The enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has led
to a series of rules and regulations by the SEC that significantly increases the responsibilities and potential liabilities of
directors and executive officers. &nbsp; Because of the perceived increased personal risk associated with acting as an executive
officer or director of a public company

If a public market develops for our common stock
 the
market price may be particularly volatile and you may be unable to sell your common stock at or above your purchase price

may result in substantial losses to you.


 it is likely
to be characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers
 and we expect that our share price will
continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fluctuations in share price could be
based on various factors in addition to those otherwise described in this prospectus
 including:



    
    
Our operating performance and the performance
    of our competitors;

    
    
The public&rsquo;s reaction to our press releases

Changes in earnings estimates or recommendations

sale and notice requirements of Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 in the case of some shareholders
 desire to sell their
shares. Sales of a substantial number of these shares in the public market

cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition
 the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise
capital through the sale of additional equity securities.

Future
issuance of our Common Stock could dilute the interests of existing shareholders.

of substantially diluting the interests of our shareholders. In addition
 the sale of a substantial amount of Common Stock in
the public market
 either in the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale by the target company in an acquisition which received
such Common Stock as consideration or by investors who acquired such Common Stock in a private placement could have an adverse
effect on the market price of our Common Stock.




 we have paid no cash dividends
on our common shares. For the foreseeable future
 earnings generated from our operations will be retained for use in our business

The application
of the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules to our Common Stock could limit trading activity
in the market
 and our shareholders may find it more difficult to sell their stock.


our Common Stock will be trading at less than $5.00 per share and is therefore subject to the SEC penny stock rules. Penny stocks
generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00. Penny stock rules require a broker-dealer
 prior to a transaction
in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules
 to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information
about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid
and offer quotations for the penny stock
 the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction
 and monthly
account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer&rsquo;s account. The broker-dealer must also
make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser&rsquo;s
written agreement to the transaction. These requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity
 if any
in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers
by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities
 which could severely limit their
market price and liquidity of our securities. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our Common
Stock and may affect your ability to resell our Common Stock.

 2015 and 2014 and the related statements of operations
changes in stockholders&rsquo; deficit and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is
not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances
 but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.


 the financial statements
referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of Bio-En Holdings Corp as of December 31
2015 and 2014 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the period described above in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.


have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements
the Company has not established any source of revenue to cover its operating costs. As of December 31
 2015
 the Company does
not have sufficient working capital and cash resources to meet its planned business objectives. These and other factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. Management&rsquo;s plan regarding these matters

NOTE 2 &ndash; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The principal accounting policies are
set out below
 these policies have been consistently applied to the period presented
 unless otherwise stated:



have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern
 which contemplates the realization of assets and
the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As at December 31
 2015
 the Company has a working capital deficit
of $288
355
 an accumulated loss of $446
665 and has not earned any revenues to cover its operating costs. The Company intends
to fund future operations through equity financing arrangements
 which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures
 working
capital and other cash requirements for the year ending December 31
 2016.


its business plan is dependent upon
 among other things
 obtaining additional financing to continue operations
 and development
of its business plan. In response to these problems
 management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement
offerings.


 among others
 raise substantial
doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.



in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts or revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.



    
    




that is subject to rapid change. The Company's operations will be subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial
operational
 technological
 regulatory and other risks
 including the potential of business failure.



therefore segment information is not presented.



with initial maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its cash balances at credit-worthy financial institutions
that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&quot;FDIC&quot;) up to $250
000.

Property
 Plant and Equipment

lives are not amortized
 but instead are tested for impairment annually
 or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible
impairment may exist. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives
generally on a straight-line basis
 and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value may not be recoverable.



(&quot;FASB&quot;) Accounting Standards Codification (&quot;ASC&quot;) 310
 &ldquo;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-lived Assets&rdquo;
 the Company periodically reviews whether changes have occurred that would require revisions to the carrying
amounts of its definite lived
 long-lived assets. When the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount
of the asset
 an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset.



are carried at amortized cost and represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company prior to the end of the
financial year that are unpaid and arise when the Company becomes obliged to make future payments in respect of the purchase of
these goods and services.



of 3% of gross revenues or $330
000. Royalties are payable within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. The first minimum
royalty payment of $330
000 (including of VAT) is due 30 days after the first anniversary following the Company receiving initial
project development funding
 client contract or initiation of engineering and shall be due annually thereafter. Royalties are
expensed in the statements of operation in the period that the related revenues are recognized
 in cost of sales.



for all equity&ndash;based payments in accordance with ASC 718 &ldquo;Share-based payments&quot;. Under fair value recognition
provisions
 the Company recognizes equity&ndash;based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognizes compensation
cost only for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award.


 including
grants of employee stock options
 are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values.
That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award
known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period).



    
    



payments granted to non&ndash;employees in accordance with ASC 505
 &ldquo;Equity Based Payments to Non&ndash;Employees&rdquo;.
The Company determines the fair value of the stock&ndash;based payment as either the fair value of the consideration received
or the fair value of the equity instruments issued
 whichever is more reliably measurable. If the fair value of the equity instruments
issued is used
 it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of either (1) the date
at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached
 or (2) the date at which
the counterparty&rsquo;s performance is complete.



in accordance with ASC 260
 &quot;Earnings Per Share&quot; ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per
share (&ldquo;EPS&rdquo;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable
to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS
is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders and the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the effects of all potential dilutive common shares
 which comprise convertible compensation to employees.


 97
500
on December 31
 2015 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share on the statement of operations due to
the fact that the Company reported a net loss in 2015 and to do so would be anti-dilutive.



under FASB Codification Topic 740-10-25 (&ldquo;ASC 740-10-25&rdquo;). Under ASC 740-10-25
 deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. Under ASC 740-10-25
 the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date.



at fair value based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements
 which represents
the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability
 as the case may be
 in an orderly transaction
between market participants. As such
 fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an
asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair
value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs
 used in valuation techniques
 are assigned a hierarchical level.


of inputs to measure fair value:

prices in active markets for identical instruments;

inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments);

(including assumptions in determining the fair value of certain investments).



 the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&ldquo;ASU&rdquo;) No. 2014-10&mdash;Development Stage
Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
 Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities
Guidance in Topic 810
 Consolidation. ASU 2014-10 eliminates several of the reporting requirements for development stage entities
including the requirement to present inception to date information in the statements of income
 cash flows
 and shareholder equity
and to label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity. ASU 2014-10 also clarifies that the guidance in
ASC Topic 275 Risks and Uncertainties
 is applicable to entities that have not commenced principal operations
 and eliminates
an exception to the sufficiency-of-equity risk criterion for development stage entities
 and will require all reporting entities
that have an interest in development stage enterprises to apply consistent consolidation guidance for variable interest entities.
ASU 2014-10 is effective for all annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014
 with early adoption permitted. The
Company has elected to early adopt these amendments and accordingly has not labelled the financial statements as those of a development
stage entity and has not presented inception-to-date information on the respective financial statements.



    
    



 FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15
&ldquo;Preparation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)
 Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability
to Continue as a Going Concern.&rdquo; ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management&rsquo;s responsibility to evaluate whether
there is substantial doubt about an entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.
Specifically
 ASU 2014-15 provides a definition of the term substantial doubt and requires an assessment for a period of one year
after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). It also requires certain disclosures when
substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&rsquo;s plans and requires an express statement and
other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated. The new standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning
after December 15
 2016
 with early adoption permitted. The Company will evaluate the going concern considerations in this ASU
however
 at the current period
 management does not believe that it has met conditions which would subject these financial statements
for additional disclosure.

it is more efficient to have the leadership of the Board in the same hands as the principal executive officer of the Company.
The challenges faced by the Company at this stage &ndash; obtaining financing and performing research and development activities
&ndash; are most efficiently dealt with by having one person intimately familiar with both the operational aspects as well as
the strategic aspects of the Company&rsquo;s business.

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&amp;#8220;ASU&amp;#8221;) No. 2014-10&amp;#151;Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
 Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810
 Consolidation. ASU 2014-10 eliminates several of the reporting requirements for development stage entities
 including the requirement to present inception to date information in the statements of income
 cash flows
 and shareholder equity
 and to label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity. ASU 2014-10 also clarifies that the guidance in ASC Topic 275 Risks and Uncertainties
 is applicable to entities that have not commenced principal operations
 and eliminates an exception to the sufficiency-of-equity risk criterion for development stage entities
 and will require all reporting entities that have an interest in development stage enterprises to apply consistent consolidation guidance for variable interest entities. ASU 2014-10 is effective for all annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014

 FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15 &amp;#8220;Preparation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)
 Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.&amp;#8221; ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management&amp;#8217;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&amp;#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. Specifically
 ASU 2014-15 provides a definition of the term substantial doubt and requires an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). It also requires certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&amp;#8217;s plans and requires an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated. The new standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 with early adoption permitted. The Company will evaluate the going concern considerations in this ASU

<font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'
Common stock equivalents totaling, <font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'
 on December 31, 2015 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share on the statement of operations due to the fact that the Company reported a net loss in 2015 and to do so would be anti-dilutive.<font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'
<font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'
The Company accounts for income taxes under FASB Codification Topic 740-10-25 (&#8220;ASC 740-10-25&#8221;). Under ASC 740-10-25, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740-10-25, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.<font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'

- Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs (including assumptions in determining the fair value of certain investments).<font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'
<font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'
In August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15 &#8220;Preparation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.&#8221; ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management&#8217;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. Specifically, ASU 2014-15 provides a definition of the term substantial doubt and requires an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). It also requires certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&#8217;s plans and requires an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated. The new standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company will evaluate the going concern considerations in this ASU, however, at the current period, management does not believe that it has met conditions which would subject these financial statements for additional disclosure.<font style=FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'

Share-based payments to employees
 including grants of employee stock options
 are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award
The Company accounts for share&#150;based payments granted to non&#150;employees in accordance with ASC 505
 &#8220;Equity Based Payments to Non&#150;Employees&#8221;. The Company determines the fair value of the stock&#150;based payment as either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued
 whichever is more reliably measurable. If the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used
 it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of either (1) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached
 or (2) the date at which the counterparty&#8217;s performance is complete.



Earnings Per Share
 Policy [Policy Text Block]
The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260
 Earnings Per Share ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the effects of all potential dilutive common shares
Common stock equivalents totaling


 2015 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share on the statement of operations due to the fact that the Company reported a net loss in 2015 and to do so would be anti-dilutive.



Income Tax
 Policy [Policy Text Block]
The Company accounts for income taxes under FASB Codification Topic 740-10-25 (&#8220;ASC 740-10-25&#8221;). Under ASC 740-10-25
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740-10-25
 the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.



Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 Policy [Policy Text Block]
The Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements
 which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability
 as the case may be
 in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such
 fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs
 used in valuation techniques
 are assigned a hierarchical level.




In June 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2014-10&#151;Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements
 Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810
 Consolidation. ASU 2014-10 eliminates several of the reporting requirements for development stage entities
 including the requirement to present inception to date information in the statements of income
 cash flows
 and shareholder equity
 and to label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity. ASU 2014-10 also clarifies that the guidance in ASC Topic 275 Risks and Uncertainties
 is applicable to entities that have not commenced principal operations
 and eliminates an exception to the sufficiency-of-equity risk criterion for development stage entities
 and will require all reporting entities that have an interest in development stage enterprises to apply consistent consolidation guidance for variable interest entities. ASU 2014-10 is effective for all annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014
In August 2014
 FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15 &#8220;Preparation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)
 Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.&#8221; ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management&#8217;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. Specifically
 ASU 2014-15 provides a definition of the term substantial doubt and requires an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). It also requires certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&#8217;s plans and requires an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated. The new standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2016
 with early adoption permitted. The Company will evaluate the going concern considerations in this ASU
 however
 at the current period
 management does not believe that it has met conditions which would subject these financial statements for additional disclosure.


























































































































Disclosure of accounting policy for cash and cash equivalents
 including the policy for determining which items are treated as cash equivalents. Other information that may be disclosed includes (1) the nature of any restrictions on the entity's use of its cash and cash equivalents
 (2) whether the entity's cash and cash equivalents are insured or expose the entity to credit risk
 (3) the classification of any negative balance accounts (overdrafts)
 and (4) the carrying basis of cash equivalents (for example
 at cost) and whether the carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value.

























































Disclosure of accounting policy for computing basic and diluted earnings or loss per share for each class of common stock and participating security. Addresses all significant policy factors
 including any antidilutive items that have been excluded from the computation and takes into account stock dividends
 splits and reverse splits that occur after the balance sheet date of the latest reporting period but before the issuance of the financial statements.






















































































Disclosure of accounting policy for income taxes
 which may include its accounting policies for recognizing and measuring deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowances
 recognizing investment tax credits
 operating loss carryforwards
 tax credit carryforwards
 and other carryforwards
 methodologies for determining its effective income tax rate and the characterization of interest and penalties in the financial statements.

























































Disclosure of accounting policy for long-lived
 physical assets used in the normal conduct of business and not intended for resale. Includes
 but is not limited to
 basis of assets
 depreciation and depletion methods used
 including composite deprecation
