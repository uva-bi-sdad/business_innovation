 cartons or powdered
 frozen
 flavored
 carbonated and sweetened. With all these choices it can be confusing and difficult to know if you are choosing the best one. The Company&#8217;s product competes broadly with all beverages available to consumers. The coconut water industry is highly competitive with estimated sales in the United States of 1 billion dollars and growing. We estimate that there are approximately 50 bottled coconut water brands in the United States with sales concentrated among the larger companies
 especially those controlled by PepsiCo and Coca-Cola. Nearly all of our competitors are more experienced
 have vastly greater financial and management resources and have more established proprietary trademarks and distribution networks than we do. On a national basis
 we would compete with large beverage companies
 such as PepsiCo (which produces O.N.E Coconut Water)
 Coca-Cola (which produces Zico coconut water). Other brands include Vito CoCo (partially owned by Red Bull) Harmless Harvest
 Invo Coconut Water
 Taste Nirvana Coconut water and CocoZona to name a few competitions for market share in the coconut water industry. These and other competitors are likely to have distribution channels for their products that we do not have
 which places us at a significant disadvantage. While the Company believes that it can compete favorably on differentiation providing our proposed organic non-additive coconut water
 we are yet to see if we can compete in quality
 merchandising and are weak with regards to
 brand name recognition and loyalty
 there can be no assurance that the Company and its product lines will not experience increasing competitive pressures from both traditional and new age beverage companies
 many of whom have substantially greater marketing
 cash
 distribution
 technical and other resources than the Company.

 we will need the funding from this offering.

 and (ii) begin Phase II of our program

 we anticipate spending $550
000 on program development
 professional and administrative fees
 including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement
 complying with reporting obligations and arranging financing for Phases I and II of our development program. Total expenditures over the next 12 - 14 months are therefore expected to be approximately $550
000. If we experience a shortage of funds prior to funding during the next 12 -14 months
 we may utilize funds from Mr. Baterina
 our Chairman of the Board of Directors
 who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees
 including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses
 however he has no formal commitment
 arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. We will require the funds from this offering to proceed. If we receive only nominal funds from this offering
 we plan to operate on a limited basis for the limited purpose of meeting our reporting obligations to the Securities and Exchange Commission. No such plan exists at this time in case of such contingency
 and we cannot guarantee we would be able to raise additional funding if only nominal funding is obtained from this offering. New management will not as of the date of this filing change its business.


 we plan to commence activities to raise the $400
000 in funds required for Phase II of the development program in December of 2017. We expect this phase to take 120 - 180 days to complete and an additional 9 to 12 months for distribution networks and market acceptance. We cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to proceed with any work or activities on Phase I and or II of the development program since we currently have no plan in place to raise these funds. We plan to raise the additional funding for Phase I and Phase II by way of a private debt or equity financing
 but have not commenced any activities to raise such funds. 


 we have not commenced with any activities or operations of any phase of our development program.

 that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to our recurring losses from operations
 deficit in equity
 and the need to raise additional capital to fund operations. A &#8220;going concern&#8221; opinion could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of debt or equity securities.



Fiscal Year Ended August 31
 2017 compared to the Fiscal Year Ended August 31
 2016


 2016 (inception) to August 31
 2017.


 2017 totaled $25
190 consisting primarily of office and general expenses of $9
240 consisting primarily of $2
942; Office expenses of $2
007; transfer agent expenses of $2
329; website expenses of $1
816 and bank services charges of $146; and professional fees of $15
950 resulting in a net loss of $25
190. Expenses for the period from July 26
 2016 (date of inception) to August 31
 2016 totaled $1
339 consisting primarily of office and general expenses of $1
339
 resulting in a net loss of $1
339. The increase in office and general expenses from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the increase expenses relating to filing fees
 transfer agent expenses and website expenes. The increase in professional fees from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2016 was due to the increase in accounting and legal fees activities during the period. In additional marketing expenses occurred in the fiscal 2017 period.
















 2017 financial statements expresses an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as an ongoing business. Since our sole director maybe unwilling or unable to loan or advance us additional capital
 we believe that if we do not raise additional capital over the next 12 months
 we may be required to suspend or cease the implementation of our business plans. See &#8220;August 31
 2017 Audited Financial Statements &#8211; Auditors Report.&#8221;


 2017
 we had $4
211 of cash compared to $10
336 of cash as of August 31

 the Company has a working deficit of $6
939. The Company requires additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly
 these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue to fund its business by way of private placements and advances from related parties as may be required. As of August 31
 2017 the Company has issued 800

 (ii) the sales terms are fixed or determinable
 (iii) title and risk of loss have transferred

 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment. 




 Stock Compensation
 which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services
 with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 is a revision to SFAS No. 123
 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25
 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized. The Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. As at May 31
 2017 the Company had not adopted a stock option plan nor had it granted any stock options. Accordingly no stock-based compensation has been recorded to date.

 as required by Rule 13a -15d and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our company&#8217;s management
 including our company&#8217;s principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based upon that evaluation
 our company&#8217;s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of August 31

 2017
 management determined material weaknesses occurred over our internal control over financial reporting as discussed below.


 resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (4) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. Due to these material weaknesses management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of August 31
 2017.




 (3) and (4) above did not have an affect on the Company's previous reported financial results. However
 management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's board of directors
 resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures can result in the Company's determination to its financial statements for the future periods.














 we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to the Company: i) Appointing one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to the audit committee of the Company resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and ii) Preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements.

 management believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the following material weaknesses (i) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (ii) ineffective controls over period end financial close and reporting processes. Further
 management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge will result proper segregation of duties and provide more checks and balances within the department. Additional personnel will also provide the cross training needed to support the Company if personnel turn over issues within the department occur. This coupled with the appointment of additional outside directors will greatly decrease any control and procedure issues the company may encounter in the future.

KOKOS
GROUP INC. was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on July 26
 2016 and established a fiscal year end
of August 31. The Company is organized to bottle
 market
 distribute and sell our own brand of coconut water
 presently called
&#147;Koos Coconut Water&#148;. On November 10
 2017 the Board of directors and the majority of its shareholders of Kokos Group
Inc.
 amended the Company&#146;s current Certificate of Incorporation in conformity with the applicable laws of the State of
Nevada to change the name of the Company from Kokos Group Inc. to China Wu Yi Mountain Ltd. The Company is waiting for approval
of the name change from FINRA.

On
October 19
 2017 Mr. Lei Wang became its Chief Executive Officer
 Chief Financial Officer and sole Director and Mr. Richard Rappaprt
was appointed Secretary. In addition Mr. Baterina and Messrs. Flemming H.H. Hansen and Arthur T. Claravall submitted his resignations
from all executive officer positions with the Company
 including Chief Executive Officer and President effective October 19
 2017
and each submitted their resignation as a member of the Board. On January 18
 2018
 Richard Rappaport submitted his resignation
as Secretary of Kokos Group Inc. (the &#34;Company&#34;)
 effective immediately. On the same day
 Ying Zhang was appointed Secretary
effective immediately.

Going
concern
To
date the Company has generated no revenues from its business operations and has incurred operating losses since inception of $26
529.
As at August 31
 2017
 the Company has a working deficit of $6
939. The Company requires additional funding to meet its ongoing
obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on
raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly
 these factors raise
substantial doubt as to the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue to fund its
business by way of private placements and advances from related parties as may be required. As of August 31
 2017 the Company
has issued 800
000
000 founders shares at $0.0000125 per share for net proceeds of $10
000 to the Company and private placements
of 25
600
000 common shares at $0.000375 per share for net proceeds of $9
600. These financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts
 or amounts and classification of liabilities that
might result from this uncertainty.



































The entire disclosure for the business description and basis of presentation concepts.  Business description describes the nature and type of organization including but not limited to organizational structure as may be applicable to holding companies
 parent and subsidiary relationships
 business divisions
 business units
 business segments
 affiliates and information about significant ownership of the reporting entity.  Basis of presentation describes the underlying basis used to prepare the financial statements (for example
 US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
 Other Comprehensive Basis of Accounting
 IFRS).

Aug. 31
 2017








Basis
of Presentation

The
financial statements present the balance sheet
 statements of operations
 stockholders&#146; equity (deficit) and cash flows
of the Company. These financial statements are presented in the United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Segmented
Reporting

FSAB
ASC 280
 &#147;Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information&#148;
 changed the way public companies report
information about segments of their business in their quarterly reports issued to shareholders. It also requires entity-wide disclosures
about the products and services the entity provides
 the material countries in which it holds assets and reports revenues and
its major customers.

Comprehensive
Loss

ADVANCE
\d 5&#147;Reporting Comprehensive Income
&#148; establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and
its components in the financial statements. As at August 31
 2017 the Company has no items that represent a comprehensive loss
and
 therefore
 has not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the financial statements.

Use
of Estimates and Assumptions

Preparation
of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Accordingly
 actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows
 the Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Revenue
Recognition

The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC topic 605 &#147;Revenue Recognition
 and other applicable revenue recognition
guidance under US GAAP. Sales revenue is recognized for our retail and wholesale customers when: (i) persuasive evidence of a
sales arrangement exists
 (ii) the sales terms are fixed or determinable
 (iii) title and risk of loss have transferred
 and (iv)
collectability is reasonably assured &#151; generally when products are shipped to the customer and services are rendered
 except
in situations in which title passes upon receipt of the products by the customer. Revenue consists of revenue earned for the sale
of organic coconut water and services provided by the Company. Revenue is recognized at the time the product is shipped to the
customer and or services provided by the Company are fulfilled.

Financial
Instruments

All
significant financial assets
 financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in
the financial statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows
 interest
rate risk and credit risk. Where practical the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined
and disclosed; otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed.

Loss
per Common Share

The
basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company&#146;s net income available to common shareholders by the
weighted average number of common shares during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the
Company&#146;s net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for
any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share due
to the lack of dilutive items in the Company.

Income
Taxes

The
Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.

Stock-based
Compensation

The
Company follows ASC 718-10
 &#34;Stock Compensation&#34;
 which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity
exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services
 with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee
services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 is a revision to SFAS No. 123
 &#34;Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
&#34;
and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (&#34;APB&#34;) Opinion No. 25
 &#34;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
&#34;
and its related implementation guidance. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange
for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation
costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized. The Company has not adopted a stock
option plan and has not granted any stock options. As at May 31
 2017 the Company had not adopted a stock option plan nor had
it granted any stock options. Accordingly no stock-based compensation has been recorded to date.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

FASB
ASC 105-10
 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (Prior authoritative literature: FASB SFAS No. 165
 Subsequent Events (&#147;SFAS
165&#148;)
 issued May 28
 2009)
 which establishes general standards of accounting for
 and disclosure of
 events that occur
after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. FASB ASC 105-10 (SFAS 165)
is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after June 15
 2009. The adoption of FASB ASC 105-10 (SFAS 165) did
not have a material effect on the company&#146;s financial position or results of operations.

FASB
ASC 105-10-65
 The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (Prior
authoritative literature: FASB SFAS No. 168
 The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (&#147;SFAS 168&#148;
 issued June 2009)
 establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the
&#147;Codification&#148;) as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental U.S. GAAP. The Codification is effective for
interim and annual periods ending after September 15
 2009. The adoption of FASB ASC 105-10-65 (SFAS 168) did not have a material
impact on the Company&#146;s financial statements

In
September 2009
 the FASB issued guidance now codified as ASC 105
 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as the single source
of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of
financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
 aside from those issued by the SEC. ASC 105 does not change current U.S. GAAP
but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative U.S. GAAP by providing all authoritative literature related to a
particular topic in one place. The adoption of ASC 105 did not have a material impact on the Company&#146;s financial statements
but did eliminate all references to pre-codification standards.

On
February 24
 2010
 the FASB issued guidance in the &#34;Subsequent Events&#34; topic of the FASC to provide updates including:
(1) requiring the company to evaluate subsequent events through the date in which the financial statements are issued; (2) amending
the glossary of the &#34;Subsequent Events&#34; topic to include the definition of &#34;SEC filer&#34; and exclude the definition
of &#34;Public entity&#34;; and (3) eliminating the requirement to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been
evaluated. This guidance was prospectively effective upon issuance. The adoption of this guidance did not impact the Company's
results of operations of financial condition.

In
June 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-10
 &#147;Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting
Requirements
 Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810
 Consolidation&#148;. The guidance eliminates
the definition of a development stage entity thereby removing the incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP
for development stage entities
 primarily presentation of inception to date financial information. The provisions of the amendments
are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014
 and the interim periods therein. However
 early
adoption is permitted. Accordingly
 the Company has adopted this standard as of August 31

The

 2017 and August 31
 2016
 is as follows:

Net
    deferred income tax asset
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    


The
amount taken into income as deferred income tax assets must reflect that portion of the income tax loss carry forwards that is
more likely-than-not to be realized from future operations. The Company has chosen to provide a full valuation allowance against
all available income tax loss carry forwards. The Company has recognized a valuation allowance for the deferred income tax asset
since the Company cannot be assured that it is more likely than not that such benefit will be utilized in future years. The valuation
allowance is reviewed annually. When circumstances change and which cause a change in management's judgment about the realizability
of deferred income tax assets
 the impact of the change on the valuation allowance is generally reflected in current income.

As
of August 31
 2017 and August 31
 2016 the Company has no unrecognized income tax benefits. The Company&#8217;s policy for classifying
interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits is to include such items as tax expense. No interest or
penalties have been recorded during the year ended August 31
 2017 and August 31
 2016 and no interest or penalties have been
accrued as of August 31
 2017 and August 31
 2016. As of August 31
 2017 and August 31
 2016
 the Company did not have any amounts
recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions.

The
tax years from 2016 and forward remain open to examination by federal and state authorities due to net operating loss and credit
carryforwards. The Company is currently not under examination by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authorities.

Due
to a subsequent change in control
 certain losses may not be available for carryforward under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue
Code.

The
financial statements present the balance sheet
 statements of operations
 stockholders&#146; equity (deficit) and cash flows
of the Company. These financial statements are presented in the United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.




FSAB
ASC 280
 &#147;Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information&#148;
 changed the way public companies report
information about segments of their business in their quarterly reports issued to shareholders. It also requires entity-wide disclosures
about the products and services the entity provides
 the material countries in which it holds assets and reports revenues and
its major customers.




ADVANCE
\d 5&#147;Reporting Comprehensive Income
&#148; establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and
its components in the financial statements. As at August 31
 2017 the Company has no items that represent a comprehensive loss
and
 therefore
 has not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the financial statements.




Preparation
of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Accordingly
 actual
results could differ from those estimates.




For
purposes of the statement of cash flows
 the Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.




The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC topic 605 &#147;Revenue Recognition
 and other applicable revenue recognition
guidance under US GAAP. Sales revenue is recognized for our retail and wholesale customers when: (i) persuasive evidence of a
sales arrangement exists
 (ii) the sales terms are fixed or determinable
 (iii) title and risk of loss have transferred
 and (iv)
collectability is reasonably assured &#151; generally when products are shipped to the customer and services are rendered
 except
in situations in which title passes upon receipt of the products by the customer. Revenue consists of revenue earned for the sale
of organic coconut water and services provided by the Company. Revenue is recognized at the time the product is shipped to the
customer and or services provided by the Company are fulfilled.




All
significant financial assets
 financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in
the financial statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows
 interest
rate risk and credit risk. Where practical the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined
and disclosed; otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed.




The
basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company&#146;s net income available to common shareholders by the
weighted average number of common shares during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the
Company&#146;s net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for
any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share due
to the lack of dilutive items in the Company.




The
Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.




The
Company follows ASC 718-10
 &#34;Stock Compensation&#34;
 which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity
exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services
 with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee
services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 is a revision to SFAS No. 123
 &#34;Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
&#34;
and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (&#34;APB&#34;) Opinion No. 25
 &#34;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
&#34;
and its related implementation guidance. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange
for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation
costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized. The Company has not adopted a stock
option plan and has not granted any stock options. As at May 31
 2017 the Company had not adopted a stock option plan nor had
it granted any stock options. Accordingly no stock-based compensation has been recorded to date.




FASB
ASC 105-10
 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (Prior authoritative literature: FASB SFAS No. 165
 Subsequent Events (&#147;SFAS
165&#148;)
 issued May 28
 2009)
 which establishes general standards of accounting for
 and disclosure of
 events that occur
after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. FASB ASC 105-10 (SFAS 165)
is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after June 15
 2009. The adoption of FASB ASC 105-10 (SFAS 165) did
not have a material effect on the company&#146;s financial position or results of operations.

FASB
ASC 105-10-65
 The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (Prior
authoritative literature: FASB SFAS No. 168
 The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (&#147;SFAS 168&#148;
 issued June 2009)
 establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the
&#147;Codification&#148;) as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental U.S. GAAP. The Codification is effective for
interim and annual periods ending after September 15
 2009. The adoption of FASB ASC 105-10-65 (SFAS 168) did not have a material
impact on the Company&#146;s financial statements

In
September 2009
 the FASB issued guidance now codified as ASC 105
 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as the single source
of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of
financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
 aside from those issued by the SEC. ASC 105 does not change current U.S. GAAP
but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative U.S. GAAP by providing all authoritative literature related to a
particular topic in one place. The adoption of ASC 105 did not have a material impact on the Company&#146;s financial statements
but did eliminate all references to pre-codification standards.

On
February 24
 2010
 the FASB issued guidance in the &#34;Subsequent Events&#34; topic of the FASC to provide updates including:
(1) requiring the company to evaluate subsequent events through the date in which the financial statements are issued; (2) amending
the glossary of the &#34;Subsequent Events&#34; topic to include the definition of &#34;SEC filer&#34; and exclude the definition
of &#34;Public entity&#34;; and (3) eliminating the requirement to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been
evaluated. This guidance was prospectively effective upon issuance. The adoption of this guidance did not impact the Company's
results of operations of financial condition.

In
June 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-10
 &#147;Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting
Requirements
 Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810
 Consolidation&#148;. The guidance eliminates
the definition of a development stage entity thereby removing the incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP
for development stage entities
 primarily presentation of inception to date financial information. The provisions of the amendments
are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15
 2014
 and the interim periods therein. However
 early
adoption is permitted. Accordingly
 the Company has adopted this standard as of August 31
 2016.

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and
does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact
on its financial position or results of operations.
