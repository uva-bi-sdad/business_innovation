 Inc.



























Hispanica International Delights of America
 Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;HISP&#8221;) was incorporated on April 15
 2013 and is a Delaware company with the intention of entering the North American food and beverage distribution market with a focus on&#160;traditional Hispanic and ethnic inspired food and beverages.&#160;&#160;In October 2013
 the Company signed a distribution agreement with Gran Nevada Beverage
 Inc. (&#8220;Gran Nevada&#8221;&#160;or&#160;&#8220;GN&#8221;)
 a related party through common ownership and management. The agreement provides the Company with the right to sell and distribute Gran Nevada's beverages in Texas and California with purchase prices at the then applicable wholesale prices charged to Gran Nevada's distributors. The agreement is for an initial term of five years with automatic renewals of successive five year terms unless terminated.&#160;HISP initiated sales and distribution operations in March 2014.








On October 2013
 HISP&#160;signed&#160;&#160;a non-exclusive agreement to distribute all products from Gran Nevada&#160;&#160;Beverage
 Inc. HISP had its first sales in the third quarter
 and sold $101
781 in product that cost the Company $128
885 for a gross loss of ($27
104).&#160;&#160;HISP intends to consolidate food and beverage brands into a single distribution entity designed for retailers targeting Hispanic consumers and other demographics with a growing appreciation for Latin American cuisine. Brands sought by HISP are primarily engaged in the business of developing
 manufacturing
 marketing and selling unique
 premium
 non-alcoholic beverages as well as all natural food products that&#160;targeted toward Hispanic and ethnic-neutral consumers.





The Company buys pre-packaged goods for distribution through various channels. The Company began distributing the beverage products of Gran Nevada in the third fiscal quarter of 2014. Gran Nevada is the sole manufacturer for its product line
 and there are no alternate suppliers in the event that Gran Nevada or its suppliers are unable or unwilling to provide HISP with the products needed to meet demand.


As of October 5
 2013
 Gran Nevada had eight (8) SKUs that are manufactured in North America. The Gran Nevada products distributed are all natural
 not from&#160;concentrate
 preservative-free Aguas&#160;&#160;Frescas (Mexican Horchata
 Horchata de Morro
 Tamarindo
 Hibiscus
 Mango
 Guava
 Pineapple
 and Limeade). These products are geared&#160;towards&#160;the Hispanic market
 but may appeal&#160;to almost&#160;any palate. An important part of HISP's overall strategy will be the expansion through the acquisition of distributors.


HISP&#160;has sales through several distributors and regularly seeks to broaden its distribution channels.&#160;The Company has engaged third party sales and marketing brokers in many areas of the country. The Company also intends to sell directly to retailers
 including large chain stores.



























As a distributor of Hispanic and Ethnic packaged food products
 the Company expects to have a portfolio of products that will not only include beverages. The main competitors of the Company include Goya Foods
 Marquez Brothers International
 Diaz Foods
 La Fe Foods International
 Grace Foods
 as well as other regional Ethnic Food Distributors. HISP will focus&#160;on selecting brands of all natural packaged foods. Although some competitors are selling and distributing similar products
 they use different packaging options and in particular foods that have high contents of artificial flavors
 colors
 and sweeteners as well high sodium contents. For instance
 our competitors import the majority of the products they distribute which are made with lower price point raw materials and quality. The Company is currently working on adding more products to distribute.&#160;&#160;&#160;After signing a distribution Agreement with Gran Nevada
 HISP is negotiating with Racor
 LLC to distribute the Racor line of products
 including Tamal De Elote
 Maranon
 Horchata De Moro
 and Cebada from El Salvador in the United States.&#160; No distribution Agreement has been signed as of this filing.&#160;&#160;The terms of such agreements will be disclosed once Distribution Agreements are signed. Such products will be in other categories besides the beverage space.&#160;&#160;&#160;HISP will focus on distributing products that focus on the all natural nature of their ingredients as well as look to partner with brands that can manufacture products closer to its U.S. market base.&#160;


The packaged beverage market is highly competitive.&#160;&#160;Competitors in our market compete for brand recognition
 ingredient sourcing
 qualified personnel
 distribution and product shelf space.&#160;&#160;As a developing company
 a majority of our competitors are more established and better capitalized than us.&#160;&#160;The packaged beverage market is generally dominated by the largest beverage providers
 including The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo
 Inc.&#160;&#160;Many of our competitors enjoy significant brand recognition and consumer confidence and are able to readily secure shelf space and media attention for their products.&#160;&#160;Many of our competitors also have existing relationships with the same distribution channels and retailers through which we sell our products.&#160;&#160;We intend to compete in the market by offering consumers affordable products that taste better and possess a longer shelf life than most products in the market.





Packaged beverage and juice&#160;products are governed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&#160;&#160;As such
 it is necessary for the Company to ensure its products distributed establish
 maintain and make available for inspection
 records and labels with nutrition information that meet legal food labeling requirements.&#160;&#160;The Company&#8217;s products are manufactured by contracted production facilities that are subject to many regulations
 including Food Facility Registration
 recordkeeping
 Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements
 reporting
 preventive controls and inspections.





As of May 31
 2014
 the Company had no full-time employees.&#160;Personnel are independent contractors or insider owners who do not receive cash compensation. The Company mitigates the need for a production staff by purchasing finished inventory.&#160;The Company has contracted with food brokers to represent GRAN NEVADA&#174; to retail stores nationally.&#160;In certain regions of the United States
 we utilize the services of direct sales and distribution companies
 which sell our products through their distribution channels.&#160;This can mitigate the need for a large sales and merchandising force.&#160;The Company also outsources its logistics to third-parties
 which can reduce the need for employees in these roles.




The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 15
 2013 under the name&#160;Hispanica International Delights of America
 Inc.&#160;(&#8220;HISP&#8221;) for the purpose of&#160;Hispanic and ethnic packaged foods distribution. Hispanica International Delights of America
 Inc. is a development stage business that has commenced initial operations pursuant to a non-exclusive distribution agreement with Gran Nevada Beverage
 Inc. (&#8220;GN&#8221;).&#160;Mr. Fernando Oswaldo Leonzo is currently President of Gran Nevada Beverage
 Inc. as well as current Chairman &amp; CEO of Hispanica International Delights of America
 Inc.(HISP). He currently only owns an equity stake in HISP but none in GN. He serves on the management team of both companies. For further details please refer to the Bio Section (Item 10).




















In October 2013
 the Company signed a distribution agreement with&#160;Gran Nevada Beverage
 Inc.
 a privately held Deleware corporation (GN).&#160;Pursuant to the non-exclusive distribution agreement
 the Company has the right to distribute Gran Nevada 16oz glass beverage products&#160;(such as Mango
 Guava
 Tamarind
 Hibiscus
 Pineapple
 and Limeade Juices and Nectars) in North America&#160;with a focus on California and Texas. Gran Nevada will continue to service its current distribution&#160;network of Ethnic Grocer Distributors. Though HISP&#160;has not yet commenced full operations
 it has begun to seek out&#160;warehouse and leasing locations in California and Texas for the purpose of doing DSD (Direct Store Distribution) in those regions.&#160;HISP will be given the territory of North America (excluding Central America) for the GN beverage line.&#160;The Distribution Agreement allows HISP the right to purchase all GN products at distribution pricing and it is for a term of Sixty Months with an automatic renewal&#160;unless terminated.&#160;GN will retain the right to distribute its products to other parties in Central America as well as develop and sell other food items under the GN brand.&#160;Gran Nevada brand products have focused product sales on the Hispanic market
 which represents the largest growing segment of the U.S. population. We have earned limited revenues to-date
 and Gran Nevada's revenues are not indicative of our current or future revenue.

Currently
 the Company has three directors who have assumed responsibility for all planning
 development and operational duties and will continue to do so throughout the beginning stages of operations.&#160;

An investment in our common stock involves a number of very significant risks. You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties in addition to other information in this prospectus in evaluating our company and our business before purchasing shares of our common stock. Our business
 operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed as a result of the occurrence of any of the following risks. You could lose all or part of your investment due to any of these risks.



We are a development stage company with no operating history and have maintained losses since inception
 which we expect to continue into the future.

We are a newly organized development stage company incorporated on April 15
 2013 and have very limited operations. We have had limited revenues to date. The Company only generated revenue in the third quarter
 which was the first time it had revenue. Gross revenue for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year was $101
781. The net loss for fiscal year 2014 was $175
476. This compares to a net loss for fiscal year 2013 of $26
273.&#160;Since the Company was founded in April 2013
 and it has a May 31 fiscal year-end
 the Company's full year 2013 results only consist of the last 45 days of the year or the second half of&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; the fourth quarter.&#160;Our business is in the&#160;business of distribution of Hispanic and ethnic packaged foods and beverages. We have no operating history at all upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. Our net loss from inception to&#160;May 31
 2014 is $201
749.&#160;&#160;If we cannot attract a significant number of customers
 we will not be able to generate any significant revenues or income. Failure to generate revenues will cause us to go out of business because we will not have the money to pay our ongoing expenses.



We will need to raise funds through public or private debt or sale of equity to implement our Plan of Operation. If our Offering is unsuccessful
 we may need to resort to alternative means of financing cover expenses as they arise in the future. Such financing may not be available when needed. Even if such financing is available
 it may be on terms that are materially adverse to your interests with respect to dilution of book value
 dividend preferences
 liquidation preferences
 or other terms.

Since our&#160;officers currently work without compensation our current cash of $21
136 should be sufficient to cover our operating expenses through December 2014. We will need to generate revenues and/ obtain additional funds in order to maintain and expand our operations or deal with any unexpected expenses as they arise. We require funding to acquire inventory to generate revenues. No assurance can be given that such funds will be available or
 if available
 will be on commercially reasonable terms satisfactory to us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing if and when it is needed on terms we deem acceptable.

If we are unable to obtain financing on reasonable terms
 we could be forced to delay or scale back our plan of operations. In addition
 such inability to obtain financing on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business
 operating results
 or financial condition.



Our independent auditors
 David A.Aronson
 CPA
 P.A. state in their audit report
 August 28
 2014 and included herein
 that we are a development stage company
 have no established source of revenue and are dependent on our ability to raise capital from shareholders or other sources to sustain operations. As a result
 there is a substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern.

















This qualification clearly highlights that we will
 in all likelihood
 continue to incur expenses without significant revenues into the foreseeable future until our services gains significant popularity. Our only source of funds to date has been the sale of our common stock. Because we cannot currently assure anyone that we will be able to generate enough interest in our services
 or that we will be able to generate any significant revenues or income
 the identification of new sources of equity financing becomes significantly more difficult. If we are successful in closing on any new financing
 existing investors will experience substantial dilution. The ability to obtain debt financing is also severely impacted
 and likely not even feasible
 given that we do not have revenues or profits to pay interest or repay principal.


As a result
 if we are unable to obtain additional financing at this stage in our operations
 our business will fail and you may lose some or all of your investment in our common stock.



Our success is dependent in part upon the accuracy of our management&#8217;s estimates of expenditures. If such estimates are erroneous or inaccurate we may not be able to carry out our business plan
 which could
 in a worst-case scenario
 result in the failure of our business and you losing your entire investment.



We expect to face strong competition from well-established companies and small independent companies like our own that actively manage and grow their own distribution network. These competitors may maintain significantly larger resources
 personnel and distribution channels as well as retail customer base that better satisfy our prospective clients&#8217; needs. Additionally
 this industry has minimum barriers to entry and as a result there are no assurances that the Company will not face increased competition in the future.

We expect to be less able than our larger competitors to cope with generally increasing costs and expenses of doing business. Additionally
 it is expected that there may be significant technological advances in the future and we may not have adequate creative management and resources to enable us to take advantage of those advances.

We depend to a significant extent on certain key personnel
 the loss of any of whom may materially and adversely affect our company.

Currently
 we have no&#160;employees
 but we depend&#160;&#160;primarily on Fernando Oswaldo Leonzo and Robert Gunther&#160;for our operations. The loss of either Mr. Leonzo or Mr. Gunther would have a substantial negative effect on our company and may cause our business to fail. Neither Mr. Leonzo nor Mr. Gunther have been compensated for their services since our incorporation
 and it is highly unlikely that they will receive any compensation unless and until we generate substantial revenues. There is intense competition for skilled personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms. The loss of Mr. Leonzo&#8217; or Mr. Gunther's services could prevent us from completing the development of our plan of operation and our business. In the event of the loss of services of such personnel
 no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the services of adequate replacement personnel.



If our computer system is ineffective
 our business would be damaged

The Company&#8217;s business relies on the successful operation of the computer systems maintained at its offices. The Company&#8217;s database and other information are backed up
 and the computer system has protection against threats. However
 there is no assurance that a physical or electronic threat will not disable the company&#8217;s computer system. Such a development would represent a substantial risk to our continued operation.





















Our President
 Fernando Oswaldo Leonzo
 and our Treasurer
 Robert Gunther
 lack public company experience
 which could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as those imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Neither Mr. Leonzo nor Mr. Gunther have ever been responsible for managing a publicly traded company. Such responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis. Any such deficiencies
 weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which is necessary to maintain our public company status. If we were to fail to fulfill those obligations
 our ability to continue as a U.S. public company would be in jeopardy in which event you could lose your entire investment in our Company.

We intend to become subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934
 as amended
 which will require us to incur audit fees and legal fees in connection with the preparation of such reports. These additional costs will negatively affect our ability to earn a profit.

As of the April 15
 2014 effective date of the registration statement
 we have become required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations thereunder. In order to comply with such requirements
 our independent registered auditors will have to review our financial statements on a quarterly basis and audit our financial statements on an annual basis. Moreover
 our legal counsel will have to review and assist in the preparation of such reports. Although we believe that&#160;the approximately $10
000 we have estimated for these costs should be sufficient for the 12 month period following the completion of our offering
 the costs charged by these professionals for such services may vary significantly. Factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports cannot accurately be determined at this time and may have a major negative effect on the cost and amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys. However
 the incurrence of such costs will obviously be an expense to our operations and thus have a negative effect on our ability to meet our overhead requirements and earn a profit.

For as long as we remain an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012
 we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies&#8221; including
 but not limited to
 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation&#160;&#160;in our periodic reports and proxy statements
 and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an &#8220;emerging growth company.&#8221; We will remain an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; for up to five years
 or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion
 (ii) the date that you become a &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act
 which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter
 or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.

After
 and if ever
 we are no longer an &#8220;emerging growth company
&#8221; we expect to incur significant additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with those requirements applicable to companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies
&#8221; including Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.



We are an &#8220;emerging growth company
&#8221; as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012
 and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies

 and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result
 there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.

















We are an emerging growth company and are electing to extend our transition period for meeting new or revised accounting standards. The term &#8216;emerging growth company&#8217; means an issuer that had total annual gross revenues of less than $1
000
000
000 (as such amount is indexed for inflation every 5 years by the Commission to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
 setting the threshold to the nearest 1
000
000) during its most recently completed fiscal year. An issuer that is an emerging growth company as of the first day of that fiscal year shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of &#8211;










The last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1
000
000
000 (as such amount is indexed for inflation every 5 years by the Commission to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
 setting the threshold to the nearest 1
000
000) or more;

























The date on which such issuer has
 during the previous 3-year period
 issued more than $1
000
000
000 in non-convertible debt; or












The date on which such issuer is deemed to be a &#8216;large accelerated filer&#8217;
 as defined in section 240.12b-2 of title 17
 Code of Federal Regulations
 or any successor thereto.




As a result of being an emerging growth company
 we will be disclosing financial information that will be less complete than those of companies meeting the higher accounting standards. As such
 investors will not have access to the same level of financial disclosure as they would in companies meeting the higher accounting standards. Accordingly
 this lower level of financial disclosure may adversely affect an investor&#8217;s availability to gain an accurate view of the Company&#8217;s financial situation in order to make a fully informed investment decision. The company will base its emerging growth status at the end of the fiscal year that is five years after the first sale of shares pursuant to their registration statement.&#160; Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
 &#8220;emerging growth companies&#8221; can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies
 including
 but not limited to
 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

We will seek additional financing to initiate distribution&#160;of Hispanic and Ethnic food and beverage products. If we are unable to obtain funding when needed
 our business may not grow

We need additional capital to purchase finished goods it will distribute and to expand into new
 industry related opportunities. The Company will seek to obtain additional funds in the future.&#160; The existing operations are minimal yet still require financing. Expenditures include salaries
 rents
 warehousing expenses
 fuel costs
 phone
 and other general operating expenses associated with the intended selling and distribution of products. We define finished goods as products produced and manufactured by third parties that are ready for resell to other distributors and/or retailers directly.&#160; We will be required to fund growth through the sale of equity shares and will not be able to generate revenue if we are unsuccessful in selling such shares. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and such additional equity securities may have rights
 preferences or privileges that are senior to those of our existing common stock. Furthermore
 debt financing
 if available
 will require payment of interest and may involve restrictive covenants that could impose limitations on our operating flexibility. Our failure to successfully obtain additional future funding may jeopardize our ability to continue to grow our existing business and operations.



















If we are unable to establish and maintain relationships with our targeted customer base
 we would not be able to continue with operations

We intend to establish strong relationships with our retailer customer base by offering high quality products through a marketing plan designed to create brand loyalty. There is intense competition for these relationships and we may not be able to attract and retain these relationships in light of competitors with larger budgets and pre-existing relationships. If we cannot successfully secure these relationships
 our business would be adversely affected and any investment made into the Company could be lost in its entirety.



We are heavily dependent on the personal efforts
 experience and abilities of our Officers and Directors. They have been and continue to expect to be able to commit full time to the continuing development of the Company&#8217;s business plan. The loss or unavailability of their services would have a materially adverse effect on our business prospects and potential earning capacity. We do not currently carry any insurance to compensate for any such loss.

As a result of becoming a reporting company
 our expenses will increase significantly

As a result of becoming a reporting company whose shares are registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933
 as amended
 our ongoing expenses are expected to increase significantly
 including expenses in compensation to our officer
 ongoing public company expenses
 including increased legal
 accounting expenses as a result of our status as a reporting company
 and expenses incurred in complying with the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These increased expenses may negatively impact our ability to become profitable.



The Company is entering a market that already has other companies distributing products in the respective category.&#160;Hispanic food and beverages appeal to Hispanics
 as well as non-Hispanics
 however tastes are subject to change among any ethnicity and such changes may or may not be short-term. Changes to the general economy or changes within the product category may adversely affect the performance of your investment.



We are controlled by current officers
 directors and principal stockholders

Our officers and directors and principal founding stockholders beneficially own approximately 46.4% of the outstanding shares of our common stock
 as of May 31
 2014. There are 5.2 million common shares beneficially owned by officers and directors.&#160; If the full amount of common shares offered through this registration statement is subscribed for
 our officers and directors and founding shareholders would control over 46% of the issued and outstanding common stock. In addition
 our controlling shareholders have 1 million shares of&#160;Series A preferred shares which provide 50 votes per share on all corporate actions. So long as our officers and directors and principal founding stockholders control a majority of our fully diluted equity
 they will continue to have the ability to elect our directors and determine the outcome of votes by our stockholders on corporate matters
 including mergers
 sales of all or substantially all of our assets
 charter amendments and other matters requiring stockholder approval. This controlling interest may have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock by discouraging third-party investors.

If you purchased shares in the offering
 you experienced immediate and substantial dilution

The $0.25 per share offering price of the common stock that was sold under the April 15
 2014 prospectus was arbitrarily set. The price does not bear any relationship to our assets
 book value
 earnings or net worth and it is not an indication of actual value. Accordingly
 if you purchased shares in this offering
 you experienced immediate and substantial dilution. The net tangible book value per share pre-offering was $0.00458
 and this increased to $0.00468 from 65
200 shares being sold in the offering during fiscal year 2014.&#160;Investors experienced immediate dilution of $0.2453 from the $0.25 share price.&#160;Investors may also suffer additional dilution in the future from the sale of additional shares of common stock or other securities.&#160;





















The shares outstanding are not actively traded. Purchasers of the shares must therefore be prepared to hold their investment and bear the economic risk of the entire loss of their investment if we fail to make a profit.&#160;Prior to the offering there has not been a public market for our common stock
 and there can be no assurance that an active public market for the common stock will develop or be sustained after the offering.&#160;As such
 you may find it difficult to liquidate your investment. The offering price of the shares has been determined arbitrarily based on several factors and may not be indicative of future market prices. If our stock is traded in a public market at some future date
 it could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results
 announcement of new claims of our competitors
 and other events or factors. In addition
 in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have had a substantial effect on the market prices for many emerging growth companies
 which may be unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies.

The Company intends to seek out a market maker to apply to have its common stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board under the ticker symbol HISP. &#160;However
 there can be no assurance that our shares of common stock will be quoted by a market maker on the OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB).&#160;Until there is an established trading market
 holders of our common stock may find it difficult to sell their stock or to obtain accurate quotations for the price of the common stock. If a market for our common stock does develop
 our stock price may be volatile.

Even if a market develops for our shares
 our shares may be thinly traded with wide share price fluctuations
 low share process and minimal liquidity.

If a market for our shares develops
 the share price may be volatile with wide fluctuations in response to several factors
 including:









In addition
 if our shares are quoted on the OTCBB
 our share price may be affected by factors that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. Our share price might be affected by general economic
 political
 and market conditions
 such as recessions
 interest rates
 or international currency fluctuations. In addition
 even if our stock is approved for quotation by a market maker through the OTCBB
 stocks traded over this quotation system are usually thinly traded
 highly volatile and not followed by analysts. These factors
 which are not under our control
 may have a material effect on our share price.



Rules 15g-1 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended
 impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who make a market in &#8220;penny stocks.&#8221; A penny stock generally includes any non-Nasdaq equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share. Our shares currently are not traded on Nasdaq nor on any other exchange nor are they quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board.&#160; Following the date that the registration statement
 in which this prospectus is included
 becomes effective we hope to find a broker-dealer to act as a market maker for our stock and file on our behalf with FINRA an application on Form 211 for approval for our shares to be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. As of the date of this prospectus
 we have not attempted to find a market maker to file such application for us. If we are successful in finding such a market maker and successful in applying for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board
 it is very likely that our stock will be considered a &#8220;penny stock.&#8221; In that case
 purchases and sales of our shares will be generally facilitated by FINRA broker-dealers who act as market makers for our shares. The additional sales practice and disclosure requirements imposed upon broker-dealers may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our shares
 which could severely limit the market liquidity of the shares and impede the sale of our shares in the secondary market.



















Under the penny stock regulations
 a broker-dealer selling penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or &#8220;accredited investor&#8221; (generally
 an individual with net worth in excess of $5
000
000 or an annual income exceeding $200
000
 or $300
000 together with his or her spouse) must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must receive the purchaser&#8217;s written consent to the transaction prior to sale
 unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt.

In addition
 the penny stock regulations require the broker-dealer to deliver
 prior to any transaction involving a penny stock
 a disclosure schedule prepared by the Commission relating to the penny stock market
 unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. A broker-dealer is also required to disclose commissions payable to the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally
 a broker-dealer is required to send monthly statements disclosing recent price information with respect to the penny stock held in a customer&#8217;s account and information with respect to the limited market in penny stocks.&#160;Broker-dealers are discouraged from effecting transactions with penny stocks like Hispanica International Delights of America (OTC BB: HISP).



We have not declared or paid any dividends on our common stock since our inception
 and we do not anticipate paying any such dividends for the foreseeable future. Investors that need to rely on dividend income should not invest in our common stock
 as any income would only come from any rise in the market price of our common stock
 which is uncertain and unpredictable. Investors that require liquidity should also not invest in our common stock. There is no established trading market and should one develop
 it will likely be volatile and subject to minimal trading volumes.

Because we can issue additional shares of common stock
 purchasers of our common stock may incur immediate dilution and may experience further dilution.

We are authorized to issue up to 100
000
000 shares of common stock and 10
000
000 shares of preferred stock. As of August 25
 2014
 there were 11
240
700 issued and outstanding shares of common stock
 and 11
202
700 as of the end of the fiscal year May 31
 2014. Our Board of Directors has the authority to cause us to issue additional shares of common stock without consent of any of our shareholders. Consequently
 the shareholders may experience more dilution in their ownership of our Company in the future
 which could have an adverse effect on the trading market for our common shares.



Our articles of incorporation authorize us to issue up to 10
000
000 shares of preferred stock. Accordingly
 our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred shares
 as well as the authority to issue such shares
 without further shareholder approval. As a result
 our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders preferred rights to our assets upon liquidation
 the right to receive dividends before dividends are declared to holders of our common stock
 and the right to the redemption of such preferred shares
 together with a premium
 prior to the redemption of the common stock. To the extent that we do issue such additional shares of preferred stock
 your rights as holders of common stock could be impaired thereby
 including
 without limitation
 dilution of your ownership interests in us. In addition
 shares of preferred stock could be issued with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control or make removal of management more difficult
 which may not be in your interest as holders of common stock.


















Anti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Delaware state law hinder a potential takeover of Hispanica International Delights of America
 Inc.

We may be subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (&#8220;DGCL&#8221;)
 an anti-takeover statute. In general
 Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a &#8220;business combination&#8221; with an &#8220;interested shareholder&#8221; for a period of three years following the time the person became an interested shareholder
 unless the business combination or the acquisition of shares that resulted in a shareholder becoming an interested shareholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Generally
 a &#8220;business combination&#8221; includes a merger
 asset or stock sale
 or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested shareholder. Generally
 an &#8220;interested shareholder&#8221; is a person who
 together with affiliates and associates
 owns (or within three years prior to the determination of interested shareholder status did own) 15% or more of a corporation&#8217;s voting stock. The existence of this provision would be expected to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors
 including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of common stock held by our shareholders.

For purposes of Delaware law
 an &#8220;interested shareholder&#8221; is any person who that (i) is the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation
 or (ii) is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and was the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation at any time within the 3-year period immediately prior to the date on which it is sought to be determined whether such person is an interested shareholder
 and the affiliates and associates of such person; provided
 however
 that the term &#8220;interested shareholder&#8221; shall not include (x) any person who (A) owned shares in excess of the 15% limitation set forth herein as of
 or acquired such shares pursuant to a tender offer commenced prior to
 December 23
 1987
 or pursuant to an exchange offer announced prior to the aforesaid date and commenced within 90 days thereafter and either (I) continued to own shares in excess of such 15% limitation or would have but for action by the corporation or (II) is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and so continued (or so would have continued but for action by the corporation) to be the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation at any time within the 3-year period immediately prior to the date on which it is sought to be determined whether such a person is an interested shareholder or (B) acquired said shares from a person described in item (A) of this paragraph by gift
 inheritance or in a transaction in which no consideration was exchanged; or (y) any person whose ownership of shares in excess of the 15% limitation set forth herein is the result of action taken solely by the corporation; provided that such person shall be an interested shareholder if thereafter such person acquires additional shares of voting stock of the corporation
 except as a result of further corporate action not caused
 directly or indirectly
 by such person. For the purpose of determining whether a person is an interested shareholder
 the voting stock of the corporation deemed to be outstanding shall include stock deemed to be owned by the person through (i) Beneficially owns such stock
 directly or indirectly; or (ii) Has (A) the right to acquire such stock (whether such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time) pursuant to any agreement
 arrangement or understanding
 or upon the exercise of conversion rights
 exchange rights
 warrants or options
 or otherwise; provided
 however
 that a person shall not be deemed the owner of stock tendered pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made by such person or any of such person&#8217;s affiliates or associates until such tendered stock is accepted for purchase or exchange; or (B) the right to vote such stock pursuant to any agreement
 arrangement or understanding; provided
 however
 that a person shall not be deemed the owner of any stock because of such person&#8217;s right to vote such stock if the agreement
 arrangement or understanding to vote such stock arises solely from a revocable proxy or consent given in response to a proxy or consent solicitation made to 10 or more persons; or (iii) Has any agreement
 arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring
 holding
 voting
 or disposing of such stock with any other person that beneficially owns
 or whose affiliates or associates beneficially own
 directly or indirectly
 such stock.

240
700 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding held by 47 shareholders of record.



The Company has never declared any cash dividends with respect to its Common Stock. Future payment of dividends is within the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on earnings
 capital requirements
 financial condition and other relevant factors. Although there are no material restrictions limiting or that are likely to limit
 the Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on its Common Stock
 the Company presently intends to retain future earnings
 if any
 for use in the business and has no present intention to pay cash dividends on its Common Stock.

Our Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&#8220;MD&amp;A&#8221;) is provided in addition to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations
 financial condition and cash flows. MD&amp;A is organized as follows:







































Results of Operations &#8212; Analysis of our financial results comparing the year ended May 31
 2014 to 2013. Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8212; Analysis of changes in our cash flows
 and discussion of our financial condition and potential sources of liquidity.




This report includes a number of forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance.&#160;&#160;Forward looking statements are often identified by words like: believe
 expect
 estimate
 anticipate
 intend
 project and similar expressions
 or words which
 by their nature
 refer to future events.&#160;&#160;You should not place undue certainty on these forward looking statements
 which apply only as of the date of this annual report.&#160;&#160;These forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions.



We have prepared our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
 which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. We base these significant judgments and estimates on historical experience and other applicable assumptions we believe to be reasonable based upon information presently available. These estimates may change as new events occur
 as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the financial statements as soon as they became known. Actual results could materially differ from our estimates under different assumptions
 judgments or conditions.

All of our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 to our financial statements
 included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We have identified the following as our critical accounting policies and estimates
 which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties
 are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions
 judgments or conditions.





&#8212; ASC Topic 718
&#8221; prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all stock-based compensation plans
 including employee stock options
 restricted stock
 employee stock purchase plans and stock appreciation rights.


ASC Topic 718 requires employee compensation expense to be recorded using the fair value method. The Company accounts for employee stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718. For non-employee options and warrants
 the company uses the fair value method as prescribed in ASC Topic 718.

Determining the appropriate fair value of the stock-based compensation requires the input of subjective assumptions
 including the expected life of the stock-based payment and stock price volatility. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing option model to value its stock option awards which incorporate the Company&#8217;s stock price
 volatility
 U.S. risk-free rate
 dividend rate
 and estimated life.




















&#8212; Our short-term financial instruments
 including cash
 accounts payable and other liabilities
 consist primarily of instruments without extended maturities. We believe that the fair values of our current assets and current liabilities approximate their reported carrying amounts.



Recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force)
 the AICPA
 and the SEC
 did not
 or are not believed by management
 to have a material impact on the Company's present or future financial statements.&#160;



Years Ended May 31
 2014 and 2013


The Company commenced distribution of Gran Nevada in March 2014 in Deleware
 Maryland
 Virginia
 Pennsylvania
 New York
 Texas and California.&#160;&#160;The eight products distributed from Gran Nevada (http://www.grannevadabeverage.com) are believed to be the only all natural
 not from concentrate
 preservative-free brand of aguas frescas (Mexican Horchata
 Horchata de Morro
 Tamarindo
 Hibiscus
 Mango
 Guava
 Pineapple
 and Limeade) available in the United States today. Revenues from its eight products for the year ended May 31
 2014 were $101
781. The Company had no revenues for the year ended May 31
 2013.


Cost of Revenues includes production costs and raw material costs.&#160;&#160;For the year ended May 31
 2014
 cost of revenues was $128
885
 or 127% of sales.


For the year ended May 31
 2014
 operating expenses were $148
217
 an increase of $121
967 or 465% over operating expenses for the year ended May 31
 2013 of $26
250.&#160;&#160;This increase was primarily the result of 2013 being a stub year only consisting of 45 days of operations. If 2013 operating expenses were annualized
 it would be about $212
917
 which is higher than 2014 due to the startup costs in 2013. Nevertheless
 HISP continues to incur costs associated with launching commercial operations in the year ended May 31
 2014. The expenses consisted primarily of&#160;&#160;increases in (a) advisory service fees and consulting fees
 which were $137

 2014 as compared to $25
250 during the year ended May 31

000 during the year ended May 31
 2013.





During the year ended May 31
 2014
 the Company received cash proceeds of $70
060 as a result of the Company&#8217;s sale of common stock in the first quarter and the last month of the fiscal year ending May 31
 2014.&#160;&#160;The aggregate amount realized from stockholder contributions was $6000.&#160;The Company utilized the majority of these funds for operations and preparation for its first distribution runs
 as well as to promote and market the business.&#160;&#160;Additionally
 the Company used some of the funds for administrative costs
 including legal fees
 audit fees and compensation costs.

Subsequent to the year ended May 31
 2014
 the Company received additional cash proceeds of $9
500 from the sale of Common Stock. See Note 10 to the&#160;Financial Statements for additional information about this transaction.




















As a result of the financing in May 2014
 the Company believes it has sufficient cash to fund the operations of the Company through August.&#160;&#160;Our business prospects are difficult to predict
 however
 due to our limited operating history.&#160;&#160;&#160;Our auditors have included an explanatory paragraph in their report on our consolidated financial statements relating to the uncertainty of our business as a going concern
 due to our limited operating history and our lack of historical profitability.





















Disclosure controls and procedures include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management
 including its principal executive and principal financial officers
 or persons performing similar functions
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
 and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions
 regardless of how remote.


Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company&#8217;s senior management
 consisting of&#160;&#160;the Company&#8217;s principal executive and financial officer and the Company&#8217;s principal accounting officer
 the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures
 as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report (the &#8220;Evaluation Date&#8221;). Based on this evaluation
 the Company&#8217;s principal executive and financial officer and the Company&#8217;s principal accounting officer concluded
 as of the Evaluation Date
 that the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.




The management of Hispanica International Delights of America
 Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act.&#160;Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations
 internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore
 even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. In evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
. Based on this evaluation
 our officers concluded that
 during the period covered by this annual report
 our internal controls over financial reporting were operating effectively.


















As previously reported
 the Company does not have an audit committee and is not currently obligated to have one. Although it remains management&#8217;s view that such a committee is an important internal control over financial reporting
 management does not believe that the lack of an audit committee could result in a material misstatement in the Company&#8217;s financial statements in the near future. Accordingly
 management has concluded that this deficiency alone does not constitute a material weakness in the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting
 and has considered the foregoing in its determination that the Company&#8217;s internal controls over financial reporting and its disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the Evaluation Date.










There was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during the year ended May 31
 2014 that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal controls over financial reporting.

.&#160;&#160;CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
 AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE




The Chairman &amp; CEO of HISP
 Mr. Fernando &#8220;Oswaldo&#8221; Leonzo
 owns no shares in GN but is GN&#8217;s current President.&#160; Mr. Leonzo owns 34% of HISP consisting of 3
800
000 common shares for which he paid $7
000 or $0.002 per share and 600
000 preferred shares valued at $600 which he received for services rendered to the Company. The ownership of GN is as follows: 70% by Olympic Beverage
 LLC (solely owned and controlled by Mr. Jose Fidel Cabrera Escobar)
 12% Robert Gunther
 16% among four other individuals. Of these individuals only Mr. Gunther owns 8% in HISP consisting of 900
000 common shares for which he paid $1
200 or $0.002&#160;per share and 300
000 preferred shares valued at $300 which he received for services rendered to the Company. The financial statements of GN are not included because the sole controlling owner (Mr. Jose Fidel Cabrera) has declined to submit them since he has no stake or shares in HISP and&#160;wishes to keep his company GN private. GN will continue to sell its products to some of its customer base- primarily Ethnic Food Distributors in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S. As a result of Mr. Cabrera&#8217;s refusal to permit the GN financials to be included
 the Licensing Agreement with GN was terminated and replaced with a non-exclusive Distribution Agreement. All revisions to our S1
 as well as our financial statements
 reflect this change in the relationship. In regards to the differences in the &#8220;expected&#8221; revenues generated from our company versus what GN was generating before:&#160;HISP expects to sell to a different customer base than the existing GN customer base.&#160;&#160;As per the terms of the &#8220;Distribution Agreement&#8221; (please see exhibit) HISP has the right to distribute other products and GN in turn has the right to sell to other customers. There was also a short term Promissory Note dated May 23
 2013 for the amount of $7
500 from GN with an annual interest rate of 3% and due on August 31
 2013
 which was paid back in full by HISP on June 14
 2013 (Note 5). As of this date HISP does not owe any monies to GN. The Chief Legal Officer and Director of HISP
 attorney Jerry Gruenbaum
 owns no shares in GN nor is he affiliated with GN in any capacity
 owns 4% in HISP consisting of 500
000&#160;common shares for which he paid $400 or $0.002&#160;per share and 100
000 preferred shares valued at $100 which he received for services rendered to the Company.


The Company currently leases its offices on a month to month basis from the Mr. Fernando Oswaldo Leonzo for $500 per month&#160;(Note 7). The current officers and directors of the Company are involved in other business activities and may
 in the future
 become involved in additional business opportunities. There are no contracts
 options
 warrants
 rights
 licensing agreements
 employment agreements or any other agreements of any kind between HISP and any of its current officers and directors.&#160; If a specific business opportunity becomes available
 such person may face a conflict in selecting between our business interest and their other business interests. The policy of the Board is that any personal business or corpora opportunity incurred by an officer or director of HISP must be examined by the Board and turned down by the Board in a timely basis before an officer or director can engage or take advantage of a business opportunity which could result in a conflict of interest.


The founder's Common Shares as disclosed herein were sold to our officers and directors in April 2013. The Company believes that the issuance of these shares was exempt from registration pursuant to Section (2) of the Securities Act of 1933
 as amended
 as a transaction by an issuer not involving any public offering. The Founders
 Fernando &#8220;Oswaldo&#8221; Leonzo (Chairman &amp; CEO)
 Robert Gunther (Treasurer
 Director &amp; Chief Operations Officer)
 and Jerry Gruenbaum (Secretary and Director) were issued the following Preferred Shares as founders for services rendered as Officers and Directors as of April 30
 2013
 600
000 Preferred Shares
 300
000 Preferred Shares
 and 100
000 Preferred Shares respectively. &#160; None of the following parties has
 since the date of incorporation
 had any material interest
 direct or indirect
 in any transaction with the Company or in any presently proposed transaction that has or will materially affect us:








&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Any person who beneficially owns
 directly or indirectly
 shares carrying more than 5% of the voting rights attached to the outstanding shares of common stock;
























We are not currently subject to listing requirements of any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system which has requirements that a majority of the board of directors be &#8220;independent&#8221; and
 as a result
 we are not at this time required to (and we do not) have our Board of Directors comprised of a majority of &#8220;Independent Directors.&#8221;

Our Board of Directors has considered the independence of its directors in reference to the definition of &#8220;independent director&#8221; established by the Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5605(a)(2). In doing so
 the Board of Directors has reviewed all commercial and other relationships of each director in making its determination as to the independence of its directors. After such review
 the Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Devlin and Mr. Spinner qualify as independent under the requirements of the Nasdaq listing standards.







As of July 2013

Hispanica International Delights of America
 Inc.





We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Hispanica International Delights of America
 Inc.
 (A Development Stage Company) as of May 31
 2014 and 2013
 and the related statements of operations
 stockholders' (deficit) and cash flows for the years then ended
 and the period from inception (April 15
 2013) to May 31
 2014.&#160;&#160;These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.&#160;&#160;Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.





We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining
 on a test basis
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates by management
 as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.





In our opinion
 the financial statements referred to above present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of Hispanica International Delights of America
 Inc.
 (A Development Stage Company) as of May 31
 2014 and 2013
 and results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended
 and for the period from inception (April 15
 2013) to May 31
 2014
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.





The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 9 to the financial statements
 the Company has suffered a loss from operations and is in the development stage. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to this matter are also discussed in Note 9. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

May 31
 2014 and 2013

















































Hispanica International Delights of America
 Inc. (HIDA or the Company) was incorporated in Delaware in April 2013.&#160;&#160;The Company has been in the development stage since inception and has not generated any sales to date.&#160;&#160;The Company plans to market traditional Hispanic and ethnic food packaged products and will license and/or acquire existing brands and distributors of Hispanic products.























In general
 the Company records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
 services have been rendered or product delivery has occurred
 the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable
 and collectability is reasonably assured. The following policies reflect specific criteria for the various revenues streams of the Company:






























































The Company follows Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 280
 Segment Reporting.&#160;&#160;The Company currently operates in a single segment and will evaluate additional segment disclosure requirements as it expands its operations.






















Basic net (loss) income per common share is calculated using the weighted average common shares outstanding during each reporting period.&#160;&#160;Diluted net (loss) income per common share adjusts the weighted average common shares for the potential dilution that could occur if common stock equivalents (convertible debt and preferred stock
 warrants
 stock options and restricted stock shares and units) were exercised or converted into common stock.&#160;&#160;There were no common stock equivalents at May 31
 2014.

Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences related to temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes at each year end
 based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.&#160;&#160;A valuation allowance is recognized when
 based on the weight of all available evidence
 it is considered more likely than not that all
 or some portion
 of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.&#160;&#160;Income tax expense is the sum of current income tax plus the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.













ASC 740
 Income Taxes
 requires a company to first determine whether it is more likely than not (which is defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date
 assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information.&#160;&#160;A tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.






















The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to employees in accordance with ASC 718
 Compensation - Stock Compensation.&#160;&#160;ASC 718 requires all share-based compensation payments to be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value using an option pricing model.&#160;&#160;ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.













Equity instruments granted to non-employees are accounted for in accordance with ASC 505
 Equity.&#160;&#160;The final measurement date for the fair value of equity instruments with performance criteria is the date that each performance commitment for such equity instrument is satisfied or there is a significant disincentive for non-performance.























The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.&#160;&#160;Cash equivalents consisted of money market funds.&#160;&#160;At May 31
 2014
 the Company had cash equivalents of $1
544.

The Company extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business and performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers
 maintaining an allowance for potential credit losses.&#160;&#160;Accounts receivable is reported net of the allowance for doubtful accounts.&#160;&#160;The allowance is based on management's estimate of the amount of receivables that will actually be collected.

























Inventory consists of raw materials and finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost (first-in
 first-out) or market value.






















Pursuant to&#160;ASC No. 820. Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, the Company is required to estimate the fair value of all financial instruments included on its balance sheet as of February 28
 2014. The Company's financial instruments consist of cash. The Company considers the carrying value of such amounts in the financial statements to approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments.
































































During the year ended May 31
 2014
 sales to two customers accounted for approximately 73% of the Company's net sales or approximately $101
000.&#160;&#160;Additionally
 one of these customers accounted for approximately 64% of the Company's accounts receivable balance at May 31
 2014
 or approximately $34

 Income Taxes
 requires a company to first determine&#13;whether it is more likely than not (which is defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained&#13;based on its technical merits as of the reporting date
 assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full&#13;knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized&#13;at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing&#13;authority.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 12pt/normal Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 12pt/normal Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stock-Based Compensation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 12pt/normal Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;p style=font: 12pt/normal Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0&gt;The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to employees&#13;in accordance with ASC 718
 Compensation - Stock Compensation. ASC 718 requires all share-based compensation payments to be recognized&#13;in the financial statements based on the fair value using an option pricing model.

 Inc. (&#34;HIDA&#34;
or the &#34;Company&#34;) was incorporated in Delaware in April 2013. The Company has been in the development stage since inception
and has not generated any sales to date. The Company plans to market traditional Hispanic and ethnic food packaged products and

revenues streams of the Company:

the weighted average common shares outstanding during each reporting period. Diluted net (loss) income per common share adjusts
the weighted average common shares for the potential dilution that could occur if common stock equivalents (convertible debt and

amounts used for tax purposes at each year end

 based on the weight of all
available evidence
 it is considered more likely than not that all
 or some portion
 of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Income tax expense is the sum of current income tax plus the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.


 Income Taxes
 requires a company to first determine
whether it is more likely than not (which is defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained
based on its technical merits as of the reporting date
 assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full
knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized
at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing
authority.

 Compensation - Stock Compensation. ASC 718 requires all share-based compensation payments to be recognized
in the financial statements based on the fair value using an option pricing model. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated

 services or the rights to use assets) the disclosure may indicate the accounting policy for each unit of accounting as well as how units of accounting are determined and valued. The disclosure may encompass important judgment as to appropriateness of principles related to recognition of revenue. The disclosure also may indicate the entity's treatment of any unearned or deferred revenue that arises from the transaction.
