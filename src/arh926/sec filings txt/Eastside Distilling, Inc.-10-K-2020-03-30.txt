 actual results could materially
differ from past results and/or those anticipated
 estimated or projected.

We

 whether as a result of new information
future events or otherwise. You should

 consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the United States

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
&rdquo; we present the reasons we use these measures
under the heading of &ldquo;Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Operating
as a small business in a large
 international spirits marketplace occupied by large multi-national conglomerates
 we seek to utilize
our size and our public company stature to our advantage and position Eastside Distilling as a leading tier 2 spirits provider
by acquiring and developing brands
 growing them to a national presence and positioning them for sale to the tier 1 suppliers
to the market. This strategy was demonstrated by the launch of our Redneck Riviera Brand (RRW) in conjunction with our branding
partners
 Sandstrom Partners in 2018. This demonstrated how our team can leverage its position to launch nascent or new brands
and grow them more quickly than the tier 1 larger conglomerates because we are able to focus and dedicate more of our attention
to developing innovative products. Our RRW brand went from idea
 to market roll-out in less than nine months and achieved national
distribution in 49 states in 18 months. In September 2019
 we acquired the Azu&ntilde;ia tequila brand and have begun to distribute
this brand through our national platform.

In
May 2017
 we used our shares to acquire 90% of Big Bottom Distilling
 LLC (&ldquo;BBD&rdquo;)
 known for its award-winning
 super-premium
gins and whiskeys
 and American Single Malt Whiskey. BBD&rsquo;s super-premium spirits give us a presence at the &ldquo;ultra-premium
segment&rdquo; of the market. In December 2018
 we acquired the remaining 10% of BBD. In September 2019
 we also acquired the
high-end
 luxury tequila brand
 Azu&ntilde;ia
 to complement our portfolio and provide us with a larger established brand in the
high-growth tequila category. In addition
 through MotherLode Craft Distillery (&ldquo;MotherLode&rdquo;)
 our wholly owned subsidiary
acquired in March 2017 and Craft Canning + Bottling
 LLC (formerly known as Craft Canning
 LLC) (&ldquo;Craft Canning&rdquo;)
which we acquired in January 2019
 we provide contract bottling
 canning
 and packaging services for existing and emerging beer
wine and spirits producers. We have used our mobile canning operations to profit from the rapid growth in
the canned beverages industry (beer
 wine
 spirit-based RTD&rsquo;s).


    
    



Market
Opportunity

Large
and Growing Global and Domestic Markets

The
global spirits market is very large and according to Statista
 a leading business data platform
 the spirit market generates total
revenues in excess of $400 billion annually
 growing at a moderate estimated rate of 2-4% annually.

According
to the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S. (DISCUS)
 distilled spirits sales in the U.S. were up 5.3% in 2019
 increasing by
$1.5 billion
 to a new record of $29 billion. Key spirits category drivers of sales growth in 2019 included: American whiskey
up 10.8 % or $387 million to $4 billion; rye was an important component of the overall American whiskey category growth with sales
up 14.7 % or $30 million
 reaching $235 million; tequila/mezcal
 up 12.4 % or $372 million to $3.4 billion; mezcal surpassed $100
million in sales for the first time totaling $105 million. Pre-mixed cocktails were up 7.5 % or $25 million to $351 million. Volumes
rose by 3.3% to a record 239 million cases
 an increase of 7.6 million cases from 2018. The trend underscored the decades long
trend in market premiumization as consumers shifted their purchases toward more expensive spirits
 resulting in a faster rate
of growth in revenue over the rate of growth in physical shipments. According to DISCUS
 in 2019
 the spirits industry again gained
market share over beer and wine sales. Revenues grew by half a percent to 37.8% of the total beverage alcohol market. This was
the 10th year of market share gains for the spirits industry. Each percentage point gain in market share is worth $770 million
in additional revenue to the industry.

Key
Growth Trends that We Target

High-End
and Super-Premium
 across most categories
 exhibited strong growth
trends in 2019. The 2019 revenues for those price points increased 7.6% and 7.9%
 respectively
 and by 8.0% and 7.0% in volume.

Millennials

 &ldquo;Millennials&rdquo; (individuals born between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s) value &ldquo;authenticity&rdquo;
and are inspired by travel and like to try new products and seek new experiences
 according to a survey by BeverageDaily.com.
Millennials tend to drink a broader range of spirit types (vodka
 rum
 tequila
 whiskey
 gin) than prior generations
 and Millennials
consume more expensive spirits than their predecessors. These individuals are often attracted to vintage spirits and cocktails
with nostalgic followings
 such as throwbacks to the 1950s like rye whiskey
 bourbon and the Manhattan cocktail. According to
Barclays Research
 millennials increasingly prefer spirits over beer and wine
 and flavored spirits in particular. In addition
according to DISCUS
 millennials are more willing than prior generations to purchase premium spirits and continue to gravitate
toward high-end and super premium spirits.

Our
Strategy

Our
overall strategy is to become a &ldquo;house of brands&rdquo; that is designed to drive industry leading growth at the tier 2
level and shareholder value by acquiring nascent brands
 rebranding them with the services of Sandstrom Partners and introducing
those brands to the market on our national distribution platform. We aim to grow our brands to be an attractive acquisition candidate
for the tier 1 producers in the spirits industry and ultimately sell those brands and use the proceeds of the brand sales to duplicate
the process.

Our
goal is to have brand representation in all classes of spirits and Ready-to-Drink (RTD) beverages
 and distribution
channels in both spirits and beer that crosses all classes of trade primarily focused on the off-premise trade.

To
help achieve our strategy
 we are focused on:



    
    
Identifying
    and completing strategic brand development in-house and acquisitions that fill out our product portfolio and/or our
    distribution strategy;

    
    
    

    
    
Achieving
    world-class spirit rebranding with the collaboration of Sandstrom Partners;

    
    
    

    
    
Achieving
    brand penetration through our national distribution platform;




    
    





    
    
maximizing
    our margins through targeted cost leverage utilizing both in-house and outsourced production strategies;

    
    
    

    
    
monetizing
    our diverse and growing branded-product portfolio through brand sales; and

    
    
    

    
    
building
this process into a system whereby we can repeat the above
    process to the benefit of its shareholders.

    
    
    

Our
Strengths

We
believe the following competitive strengths will help enable the implementation of our growth strategies:



    
    
Award-Winning
    Diverse Product Line
 currently offering over twenty premium craft spirit brands
 many
    of which have won awards for taste and/or product design. According to a study by the American Craft Spirits Association
    the U.S. craft spirits volume of cases sold experienced a compound annual growth rate of over 25% between 2010 and 2017 and
    saw an increase in market share from 0.8% to 3.2% during that period. Our sales of premium brands have increased over 1
000%
    since 2010. We believe our diverse
 recognized product line in this growing market will enable us to establish a presence
    in new geographic markets and enable us to procure additional distributors for our products.

    
    
    

    
    
Experienced
    Distilling and Blending Experts:
 with highly regarded &ldquo;palates&rdquo;
    and experience is important to us maintaining a high-quality
 artisanal character to our products as well as adding to our
    consumer appeal.

    
    
    

    
    
Experienced
    Marketing and Branding:
 an internationally known spirit branding firm
    provides us with strong expertise and capabilities with respect to marketing and branding
 a critical element in a large consumer
    market
 such as spirits.

    
    
    

    
    
Key
    Distribution Relationships: 
    in the United States
 such as RNDC and Young&rsquo;s Market. We have also engaged Park Street
 a provider of back-office administrative
    and logistical services for alcohol and beverage distributors
 in order to keep our overhead low by managing our shipping
    and logistics to the market. We believe these relationships will help accomplish our goal of having our premium spirits
    sold and distributed nationwide.

    
    
    

    
    
Expanded
) acquisition of Craft Canning along with our substantial investments
    already made during 2017 and 2018
 we believe that our production capabilities have been significantly enhanced to support
    both our Eastside branded products as well as our private-label operations.

    
    
    

    
    
Outsourced
    Production for High Volume Brands: 
    to our in-house production capabilities
 we will look to outsource our production to lower our cost of goods.


Our
Product Approach

Our
approach to our craft spirits involves five important aspects:



    
    
Commitment
    to Quality
 innovative products targeted at growing markets.

    
    
    

    
    
Authentic
    Yet Scalable:
    at scale
 while keeping flavor profiles consistent.

    
    
    

    
    
Unique
    Talent and Experience



    
    





    
    
Extensive
    Spirit Portfolio
    which we believe affords us the opportunity to target a broader range of consumers with our brands.

    
    
    

    
    
Generate
    Customer Loyalty


Production
and Supply

We
achieve various complex flavor profiles through one or more of the following techniques: infusion of fruit
 addition of various
natural flavoring substances
 and
 in the case of rums and whiskeys
 aging of the brands in various types of casks for extended
periods of time
 as well as the blending of several rums or whiskeys to achieve a unique flavor profile for each brand. After
we complete the distillation
 purification and flavoring processes
 we bottle or can the various liquids. This involves
several important stages
 including bottle and label design and procurement
 filling of the bottles and packaging the bottles
in various configurations for shipment.

We
rely on a limited number of suppliers for the sourcing of our spirit products and raw materials
 including our distillate products
and other ingredients. These suppliers consist of third-party producers in the U.S and Mexico. Other than our 20-year exclusive
agreement with Agaveros Unidos de Amatitan
 SA. de CV.
 we do not have long-term
 written agreements with any of our suppliers.
However
 we believe that we have consistent and reliable third-party sources for the needed materials. We produce and bottle all
our spirits for distribution
 regardless of whether the distillation phase of the process was at our facility or at one of our
suppliers. During 2018 and 2019
 we procured a significant portion of our outside base distillate from MGP Ingredients and we
intend to continue to actively rely on this supplier.

As
of September 12
 2019
 in conjunction with the acquisition of the Azu&ntilde;ia tequila brand
 we assumed the 20-year exclusive
purchase agreement with Agaveros Unidos de Amatitan
 SA. de CV. The exclusivity is based on minimum purchase volumes
 fixed
pricing for each of different presentations of tequila and specific cash terms.

Distribution
Network

Since
2018 with the introduction of Redneck Riviera Whiskey
 we developed a national distribution network and currently have distribution
and brokerage relationships with third-party distributors in 49 U.S. states.

U.S.
Distribution

Producers
and importers of beverage alcohol in the United States must sell their products through a three-tier distribution system.
Typically
 a brand is first sold to a network of distributors
 or wholesalers
 covering the United States
 in either &ldquo;open&rdquo;
states or &ldquo;control&rdquo; states. In the 33 open states
 the distributors are generally large
 privately-held companies.
In the 17 control states
 the states themselves function as the distributor
 and regulate suppliers
 including our company.
The distributors and wholesalers in turn sell to individual retailers
 such as liquor stores
 restaurants
 bars
 supermarkets
and other outlets licensed to sell alcoholic beverages. In larger states
 such as New York
 more than one distributor may handle
a brand in separate geographical areas. In control states
 importers sell their products directly to state liquor authorities
which distribute the products and either operate retail outlets or license the retail sales function to private companies
 while
maintaining strict control over pricing and profit.

The
U.S. spirits industry has consolidated dramatically over the last ten years due to merger and acquisition activity. Eight major
spirits companies currently dominate the industry
 each of which owns and operates its own importing businesses. All companies
including these large companies
 are required by law to sell their products through wholesale distributors in the United States.
The major companies continue to exert increasing influence over the regional distributors and as a result
 it has become increasingly
difficult for smaller companies to get their products recognized by distributors.


    
    





We
hold the federal importer and wholesaler license required by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the U.S. Treasury
Department and the requisite state licenses within the states we conduct business.

Our
inventory is maintained in offsite bonded warehouses at our producers
 our bonded warehouses in Milwaukie
 Oregon and Hillsboro
Oregon and at  bonded warehouses managed by Park Street
 our fulfillment and logistics partner. We
also typically have inventory in transit that we ship nationally by our network of licensed and bonded carriers.

Wholesalers
and Distributors

In
the United States
 we are required by law to use state-licensed distributors or
 in the control states
 state-owned agencies performing
this function
 to sell our brands to retail outlets. As a result
 we depend on distributors for sales
 product placement and retail
store penetration. All of the distributors that we currently work with also distribute our competitors&rsquo; products and brands.
As a result
 we must foster and maintain our relationships with our distributors. Through our internal sales team
 we have established
relationships for our brands with wholesale distributors in the forty-nine states we sell our products
 and our products are sold
in the U.S. by these wholesale distributors
 as well as by various state beverage alcohol control agencies.

Other
Sources of Revenue

Retail
Stores

During
2019 we had four retail stores in the Portland
 Oregon area that provided us with additional opportunities for sampling and sales
of our products. In January 2020
 we announced that we will be closing our retail stores. Effective March 23
 2020
all of these stores have been closed.

Significant
Customers

Sales
to one customer
 the Oregon Liquor Control Commission
 accounted for approximately 16% and 30% of our consolidated
sales for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.

Sales
Team

We
have a total sales force of approximately 24 people
 with an average of over ten years of industry experience with premium beverage
alcohol brands.

Our
sales personnel are engaged in the day-to-day management of our distributors
 which includes setting quotas
 coordinating promotional
plans for our brands
 maintaining adequate levels of stock
 brand education and training and sales calls with distributor personnel.
Our sales team also maintains relationships with key chain and retail customers through independent sales calls. They also schedule
promotional events
 create local brand promotion plans
 host in-store tastings
 where permitted
 and provide wait staff and bartender
training and education for our brands.

In
addition
 we have also engaged Park Street Imports
 a provider of back-office administrative
 fulfillment
 and logistical services
for alcohol and beverage distributors
 which services include state compliance
 logistics planning
 order processing
 order fulfillment
distributor chargeback and bill-support management and certain accounting and reporting services. In addition
 Park Street Imports
provides a factoring service that Eastside distilling can take advantage of to improve cash flow.

Advertising
Marketing and Promotion

To
build our brands
 we must effectively communicate with three distinct audiences: distributors
 retail trade and end consumers.
Advertising
 marketing and promotional activities help to establish and reinforce the image of our brands in our efforts to build
substantial brand value.


    
    


In
late 2016
 to aid us in this strategy
 we retained Sandstrom Partners
 a Portland-based firm specializing in spirits branding
and tasked them with reviewing our current product portfolio
 as well as our new ideas
 and advising us on marketing
 creation
of brand awareness and product positioning
 locally and nationally. We are using Sandstrom&rsquo;s full range of brand development
services
 including research
 strategy
 brand identity
 package design
 environments
 advertising as well as digital design and
development. During 2017
 Sandstrom Partners re-branded our key Burnside whiskey brand as well as developed the branding for &ldquo;Redneck
Riviera&rdquo; brand. Throughout 2018-2019 Sandstrom Partners was focused on a number of new and existing (re-branded) product
efforts. Some of those have now been launched including Hue Hue
 Granny Rich
 and the more recent Portland Mule and Howdy Dew
RTD products. Sandstrom Partners is currently working on the Azu&ntilde;ia tequila brand.

We
use a range of marketing strategies and tactics to build brand equity and increase sales
 including consumer and trade advertising
price promotions
 point-of-sale materials
 event sponsorship
 in-store and off-premise promotions and public relations
 as well
as a variety of other traditional and non-traditional marketing techniques
 including social media marketing
 to support our brands.

Besides
traditional advertising
 we also employ three other marketing methods to support our brands: public relations
 event sponsorships
and tastings. Our significant U.S. public relations efforts have helped gain editorial coverage for our brands
 which increases
brand awareness. Event sponsorship is an economical way for us to have influential consumers taste our brands. We actively contribute
product to trend-setting events where our brand has exclusivity in the brand category. We also conduct in-store promotions at
our off-premise accounts.

We
support our brand marketing efforts with an assortment of point-of-sale materials. The combination of trade and consumer programs
supported by attractive point-of-sale materials
 also establishes greater credibility for us with our distributors and retailers.

Intellectual
Property

Trademarks
are an important aspect of our business. We sell our products under a number of trademarks
 which we own or use under license
including the Redneck Rivera trademark
 which is owned by Rich Marks and described above under &ldquo;Item 1 - Business - Our
Brands&rdquo;. Our brands are protected by trademark registrations or are the subject of pending applications for trademark registration
in the U.S. where we distribute
 or plan to distribute
 our brands. The trademarks may be registered in the names of our subsidiaries.
In the U.S.
 trademark registrations need to be renewed every ten years. We expect to register our trademarks in additional markets
as we expand our distribution territories.



Our
business has historically followed the spirits industry seasonality trends with peak sales generally occurring in the fourth calendar
quarter
 primarily due to seasonal holiday buying. However
 as our business has evolved and as we continue to expand our footprint
in the national distribution platform
 our sales growth has been more dependent on the timing of successful sales efforts and
shipment of product to customers
 but there remains a concentration of buying and stocking our chains ahead of the holiday season.



Our
industry is highly competitive. We believe that we compete on the basis of quality
 price
 brand recognition and distribution
strength. Our premium brands compete with other alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages for consumer purchases
 retail shelf space
and wholesaler attention. We compete with numerous tier 1 multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products
many of which have greater resources than us.

Over
the past ten years
 the U.S. wine and spirits industry has undergone dramatic consolidation and realignment of brands and brand
ownership. The number of major importers in the U.S. has declined significantly. Today
 we believe eight major companies dominate
the market: Diageo PLC
 Pernod Ricard S.A.
 Bacardi Limited
 Brown-Forman Corporation
 Beam Suntory Inc.
 Davide Campari Milano-S.p.A.
and Remy Cointreau S.A. These competitors have substantially greater resources than we do.

We
believe we are a leading tier 2 participant that is in a prime position to partner with small-to-mid-size spirit brands
as opposed to the major importers and tier 1 multinationals. Despite our relative capital position and resources
 we have been
able to compete with these larger companies in pursuing agency distribution agreements and acquiring brands by being more responsive
to private and family-owned brands
 offering flexible transaction structures. Given our size relative to our major tier 1 competitors
most of which have multi-billion dollar operations
 we believe that we can provide greater focus on smaller brands and tailor
transaction structures based on individual brand owner preferences. However
 our relative capital position and resources may limit
our marketing capabilities
 our ability to expand into new markets and our negotiating ability with our distributors.


    
    



By
focusing on the premium and super-premium segments of the market
 which typically have higher prices per case and gross profit
margins
 and having an established
 experienced sales force
 we believe we are able to gain relatively significant attention from
our distributors for a company of our size. Also
 the continued consolidation among the major companies is expected to create
an opportunity for small to mid-size wine and spirits companies
 such as Eastside to penetrate markets
 as the major companies
contract their portfolios to focus on fewer brands.

Government
Regulation

We
are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act
 U.S. Customs laws
 and the Alcoholic Beverage Control
laws of all fifty states
 among many other regulations.

The
U.S. Treasury Department&rsquo;s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau regulates the production
 blending
 bottling
 sales
and advertising and transportation of alcohol products. Also
 each state regulates the advertising
 promotion
 transportation
sale and distribution of alcohol products within its jurisdiction. We are also required to conduct business in the U.S. only with
holders of licenses to import
 warehouse
 transport
 distribute and sell spirits.

We
are subject to U.S. regulations on the advertising
 marketing and sale of beverage alcohol. These regulations range from a complete
prohibition of the marketing of alcohol in some states to restrictions on advertising style
 media and messages.

Labeling
of spirits is also regulated in many markets
 varying from health warning labels to importer identification
 alcohol strength
and other consumer information. All beverage alcohol products sold in the U.S. must include warning statements related to risks
of drinking beverage alcohol products.

In
the U.S. control states
 the state liquor commissions act in place of distributors and decide which products are to be purchased
and offered for sale in their respective states. Products are selected for purchase and sale through listing procedures which
are generally made available to new products only at periodically scheduled listing interviews. Consumers may purchase products
not selected for listings only through special orders
 if at all.

The
distribution of alcohol-based beverages is also subject to extensive federal and state taxation in the U.S. and internationally.
Most foreign countries impose excise duties on wines and distilled spirits
 although the form of such taxation varies from a simple
application on units of alcohol by volume to intricate systems based on the imported or wholesale value of the product. Several
countries impose additional import duty on distilled spirits
 often discriminating between categories in the rate of such tariffs.
Once we begin distributing our products internationally
 import and excise duties could have a significant effect on our sales
both through reducing the consumption of alcohol and through encouraging consumer switching into lower-taxed categories of alcohol.



As
of March 30
 2020
 we have 89 employees
 23 of whom were in sales and marketing
 58 in production/canning/bottling
and 8 whom were in administration. All employees are full-time. We will continue to monitor our staffing in light of
the impacts of the coronavirus and streamlining on our operations for working capital needs.

Geographic
Information

Eastside
currently sells its products in 49 states
 as well as in Ontario
 Canada.


    
    



Item
1A. RISK FACTORS

The
statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction
with &ldquo;Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements&rdquo; to this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 as well as our other disclosures in this Annual
Report. We may have other risks that we have not yet identified or that we currently believe are immaterial but may become material.

RISKS
RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS

We
require additional capital
 which we may not be able to obtain on acceptable terms
 or at all. Our inability to access or raise
such capital
 as needed
 on beneficial terms or at all could restrict our future growth and severely limit our operations.

We
require additional capital in order to continue our operations
 and failure to obtain such additional capital could limit our
operations and our growth
 including our ability to continue to develop
 grow and maintain existing brands
 service our
debt and other obligations
 maintain adequate inventory levels
 fund potential acquisitions of new brands
 maintain
existing distribution relationships and retail channels
 penetrate new markets
 attract new customers and enter into new distribution
relationships. We have not generated sufficient cash from operations to finance additional capital needs
 and we will need to
raise additional funds through private or public equity and/or debt financing. We cannot assure you that additional financing
will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Because we have collateralized our assets and secured debt
 our
ability to obtain additional debt financing by offering security to lenders may be limited. If additional capital is either unavailable
or cost prohibitive
 our operations and growth may be limited
 and we may need to change our business strategy to slow the rate
of
 or eliminate
 our expansion or to reduce or curtail our operations. Also
 any additional financing we undertake could impose
covenants upon us that restrict our operating flexibility
 and
 if we issue equity securities to raise capital
 our existing shareholders
may experience dilution and the new securities may have rights
 preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock.

If
our brands do not achieve more widespread consumer acceptance
 our sales
 growth
 and profitability may be limited.

Although
certain of our brands continue to achieve acceptance
 most of our brands are relatively new and have not achieved national brand
recognition. We have not yet had success growing a brand to a sufficient level to realize profitability and be in a position
to sell the brand for a profit. Also
 brands we may develop and/or acquire in the future may not establish widespread brand
recognition. Accordingly
 if consumers do not accept our brands at scale
 our sales will be limited and we will not be able to
penetrate our markets.

In
addition
 our profitability depends in part on achieving scale. We will need to achieve wider market acceptance of our brands
and materially increase sales and gain profitability.

We
have incurred significant operating losses every quarter since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant
operating losses in the future.

We
believe that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we expect to make continued significant investment
in product development
 sales and marketing
 brand support and to incur significant administrative expenses as we
seek to grow our brands. We also anticipate that our cash needs will exceed our income from sales for the foreseeable future.
Some of our products may never achieve widespread market acceptance and may not generate sales and profits to justify our investment
in them. Also
 we may find that our expansion plans are more costly than we anticipate and that they do not ultimately result
in commensurate increases in our sales or profits
 which would further increase our losses. We expect we will continue to experience
losses and negative cash flow
 some of which could be significant. Results of operations will depend upon numerous factors
 some
of which are beyond our control
 including market acceptance of our products
 new product introductions and competition. We also
incur substantial operating expenses at the corporate level
 including costs directly related to being a reporting company with
the SEC. For the year ended December 31
 2019
 we reported a net loss of $16.9 million. As of December 31
 2019
 we had
an accumulated deficit since inception of $44.2 million.


    
    



The
success of our Redneck Riviera brand is dependent on our relationship with and on the reputation and popularity of singer and
songwriter John Rich. Any adverse reactions to publicity relating to Mr. Rich
 or the loss of his services and relationship
could adversely affect our revenues of the Redneck Riviera brand and results of operations as well as our ability to maintain
our consumer base and brand reputation.

In
October 2017
 we were granted an exclusive license for the use of the Redneck Riviera brand for spirits-based products. The Redneck
Riviera trademark is owned by Rich Marks
 which is controlled by John Rich
 a &ldquo;multiple platinum&rdquo; country music singer
and songwriter who performs with the &ldquo;Big &amp; Rich&rdquo; band. Beginning in 2020
 we will be required to meet certain
levels of case sales
 and if such sale levels are not met
 Rich Marks will have the right to terminate the license.

In
addition
 the success of Redneck Riviera Whiskey may be negatively impacted by a number of factors
 including the reputation and
popularity of Mr. Rich. Mr. Rich&rsquo;s reputation may be harmed due to factors outside of our control
 which could negatively
impact our brand image and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we fail to maintain and enhance the Redneck Riviera
brand
 or if excessive expenses are incurred in an effort to do so
 our business
 financial condition and results of operations
could be materially and adversely affected.

In
addition
 if our relationship with Mr. Rich deteriorates
 our reputation and operating results may be adversely affected. In late
2019
 we amended our license agreement related to the Redneck Riviera trademark in part because of our desire to continue to motive
Mr. Rich to use exceptional efforts to promote the RRW brand and a recognition of our ongoing relationship. The license agreement
generally provides
 among other things
 that we may not take any action which is harmful or potentially harmful to Mr. Rich&rsquo;s
or the brand&rsquo;s reputation. The license agreement also provides for other termination rights related to our solvency
 providing
reports and other matters.

If
we are unable to maintain our current associations with Mr. Rich at a reasonable cost
 or we experience an unplanned interruption
or termination of our collaboration
 we could lose the benefits of this relationship and the return on our substantial
investment in the brand.

We
must attract new Board members to provide valuable contributions to the Company and ensure that we meet Nasdaq independence requirements.
In addition
 new directors will not be voted on by stockholders until our Annual Meeting in 2020.

At
our Annual Meeting held on August 8
 2019
 four members of our Board who were nominees resigned and/or did not get re-elected.
Those directors comprised all but one of our nominated independent directors and comprised all of the members of our independent
Board committees. As a result
 at such time
 we did not comply with the independence requirements of Nasdaq
 the exchange on which
we list our common stock. We appointed several new directors and re-gained compliance with the Nasdaq independence requirements
in September 2019
 although we again fell out of compliance on November 12
 2019 due to a director resignation and the appointment
of Lawrence Firestone
 a then-independent director
 as our Chief Executive Officer. We promptly came back into compliance on November
18
 2019
 however
 future non-compliance with Nasdaq listing rules could result in our delisting. In addition
 our corporate governance
and risk and strategic oversight will suffer until we have a sufficient number of talented independent directors to our Board
including those with industry experience. In addition
 because we added new directors after our Annual Meeting and needed
to appoint additional directors to regain compliance
 the new directors will serve without shareholder approval until our Annual
Meeting in 2020.

Executive
departures and any other failure to attract or retain key executive or employee talent
 or further changes in our talent
 could
adversely affect our business.

Our
success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management team
 other key employees
 and a high-quality employee
base
 as well as our ability to attract
 motivate
 reward
 and retain them. If we or one of our executive officers or significant
employees terminates her or his employment
 we may not be able to replace their expertise
 fully integrate new personnel or replicate
the prior working relationships
 and the loss of their services might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business
objectives. Qualified individuals with the breadth of skills and experience in our industry that we require are in high demand
and we may incur significant costs to attract them. We do not maintain and do not intend to obtain key person insurance on the
life of any executive or employee. Difficulties in hiring or retaining key executive or employee talent
 or the unexpected loss
of experienced employees could have an adverse impact our business performance. In addition
 we could experience business disruption
and/or increased costs related to organizational changes
 reductions in workforce
 or other cost-cutting measures.


    
    



We
recently experienced significant changes to our executive leadership team. In May 2019
 our Chief Executive Officer announced
his transition to Executive Chairperson
 stepping down from his dual role as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
 and has since
that time left our Board. Our Chief Financial Officer
 Steven Shum
 was appointed as Interim Chief Executive Officer
 but resigned
as Interim Chief Executive Officer effective October 7
 2019 and announced his resignation as Chief Financial Officer effective
as of November 14
 2019 and G. Stuart Schreiner was appointed as Interim Chief Financial Officer
 effective February 28
 2020.
Effective November 12
 2019
 Lawrence Firestone was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer. This executive leadership transition
has the potential to disrupt our operations and relationships with employees
 customers
 suppliers
 and investors. In addition
Mr. Firestone had no prior experience in our industry. Our future operating results depend substantially upon the continued
service of our key personnel and in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management personnel. If
we are unable to mitigate these or other similar risks
 our business activity could be disrupted
 and our financial condition
and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

We
depend on a limited number of suppliers. Failure to obtain satisfactory performance from our suppliers or loss of our existing
suppliers could cause us to lose sales
 incur additional costs and lose credibility in the marketplace.

We
depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the sourcing of the raw materials for all of our products
 including our
distillate products and other ingredients. Azu&ntilde;ia
 in particular
 is sourced from a single supplier in Mexico. Other than
our long-term exclusive agreement with Agaveros Unidos de Amatitan
 SA. de CV. for the Azu&ntilde;ia tequila brand
we do not have long-term
 written agreements with any of our suppliers. The termination of our relationships or an adverse change
in the terms of these arrangements (including with Agaveros Unidos) could have a negative impact on our business. If our suppliers
increase their prices
 we may not be able to secure alternative suppliers
 and may not be able to raise the prices of our products
to cover all or even a portion of the increased costs. Also
 our suppliers&rsquo; failure to perform satisfactorily or handle
increased orders
 delays in shipments of products from suppliers or the loss of our existing suppliers
 especially our key suppliers
could cause us to fail to meet orders for our products
 lose sales
 incur additional costs and/or expose us to product quality
issues. In turn
 this could cause us to lose credibility in the marketplace and damage our relationships with distributors
 ultimately
leading to a decline in our business and results of operations. If we are not able to renegotiate these contracts on acceptable
terms or find suitable alternatives
 our business
 financial condition or results of operations could be negatively impacted.

Our
contract with Agaveros Unidos runs through July 2039 and has set pricing for the tequila and bottling services they provide. The
contract includes an exclusivity clause. We are committed to purchase 24
000 9-liter cases in 2020 and 35
000 9-liter cases in
2021. We have no expressed commitments beyond 2021. A breach of this contract
 including minimum purchase commitments
could lead to a $2 million penalty and termination of the contract
 and result in a failure of the Azu&ntilde;ia
brand.

Our
outstanding debt could reduce our strategic flexibility and liquidity and may have other adverse effects on our results of operations

We
have incurred significant debt under promissory notes and inventory financing lines. Much of our debt is secured by our
bulk spirit inventory and other assets
 including our Craft Canning business. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations
depends upon our operating and financial performance
 which is subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial
business and other factors affecting our operations
 many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to service our debt
we may need to sell inventory and other material assets
 restructure or refinance our debt
 or seek additional equity capital.
Prevailing economic conditions and global credit markets could adversely impact our ability to do so.

Our
debt agreements contain limits on our ability to
 among other things
 incur additional debt
 grant liens
 undergo
certain fundamental changes
 make investments
 and dispose of inventory. We are also required to maintain compliance with a total
leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio and for our secured inventory to have a market value relative to our outstanding
debt balance.


    
    



The
amount and terms of our debt
 could have important consequences
 including the following:



    
    
prematurely
                                         pay down our outstanding debt balance if the market value of our bulk spirits falls and
                                         we need to remain within our borrowing base covenants;


    
    
we
    may be more vulnerable to economic downturns
 less able to withstand competitive pressures
 and less flexible in responding
    to changing business and economic conditions;

    
    
we
    may be more limited in our ability to execute on our strategy and have flexibility to operate or restructure our business;

    
    
our
    cash flow from operations may be allocated to the payment of outstanding debt and not to developing and growing our brands;

    
    
we
    might not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or other sources to enable us to meet our payment obligations under
    the facility and to fund other liquidity needs;

    
    
an
 to incur additional debt
 including for working
    capital
 acquisitions
 or other needs.



If
we breach a loan covenant or miss a payment
 the lenders could accelerate the repayment of debt and foreclose on our inventory
and other assets. We might not have sufficient assets to repay our debt upon acceleration. If we are unable to repay or
refinance the debt upon acceleration or at maturity
 the lenders could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding against us or collection
proceedings with respect to our assets securing the facility
 which could materially decrease the value of our common stock.

We
depend on our independent wholesale distributors to distribute our products. The failure or inability of even a few of our distributors
to distribute our products adequately within their territories could harm our sales and result in a decline in our results of
operations.

We
are required by law to use state-licensed distributors or
 in 17 states known as &ldquo;control states
&rdquo; state-owned
agencies performing this function
 to sell our products to retail outlets
 including liquor stores
 bars
 restaurants and national
chains in the United States. We have established relationships for our brands with a limited number of wholesale distributors;
however
 failure to maintain those relationships could significantly and adversely affect our business
 sales and growth. We currently
distribute our products in 49 states.

Over
the past decade there has been increasing consolidation
 both intrastate and interstate
 among distributors. As a result
 many
states now have only two or three significant distributors. Also
 there are several distributors that now control distribution
for several states. If we fail to maintain good relations with a distributor
 our products could
 in some instances be frozen
out of one or more markets entirely. The ultimate success of our products also depends in large part on our distributors&rsquo;
ability and desire to distribute our products to our desired U.S. target markets
 as we rely significantly on them for product
placement and retail store penetration. In addition
 all of our distributors also distribute competitive brands and product lines.
We cannot assure you that our U.S. distributors will continue to purchase our products
 commit sufficient time and resources to
promote and market our brands and product lines or that they can or will sell them to our desired or targeted markets. If they
do not
 our sales will be harmed
 resulting in a decline in our results of operations.

We
rely on a few key distributors
 and the loss of any one key distributor would substantially reduce our revenues.

We
currently derive a significant amount of our revenues from a few major distributors. A significant decrease in business from or
loss of any of our major distributors could harm our financial condition by causing a significant decline in revenues attributable
to such distributors. Sales to two distributors accounted for approximately 25% and 42% of our consolidated sales
for 2019 and 2018
 respectively. While we believe our relationships with our major distributors are good
 we do not have long-term
contracts with any of them and purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis. If we experience a significant decrease in
sales to any of our major distributors and are unable to replace such sales volume with orders from other customers
 our sales
may decrease which would have a material adverse financial effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

The
sales of our products could decrease significantly if we cannot secure and maintain listings in the control states.

In
the control states
 the state liquor commissions act in place of distributors and decide which products are to be purchased and
offered for sale in their respective states. Products selected for listing in control states must generally reach certain volumes
and/or profit levels to maintain their listings. Products in control states are selected for purchase and sale through listing
procedures
 which are generally made available to new products only at periodically scheduled listing interviews. Products not
selected for listings can only be purchased by consumers in the applicable control state through special orders
 if at all. If
in the future
 we are unable to maintain our current listings in the control states
 or secure and maintain listings in those
states for any additional products we may develop or acquire
 sales of our products could decrease significantly
 which would
have a material adverse financial effect on our results of operations and financial condition.


    
    



We
must maintain a relatively large inventory of our products to support customer delivery requirements
 and if this inventory is
out of stock
 lost due to foreclosure
 theft
 fire or other damage or becomes obsolete
 our results of operations would
be negatively impacted.

We
maintain relatively large inventories of our product aging in barrels
 as well as
 to meet customer delivery requirements. We
have used our barreled spirits inventory at market value as collateral in our financing. If we do not timely make
payments on our financing obligations
 or we breach our covenants in any financing document
 including maintaining loan-to-value
ratios
 the lenders may foreclose and take possession of our inventory. In addition
 this inventory is always at risk of loss
due to theft
 fire
 evaporation
 spoilage or other damage
 and any such loss
 whether insured against or not
 could cause
us to fail to meet our orders and harm our sales and operating results. Also
 our inventory may become obsolete as we introduce
new products
 cease to produce old products or modify the design of our products&rsquo; packaging
 which would increase our operating
losses and negatively impact our results of operations.

If
we are unable to identify and successfully acquire additional brands that are complementary to our existing portfolio
 our growth
will be limited
 and
 even if additional brands are acquired
 we may not realize anticipated benefits
 due to market acceptance
integration difficulties or other operating issues.

A
component of our growth strategy may be the acquisition of additional brands that are complementary to our existing portfolio
through the acquisition of such brands or their corporate owners
 directly as brand acquisitions or through mergers
 joint
ventures
 long-term exclusive distribution arrangements and/or other strategic relationships. For example
 in September 2019
we acquired the high-end
 luxury tequila brand
 Azu&ntilde;ia
 to complement our portfolio and provide us with a brand in the
high-growth tequila category. In addition
 we acquired MotherLode in March 2017
 which provides contract canning
 bottling and
packaging services for existing and emerging spirits producers
 and in January 2019
 we completed the acquisition of Craft Canning
which significantly adds to our contract canning
 bottling and packaging services. If we are unable to identify or have the
financial ability to acquire suitable brand candidates and successfully execute our acquisition strategy
 our growth will
be limited. In addition
 our entry into and expansion of our contract bottling
 canning
 and packaging services as a result of
our acquisitions of MotherLode and Craft Canning may not be successful
 and we may not realize the benefits of these co-packing
operations and may face certain risks
 including safety concerns
 product contamination
 and equipment malfunctions or breakdowns
among other things associated with our manufacturing operations. In addition
 if our bottling
 canning
 or packaging services
fail to meet our customers&rsquo; expectations
 or there is an overall decline in demand for bottling
 canning
 or packaging services
our reputation
 business
 results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

If
we are successful in acquiring additional brands or related service businesses
 we may still fail to achieve our target margins
or maintain profitability levels that would justify our investment in those additional brands or services or fail to realize
operating and economic efficiencies or other planned benefits with respect to those additional brands or services. For Craft Canning
we will need to provide increased capital to expand operations and for Azu&ntilde;ia we will need to increase our gross profit
margins substantially
 grow sales
 reduce cost and leverage distribution to become cash flow positive.

The
addition of new products or businesses entails numerous risks with respect to integration and other operating issues
 any of which
could have a detrimental effect on our results of operations and/or the value of our equity. These risks include
 but are not
limited to:



    
    
difficulties
    in assimilating acquired operations or products
 including failure to realize synergies;

    
    
    

    
    
failure
    to realize or anticipate benefits or to execute on our planned strategy for the acquired brand or business;

    
    
    

    
    
unanticipated
    costs that could materially adversely affect our results of operations;

    
    
    

    
    
negative
    effects on reported results of operations from acquisition-related charges and amortization of acquired intangibles;



    
    





    
    
diversion
    of management&rsquo;s attention from other business concerns;

    
    
    

    
    
adverse
    effects on existing business relationships with suppliers
 distributors and retail customers;

    
    
    

    
    
risks
    of entering new markets or markets in which we have limited prior experience; and

    
    
    

    
    
the
    potential inability to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses.


Our
ability to grow through the acquisition of additional brands is also dependent upon identifying acceptable acquisition targets
and opportunities
 our ability to consummate prospective transactions on favorable terms
 or at all
 and the availability of capital
to complete the necessary acquisition arrangements. We intend to finance our brand acquisitions through a combination of our available
cash resources
 third-party financing and
 in appropriate circumstances
 the further issuance of equity and/or debt securities.
Acquiring additional brands could have a significant effect on our financial position and could cause substantial fluctuations
in our quarterly and yearly operating results. Also
 acquisitions could result in the recording of significant goodwill and intangible
assets on our financial statements
 the amortization or impairment of which would reduce reported earnings in subsequent years.

Our
failure to protect our trademarks and trade secrets could compromise our competitive position and decrease the value of our brand
portfolio.

Our
business and prospects depend in part on our ability to develop favorable consumer recognition of our brands and trademarks. Although
we apply for registration of our brands and trademarks
 they could be imitated in ways that we cannot prevent. Also
 we rely on
trade secrets and proprietary know-how
 concepts and formulas. Our methods of protecting this information may not be adequate.
Moreover
 we may face claims of misappropriation or infringement of third parties&rsquo; rights that could interfere with our
use of this information. Defending these claims may be costly and
 if unsuccessful
 may prevent us from continuing to use this
proprietary information in the future and result in a judgment or monetary damages being levied against us. We do not maintain
non-competition agreements with all of our key personnel or with some of our key suppliers. If competitors independently develop
or otherwise obtain access to our trade secrets
 proprietary know-how or recipes
 the appeal
 and thus the value
 of our brand
portfolio could be reduced
 negatively impacting our sales and growth potential.

A
failure of one or more of our key or service product information technology systems
 cyber-security breach or cyber-related fraud
could have a material adverse impact on our business.

We
rely on information technology (&ldquo;IT&rdquo;) systems
 networks
 and services
 including internet sites
 data hosting and
processing facilities and tools
 hardware (including laptops and mobile devices)
 and software and technical applications and
platforms
 some of which are managed
 hosted
 provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors
 to assist us in the management
of our business.

Increased
IT security threats and more sophisticated cyber-crime pose a potential risk to the security of our IT systems
 networks
 and
services
 as well as to the confidentiality
 availability
 and integrity of our data. If the IT systems
 networks
 or service
providers we rely upon fail to function properly
 or if we suffer a loss or disclosure of business or other sensitive information
due to any number of causes
 ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches
 and our business continuity
plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis
 we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations
and reputational
 competitive and/or business harm
 which may adversely affect our business operations and/or financial condition.
In addition
 such events could result in unauthorized disclosure of material confidential information
 and we may suffer financial
and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us or to our partners
 our employees
customers
 suppliers or consumers. In any of these events
 we could also be required to spend significant financial and other
resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and IT systems.

We
may not be able to collect on notes receivable.

We
currently have secured notes receivables from a Canadian online seller of spirits that mature in 2020. If the debtor
fails to pay the note receivable on the maturity date we may incur costs related to collections
 foreclosure and ultimately
declare the debt uncollectable.


    
    



We
are subject to litigation risks.

From
time to time
 we may become involved in various litigation matters and claims
 including employment
 regulatory proceedings
administrative proceedings
 governmental investigations
 and contract disputes. We may face potential claims or liability for
among other things
 breach of contract
 defamation
 libel
 fraud
 or negligence. We may also face employment-related litigation
including claims of age discrimination
 sexual harassment
 gender discrimination
 immigration violations
 or other local
 state
and federal labor law violations. For instance
 two former employees have made claims that our current and former management engaged
in gender discrimination and sexually harassing manner. Because of the uncertain nature of litigation and insurance coverage decisions
the outcome of such actions and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of
them could have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition
 results of operations
 cash flows
 reputation
brand identity and the trading price of our securities. Any such litigation
 with or without merit
 could also result in substantial
expenditures of time and money
 and divert attention of our management team from other tasks important to the success of our business.

If
we fail to manage growth effectively or prepare for product scalability
 it could have an adverse effect on our employee efficiency
product quality
 working capital levels and results of operations.

Any
significant growth in the market for our products or our entry into new markets may require an expansion of our employee base
for managerial
 operational
 financial
 and other purposes. During any period of growth
 we may face problems related to our operational
and financial systems and controls
 including quality control and delivery and service capacities. We would also need to continue
to expand
 train and manage our employee base. Continued future growth will impose significant added responsibilities upon the
members of management to identify
 recruit
 maintain
 integrate
 and motivate new employees. Aside from increased difficulties
in the management of human resources
 we may also encounter working capital issues
 as we will need increased liquidity to finance
the marketing of the products we sell
 and the hiring of additional employees. For effective growth management
 we will be required
to continue improving our operations
 management
 and financial systems and controls. Our failure to manage growth effectively
may lead to operational and financial inefficiencies that will have a negative effect on our profitability. We cannot assure investors
that we will be able to timely and effectively meet that demand and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and
potential customers.


RISKS
RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY

Demand
for our products may be adversely affected by many factors
 including changes in consumer preferences and trends.

Consumer
preferences may shift due to a variety of factors
 including changes in demographic and social trends
 public health initiatives
product innovations
 changes in vacation or leisure
 dining and beverage consumption patterns and a downturn in economic conditions
any or all of which may reduce consumers&rsquo; willingness to purchase distilled spirits or cause a shift in consumer preferences
toward beer
 wine or non-alcoholic beverages or other products. Our success depends in part on fulfilling available opportunities
to meet consumer needs and anticipating changes in consumer preferences with successful new products and product innovations.

A
limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety
of factors
 including:



    
    
a
    general decline in economic or geopolitical conditions;

    
    
    

    
    
changing
    consumer preferences
 including to other beverage products or alternatives to alcoholic beverages;

    
    
    

    
    
concern
    about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and driving;



    
    





    
    
a
    general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in on-premises establishments
 which may result from smoking
    bans and stricter laws relating to driving while under the influence of alcohol;

    
    
    

    
    
consumer
    dietary preferences favoring lighter
 lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks
 sports drinks and water products;

    
    
    

    
    
increased
    federal
 state
 provincial and foreign excise or other taxes on beverage alcohol products and possible restrictions on beverage
    alcohol advertising and marketing;

    
    
    

    
    
increased
    regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beverage alcohol products or increasing prices due to the
    imposition of duties or excise taxes;

    
    
    

    
    
inflation;
    and

    
    
    

    
    
wars
    pandemics
 weather and natural or man-made disasters.


In
addition
 our continued success depends
 in part
 on our ability to develop new products to meet consumer needs and anticipate
changes in consumer preferences. The launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain
 especially with regard
to their appeal to consumers. The launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs
 and an unsuccessful launch
 among
other things
 can affect consumer perception of existing brands and our reputation. Unsuccessful implementation or short-lived
popularity of our product innovations may result in inventory write-offs and other costs.

In
addition
 the legalization of marijuana in any of the jurisdictions in which we sell our products may result in a reduction in
sales. Studies have shown that sales of alcohol may decrease in jurisdictions where marijuana has been legalized (e.g. California
Colorado
 Washington
 Nevada
 Alaska
 Illinois
 Vermont
 Massachusetts
 Maine
 Michigan and Oregon). As a result
 marijuana sales
may adversely affect our sales and profitability.

We
face substantial competition in our industry and many factors may prevent us from competing successfully.

We
compete on the basis of product taste and quality
 brand image
 price
 service and ability to innovate in response to consumer
preferences. The global spirits industry is highly competitive and is dominated by several large
 well-funded international companies.
Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and have substantially greater financial
 sales
marketing and other resources than we do
 as well as larger installed customer bases
 greater name recognition and broader product
offerings. Some of these competitors can devote greater resources to the development
 promotion
 sale and support of their products.
As a result
 it is possible that our competitors may either respond to industry conditions or consumer trends more rapidly or
effectively or resort to price competition to sustain market share
 which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.

Our
business may be disrupted by crisis such as the Covid-19 pandemic.

Our
business is suspectable to disruption from any number of possible crisis. The impact of business and government responses to the
Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the operations and financial condition of many businesses. Those include employees
being required to work remotely
 not travel and otherwise alter their normal working conditions. Businesses have been closed
including establishments that sell our products
 and supply chains and manufacturing have been disrupted. Consumers buying
habits have shifted to buying larger package of spirits (e.g. 1.75 liter) sized packages
 which we do not sell in our mainstream
brands. These and other impacts from the Covid-19 and any other similar crisis could have a material impact on our operations
and financial results.

Class
actions or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse or the misuse of alcohol could adversely affect our business.

Our
industry faces the possibility of class action or similar litigation alleging that the continued excessive use or abuse of beverage
alcohol has caused death or serious health problems or related to the labelling of our products. It is also possible that governments
could assert that the use of alcohol has significantly increased government-funded healthcare costs. Litigation or assertions
of this type have adversely affected companies in the tobacco industry
 and it is possible that we
 as well as our suppliers
could be named in litigation of this type.


    
    



Also
lawsuits have been brought in a number of states alleging that beverage alcohol manufacturers and marketers have improperly targeted
underage consumers in their advertising. Plaintiffs in these cases allege that the defendants&rsquo; advertisements
 marketing
and promotions violate the consumer protection or deceptive trade practices statutes in each of these states and seek repayment
of the family funds expended by the underage consumers. While we have not been named in these lawsuits
 we could be named in similar
lawsuits in the future. Any class action or other litigation asserted against us could be expensive and time-consuming to defend
against
 depleting our cash and diverting our personnel resources and
 if the plaintiffs in such actions were to prevail
 our
business could be harmed significantly.

Regulatory
decisions and legal
 regulatory and tax changes could limit our business activities
 increase our operating costs and reduce our
margins.

Our
business is subject to extensive government regulation. This may include regulations regarding production
 distribution
 marketing
advertising and labeling of beverage alcohol products. We are required to comply with these regulations and to maintain various
permits and licenses. We are also required to conduct business only with holders of licenses to import
 warehouse
 transport
distribute and sell beverage alcohol products. We cannot assure you that these and other governmental regulations applicable to
our industry will not change or become more stringent. Moreover
 because these laws and regulations are subject to interpretation
we may not be able to predict when and to what extent liability may arise. Additionally
 due to increasing public concern over
alcohol-related societal problems
 including driving while intoxicated
 underage drinking
 alcoholism and health consequences
from the abuse of alcohol
 various levels of government may seek to impose additional restrictions or limits on advertising or
other marketing activities promoting beverage alcohol products. Failure to comply with any of the current or future regulations
and requirements relating to our industry and products could result in monetary penalties
 suspension or even revocation of our
licenses and permits. Costs of compliance with changes in regulations could be significant and could harm our business
 as we
could find it necessary to raise our prices in order to maintain profit margins
 which could lower the demand for our products
and reduce our sales and profit potential.

Also
the distribution of beverage alcohol products is subject to extensive taxation (at both the federal and state government levels)
and beverage alcohol products themselves are the subject of national import and excise duties in most countries around the world.
An increase in taxation or in import or excise duties could also significantly harm our sales revenue and margins
 both through
the reduction of overall consumption and by encouraging consumers to switch to lower-taxed categories of beverage alcohol. Although
we expect a significantly positive impact on our operating results from the enactment of the Craft Modernization and Tax Reform
Act of 2017
 which was part of the 2017 federal tax legislation that went into effect on January 1
 2018
 resulting from the lowering
of the federal excise tax on spirits for the first 100
000 proof gallons per year from $13.50 to $2.70 per gallon
 there can be
no assurance this revised tax rate will remain in effect after the extension period ending December 31
 2020.

We
could face product liability or other related liabilities that increase our costs of operations and harm our reputation. In addition
our insurance coverage might not be adequate.

Although
we maintain liability insurance and will attempt to limit contractually our liability for damages arising from our products
 these
measures may not be sufficient for us to successfully avoid or limit product liability or other related liabilities. Our product
liability insurance coverage is limited to $2 million per occurrence and $5 million in the aggregate and our general liability
umbrella policy is capped at $2 million
 which may be insufficient. Further
 any contractual indemnification and insurance coverage
we have from parties supplying our products is limited
 as a practical matter
 to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party
and the insured limits of any insurance provided by these suppliers. In any event
 extensive product liability claims could be
costly to defend and/or costly to resolve and could harm our reputation or business.


    
    



Contamination
of our products and/or counterfeit or confusingly similar products could harm the image and integrity of
 or decrease customer
support for
 our brands and decrease our sales.

The
success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of them. Contamination
 whether arising accidentally
or through deliberate third-party action
 or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our brands
 could affect
the demand for our products. Contaminants in raw materials purchased from third parties and used in the production of our products
or defects in the distillation and fermentation processes could lead to low beverage quality
 as well as illness among
 or injury
to
 consumers of our products and could result in reduced sales of the affected brand or all of our brands and potentially serious
damage to our reputation for product quality
 as well as product liability claims. Also
 to the extent that third parties sell
products that are either counterfeit versions of our brands or brands that look like our brands
 consumers of our brands could
confuse our products with products that they consider inferior. This could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in
the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our sales and operations.

In
addition
 we also provide contract bottling
 canning
 and packaging services for existing and emerging beer
 wine and spirits
producers through our subsidiaries MotherLode and Craft Canning. Beer and wine products produced by third parties may be more
susceptible to contamination than the distilled products that we produce
 due to the lower alcohol content.

Adverse
public opinion about alcohol could reduce demand for our products.

Anti-alcohol
groups have
 in the past
 advocated successfully for more stringent labeling requirements
 higher taxes and other regulations
designed to discourage alcohol consumption. In addition
 recent developments in the industry may compel us to identify the source
and location of our distillate products and notify the consumer of whether the product was distilled by us. More restrictive regulations
negative publicity regarding alcohol consumption and/or changes in consumer perceptions of the relative healthfulness or safety
of beverage alcohol could decrease sales and consumption of alcohol and thus the demand for our products. This could
 in turn
significantly decrease both our revenues and our revenue growth
 causing a decline in our results of operations.

RISKS
RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK

Our
common stock is thinly traded
 and investors may be unable to sell some or all of their shares at the price they would like
 or
at all
 and sales of large blocks of shares may depress the price of our common stock.

Our
common stock has historically been sporadically or &ldquo;thinly-traded
&rdquo; meaning that the number of persons interested
in purchasing shares of our common stock at prevailing prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. As a
consequence
 there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in shares of our common stock is minimal or non-existent
as compared to a seasoned issuer that has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous
sales without an adverse effect on share price. This could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. Investors may be unable
to sell their common stock at or above their purchase price
 which may result in substantial losses. Also
 as a consequence of
this lack of liquidity
 the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our stockholders may disproportionately influence
the price of shares of our common stock in either direction. The price of shares of our common stock could
 for example
 decline
precipitously in the event a large number of shares of our common stock is sold on the market without commensurate demand
 as
compared to a seasoned issuer that could better absorb such sales without adverse impact on its share price.

Sales
of our stock or use of our stock to satisfy obligations  may impact the market price of our common stock and cause substantial
dilution.

We
likely will need to raise additional capital
 which might be in the form of an equity offering. Future sales of substantial amounts
of our common or preferred stock
 including shares that we may issue upon exercise of warrants or conversion of preferred stock
could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further
 if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity
the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and cause substantial dilution to current stockholders.


We
pay certain of our consultants and business partners in our common stock
 and sometimes settle debts with common stock. We also
pay executive compensation in the form of equity. These payments are based on the dollar value of what is owed
 rather than a
fixed number of shares. Continued use of our stock in this manner
 especially if our stock price is trading at a low price
 may
cause dilution to our shareholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

A
decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise working capital and adversely impact our ability to
continue operations.

A
further decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction
in our ability to raise capital. A decline in the price of our common stock could be especially detrimental to our liquidity and
our operations. Such reductions may force us to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may have a significant negative effect
on our business plans and operations
 including our ability to develop new services and continue our current operations. If our
common stock price further declines
 we can offer no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital or generate funds
from operations sufficient to meet our obligations. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital in the future
 we may not be
able to have the resources to continue our normal operations.

If
we are unable to continue as a going concern
 our securities will have little or no value.

We
have incurred operating losses since our inception
 and we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses
for the foreseeable future. Our financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going
concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm included in its opinion for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
an explanatory paragraph referring to our net loss from operations and net capital deficiency and expressing substantial doubt
in our ability to continue as a going concern without additional capital becoming available. If we are unable to generate sufficient
cash from operations or obtain additional financing in the future
 we might not be able to continue as a going concern. There
are no assurances that such financing
 if necessary
 will be available to us at all or will be available in sufficient amounts
or on reasonable terms. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
If we are unable to generate additional funds in the future through financings
 sales of our products or from other sources or
transactions
 we will exhaust our resources and will be unable to continue operations. If we cannot continue as a going concern
our stockholders would likely lose most or all of their investment in us.



    
    



Our
failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock.

In
August 2017
 our shares of common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing
requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market
 such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement
Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common
stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting
we would expect to take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq&rsquo;s listing requirements
 but we can provide no assurance
that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again
 stabilize the market price or improve the
liquidity of our common stock
 prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent
future non-compliance with Nasdaq&rsquo;s listing requirements. As of August 8
 2019
 we failed to comply with Nasdaq&rsquo;s
requirement to have a majority independent Board and independent audit and compensation committees. Although we regained compliance
with the Nasdaq listing requirements in September 2019
 we again fell out of compliance on November 12
 2019 due to a director
resignation and the appointment of Lawrence Firestone
 a then-independent director
 as our Chief Executive Officer. We promptly
came back into compliance on November 18
 2019.

While
our warrants are outstanding
 it may be more difficult to raise additional equity capital.

We
currently have non-trading
 privately issued common stock warrants to purchase 736
559 shares of common stock. During the term
that our warrants are outstanding
 the holders of the warrants will be given the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market
price of our common stock. We may find it more difficult to raise additional equity capital while we have warrants outstanding.
We might issue additional warrants along with a future financing.


We
do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.

For
the foreseeable future
 it is anticipated that earnings
 if any
 that may be generated from our operations will be used to finance
our operations and that cash dividends will not be paid to holders of common stock.

Our
largest stockholders have the power to significantly influence our decisions and their interests may conflict with ours or yours
in the future.

We
have several stockholders owning near or over 5% of our outstanding common stock
 according to public filings. In addition
 Stephanie
Kilkenny
 a member of our Board of Directors together with her spouse
 owns and controls TQLA
 LLC (&ldquo;TQLA&rdquo;)
 the majority
owner of Intersect Beverage
 LLC. In connection with the acquisition of Azu&ntilde;ia Tequila from Intersect Beverage
 LLC
 TQLA
may receive a substantial number of shares payable under the asset purchase agreement in 2021
 subject to a limitation under Nasdaq
rules if the share issuance would require a shareholder vote (e.g.
 we anticipate that the share issuance will be limited 19.99%
of our outstanding). Certain of our officers and directors
 such as our CEO Mr. Firestone
 and our Director Jack Peterson (through
his relationship with Sandstrom Partners)
 may become significant stockholders through the payment of equity compensation.

Accordingly
as a result of their direct and indirect beneficial ownership
 the foregoing stockholders may be able to exercise substantial
control and more directly influence our affairs and business
 including any determination with respect to a change in control
future issuances of common stock or other securities
 declaration of dividends on the common stock and the election of directors.
The stockholders may have interests that differ from the interests of other stockholders.


    
    



We
have the ability to issue additional shares of our common stock and shares of preferred stock without asking for stockholder approval
which could cause your investment to be diluted. However
 if we fail to obtain shareholder approval for additional authorized
common stock
 our financing alternatives will be limited.

Our
Articles of Incorporation authorize the Board to issue up to 15
000
000 shares of common stock and up to 100
000
000 shares of
preferred stock. The power of the Board to issue shares of common stock
 preferred stock or warrants or options to purchase shares
of common stock or preferred stock is generally not subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly
 any additional issuances of
our common stock
 or preferred stock that may be convertible into common stock
 may have the effect of diluting your investment
and the new securities may have rights
 preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock.

We
have over 11
000
000 shares of common stock outstanding or subject to warrants or other convertible securities. We are limited
to issuing up to 15
000
0000 shares of common stock. The limited number of available shares of common stock constrains our ability
to conduct equity offerings or engage in financing transactions that may have an equity component. In addition
 this limitation
will constrain our ability to grant equity incentives
 which could result in a failure to align management to shareholder objectives
or to be able to retain and motivate key personnel.

By
issuing preferred stock
 we may be able to delay
 defer
 or prevent a change of control.

Our
Articles of Incorporation permit us to issue
 without approval from our stockholders
 a total of 100
000
000 shares of preferred
stock. Our Board may determine the rights
 preferences
 privileges and restrictions granted to
 or imposed upon
 the shares of
preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series. It is possible that
our Board
 in determining the rights
 preferences and privileges to be granted when the preferred stock is issued
 may include
provisions that have the effect of delaying
 deferring or preventing a change in control
 discouraging bids for our common stock
at a premium over the market price
 or that adversely affect the market price of and the voting and other rights of the holders
of our common stock.

We
face risks related to compliance with corporate governance laws and financial reporting standards.

The
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&ldquo;Sarbanes-Oxley&rdquo;)
 as well as related rules and regulations implemented by the SEC and
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
 require compliance with certain corporate governance practices and financial reporting
standards for public companies. These laws
 rules and regulations
 including compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 relating to internal control over financial reporting (&ldquo;SOX 404&rdquo;)
 has materially increased our legal
and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time-consuming
 burdensome and expensive. Although we currently believe
our internal control over financial reporting is effective
 the effectiveness of our internal controls in future periods is subject
to the risk that our controls may become inadequate or may not operate effectively. Any failure to comply with the requirements
of SOX 404
 our ability to remediate any material weaknesses that we may identify during our compliance program
 or difficulties
encountered in their implementation
 could harm our operating results
 cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result
in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of the periodic
management evaluations of our internal controls and
 in the case of a failure to remediate any material weaknesses that we may
identify
 would adversely affect the annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting that are required under SOX 404. Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence
in our reported financial information
 which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock
 and we could
be subject to regulatory sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities
 which would require additional
financial and management resources.

3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We
are party to the legal proceeding described below. In addition
 we could be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time
to time in the ordinary course of our business
 or legal proceedings we considered immaterial may in the future become material.
Regardless of the outcome
 litigation can
 among other things
 be time consuming and expensive to resolve
 and divert management
resources.

On
October 22
 2019
 a complaint was filed against the Company in the Circuit Court of Oregon
 County of Multnomah by two former
employees
 Laurie Branch and Justina Thoreson. The complaint also named as defendants certain current and former officers and

 Inc. et al.
 case number 19-CV-45716
and alleged
 among other things
 that the Company and certain current and former officers and employees engaged in sex
discrimination
 retaliation for reporting sexual discrimination
 sexual harassment
 and aiding and abetting unlawful discrimination.
As relief
 the complaint sought among other things
 monetary damages of up to $560
000 and attorneys and experts&rsquo;
fees. This litigation was successfully mediated on March 20
 2020 and is in final stages of settlement. The Company&rsquo;s
insurer accepted initial defense of this matter
 with a reservation of rights. The Company is responsible for $100
000 retention
per claim.

5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT&rsquo;S COMMON EQUITY
 RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our
common stock trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market (&ldquo;Nasdaq&rdquo;) under the symbol &ldquo;EAST.&rdquo;





Our
shares of common stock are issued in registered form. The registrar and transfer agent for our shares of common stock is Transfer
Online
 Inc. 512 SE Salmon Street
 Portland
 OR 97214 (Telephone: (503) 227-2950).



    
    


As
of March 30
 2020
 there were 9
762
728 shares of our common stock outstanding
 which were held by approximately 95 record
stockholders. The number of record holders was determined from the records of our transfer agent and does not include beneficial
owners of shares of common stock whose shares are held in the names of various security brokers
 dealers
 and registered clearing
agencies.

Dividend
Policy

We
have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since our inception
 and we do not contemplate paying dividends in the foreseeable
future.

Recent
Sales of Unregistered Securities

The
following lists set forth information regarding all securities sold or granted by us within the past year that were not registered
under the Securities Act of 1933
 as amended (the &ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;)
 and the consideration
 if any
 received by us
for such securities:



    
In
    January 2019
 the Company issued warrants to purchase 30
000 common shares at an exercise price of $7.75 per share to a related
    party consultant. 

    
    

    
In
    January 2019
 the Company issued 338
212 shares of common stock as consideration in exchange for the acquisition of Craft
    Canning on January 11
 2019. In addition
 we issued a warrant to purchase 146
262 shares of common stock at a price of $7.80
    per share and exercise period for three years. The warrant is subject to the continuation of a consulting agreement and is
    not part of the purchase price of the acquisition. 

    
    

    
In
    September 2019
 the Company issued 280
555 units (the &ldquo;Units&rdquo;) in a private offering at a per Unit price of $4.50
    per share
 resulting in net cash proceeds of $1
262
497. Each Unit consists of one share of Eastside&rsquo;s common stock
    and a three-year warrant to acquire 0.5 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $5.50 per share.


None
of the foregoing transactions involved any underwriters
 underwriting discounts or commissions
 general solicitation or any public
offering
 and the Registrant believes each transaction was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act
 as
stated above. The Registrant believes that the Section 4(a)(2) or Rule 506(b) of Regulation D exemption applies to the transactions
described above because such transactions were predicated on the fact that the issuances were made only to investors who (i) confirmed
to the Registrant in writing that they are accredited investors
 or if not accredited
 have such knowledge and experience in financial
and business matters that they are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of their investment; and (ii) either received adequate
business and financial information about the Registrant or had access
 through their relationships with the Registrant
 to such
information. Furthermore
 the Registrant affixed appropriate legends to the share certificates and instruments issued in each
foregoing transaction setting forth that the securities had not been registered and the applicable restrictions on transfer.

Operating
as a small business in a large
 international spirits marketplace occupied by large multi-national conglomerates
 we seek to utilize
our size and our public company stature to our advantage and position Eastside Distilling as a leading tier 2 spirits provider
by acquiring and developing brands
 growing them to a national presence and positioning them for sale to the tier 1 suppliers
to the market. This strategy was demonstrated by the launch of our Redneck Riviera Brand (RRW) in conjunction with our branding
partners
 Sandstrom Partners in 2018. This demonstrated how our team can leverage its position to launch nascent or new brands
and grow them more quickly than the tier 1 larger conglomerates because we are able to focus and dedicate more of our attention
to developing innovative products. Our RRW brand went from idea
 to market roll-out in less than nine months and achieved national
distribution in 49 states in 18 months. In September 2019
 we acquired the Azu&ntilde;ia tequila brand and have begun to distribute
this brand through our national platform.

In
May 2017
 we used our shares to acquire 90% of Big Bottom Distilling
 LLC (&ldquo;BBD&rdquo;)
 known for its award-winning
 super-premium
gins and whiskeys
 and American Single Malt Whiskey. BBD&rsquo;s super-premium spirits give us a presence at the &ldquo;ultra-premium
segment&rdquo; of the market. In December 2018
 we acquired the remaining 10% of BBD. In September 2019
 we also acquired the
high-end
 luxury tequila brand
 Azu&ntilde;ia
 to complement our portfolio and provide us with a larger established brand in the
high-growth tequila category. In addition
 through MotherLode Craft Distillery (&ldquo;MotherLode&rdquo;)
 our wholly-owned subsidiary
acquired in March 2017 and Craft Canning + Bottling
 LLC (formerly known as Craft Canning
 LLC) (&ldquo;Craft Canning&rdquo;)
which we acquired in January 2019
 we provide contract bottling
 canning
 and packaging services for existing and emerging beer
wine and spirits producers. We intend to use our mobile canning operations to profit from the rapid growth in the
canned beverages industry (beer
 wine
 spirit-based RTD&rsquo;s).


    
    


Recent
Developments

Introduction
of new Redneck Riviera Whiskey &ldquo;Granny Rich Reserve&rdquo;. 
 we announced the introduction of its newest
product under the Redneck Riviera trademark - Redneck Riviera Whiskey &ldquo;Granny Rich Reserve&rdquo;. Representing the first
line extension with the Redneck Riviera Brand
 Granny Rich Reserve is a premium priced blend of traditional corn whiskey
 aged
three years or more

Introduction
of new Portland Mule Ready-to-Drink (RTD) Cocktail. 
 we announced our landmark entry into the fast growing
Ready-to-Drink (RTD) market with the introduction of the Portland Mule Ready-to-Drink Cocktail. Portland Mule comes in a 250ml
or 8.4 oz can
 designed by the award-winning design team at Sandstrom Partners
 and has a 10.5% alcohol by volume. In August 2019
we announced the Portland Mule &ndash; Marionberry flavor Ready-to-Drink Cocktail.

Acquisition
of Craft Canning &amp; Bottling &ndash; creates significant increase in canning operations.
 we completed
the acquisition of Portland-based Craft Canning + Bottling (&ldquo;Craft Canning&rdquo;) a leading provider of mobile canning
and bottling services in Oregon

Throughout
2018 and 2019
 Eastside Distilling has transformed from a small regional craft distiller serving the northwest
 principally Oregon
to a tier 2 nationally recognized purveyor of high quality above premium spirit brands throughout the United States with distribution
in the major chains and retail outlets covering 49 states. We grew both organically and through acquisitions as we grew Redneck
Riviera Whiskey from zero at the beginning of 2018 to approximately 27
000 cases for 2019 in less than two years. Additionally
we introduced three brand extensions and completed two acquisitions in 2019
 as we acquired the business of Craft Canning
and the Azu&ntilde;ia tequila brand
 adding growth in spirits and non-spirits sales during 2019.

We
continue to expand our points of distribution to drive continued growth as we now have over 10
000 points of distribution for
Redneck Riviera Whiskey alone
 which we consider to be our gateway to grow our other brands on a national platform. We believe
we are also positioned to simplify our business model and manage both an in-house and outsourced scalable production model and
 tier 2 house of
national brands in the spirits industry with national distribution and a host of brands growing from near zero to in the range
of 100
000 cases annually
 leading to potential opportunities to sell our most mature brands to the tier 1 spirits houses.

On
December 31
 2019
 management made a strategic shift to focus the Company&rsquo;s sale and marketing efforts on the nationally
branded product platform
 resulting in the decision to close all four of its retail stores in the Portland
 Oregon area. This
decision does not meet the criteria for reporting discontinued operations until the retail stores are closed / abandoned
 which
is planned to occur by March 31
 2020. As a result
 the retail operations will not be reported as discontinued operations as of
December 31
 2019. The table below show results of retail operations compared to total company operations for 2019 and 2018.

Our
overall 2019 sales was primarily driven by increases in wholesale sales and co-packing. Wholesale sales increased primarily due
to increased points of distribution of the Redneck Riviera Whiskey products
 which drove brand sales to $3.8 million in 2019
from $2.3 million in 2018
 the acquisition Azu&ntilde;ia tequila brand
 which accounted for a $1.1 million increase over last
year
 as well as continued growth within the Pacific Northwest
 which increased to $3.5 million in 2019 from $3.1 million in 2018.
Our private label sales increased due to the acquisition of Craft Canning and also benefited from our periodic bulk spirit sales
during the year. Finally
 our retail operations experienced a decline due to the decision to discontinue event activities outside
our retail stores during 2019
 with the plan to discontinue all remaining retail store operations by the end of the first quarter
of 2020.

Excise
taxes
 customer programs and incentives for the year ended December 31
 2019 increased to $1.4 million
 or approximately 32%
from $1.1 million for the comparable 2018 period. The increase is attributable to the higher federal excise taxes as a result
of the increase in spirit shipments from our production facility above 100
000 proof gallons
 as well as an increase in
customer programs and incentives due to increased distribution. The customer programs and incentives for Redneck Riviera Whiskey
in 2019 was $0.4 million compared to $0.1 million in 2018 for which 50% of these charges are expected to be reimbursed
upon the eventual sale of the brand by the licensor if the licensing agreement remains in force.

Cost
of sales consists of the costs of ingredients utilized in the production of spirits
 manufacturing labor and overhead
 warehousing
rent
 packaging
 and inbound freight charges. During the year ended December 31
 2019
 cost of sales increased to $10.1 million
or approximately 166%
 from $3.8 million for the year ended December 31
 2018. The increase is attributable to the costs associated
with our increased sales in the period
 as well as higher manufacturing overhead related to increased facilities costs. In addition
during 2019 we wrote-off $0.3 million of obsolete inventory. The cost of sales we reported in both 2019 and 2018
 are based on
small production lots. Our objective is to achieve economies of scale as we continue to scale our operations and therefore drive
improvement in our per unit cost of sales
 which is likely to include expanding our outsourced production.


    
    



Gross
profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of products sold from net sales. Gross margin is gross profits stated as a percentage
of net sales.

The
following table compares our gross profit and gross margin in the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018:

Our
gross margin of 35% of net sales in the year ended December 31
 2019 decreased from our gross margin of 38% for the year ended
December 31
 2018 primarily due to a change in product and services mix
 higher raw material costs
 higher facilities costs due
to the manufacturing footprint relative to current volume
 and obsolete inventory write-off. The gross margin of the Azu&ntilde;ia
tequila products in the fourth quarter was significantly lower than our corporate average for the spirits products and therefore
accounts for 2% of the decline in gross margin from 2018 to 2019. Our goal is to improve our overall gross margin
by increasing the efficiencies of our production facility and evaluate outsourced production as a means to lower cost
of goods sold. As we generate increased volumes
 our margins may continue to fluctuate as a result of other key factors: raw
material costs which tend to fluctuate
 product and service sales mix and the related customer programs and incentives
 which
are subject to seasonal fluctuations and the competitive environments.

Advertising
promotional and selling expenses for the year ended December 31
 2019 increased to $7.5 million or approximately 72% from $4.3
million for the year ended December 31
 2018. This increase is primarily due to our increased sales compensation of $2.9 million
in 2019 from $1.5 million in 2018 as we increased our national sales force and as a result of the Azu&ntilde;ia acquisition.
The advertising
 promotional and selling expenses for Redneck Riviera Whiskey in 2019 was $4.0 million compared to $2.3 in
2018 for which 50% of these charges are expected to be reimbursed upon the eventual sale of the brand by the licensor if
the licensing agreement remains in force.

General
and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31
 2019 increased to $11.5 million
 or approximately 85%
from $6.2 million for the year ended December 31
 2018. This increase is primarily due to increased headcount from the acquisitions
and the associated compensation and benefits
 higher depreciation and amortization from the Craft Canning and Azu&ntilde;ia
acquisitions
 and certain one-time costs related to bonuses paid
 legal expenses
 and acquisition-related expenses.

Total
other expense
 net was $3.2 million for the year ended December 31
 2019
 compared to $0.8 million for the year ended December
31
 2018
 an increase of 306%. This increase was due to revaluation of the Azu&ntilde;ia acquisition partially
offset by a decrease in interest expense.

Net
loss available to common shareholders during the year ended December 31
 2019 was $16.9 million as compared to a loss of
$9.0 million for the year ended December 31
 2018. The increase in our net loss was primarily attributable to our greater operating
expenses as advertising
 promotional and selling expenses grew 72% from the prior year as the promotional expenses to support
Redneck Riviera grew in connection with the growth in national distribution
 and general and administrative expenses grew in both
cash and non-cash expenses as the Azu&ntilde;ia acquisition added amortization of intangibles added to the non-cash expenses and
professional fees added to the cash expenses in 2019. The growth in operating expenses was partially offset by an increase in
gross profit.


    
    


Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Year
Ended December 31
 2019

Our
primary capital requirements are for cash used in operating activities
 the financing of inventories
 and financing acquisitions.
Funds for our cash and liquidity needs have historically not been generated from operations but rather from short-term credit
in the form of extended payment terms from suppliers as well as from convertible debt and equity financings.

For
the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 we incurred net losses of approximately $16.9 million and $9.0 million respectively
and as of December 31
 2019
 we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $44.2 million. We have been dependent on raising
capital from debt and equity financings to meet our needs for cash flow used in operating activities. For the year ended December
31
 2019
 we raised approximately $2.5 million in additional capital through equity and debt financing (net of repayments).
See Notes 10 and 11 to our financial statements for a description of our debt.

At
December 31
 2019
 we had $0.3 million of cash on hand with a positive working capital of $8.3 million. Our ability to
meet our ongoing operating cash needs over the next 12 months depends on reducing our operating costs
 raising additional
debt or equity capital and generating positive operating cash flow
 primarily through increased sales
 improved profit growth
and controlling expenses. We intend to implement actions to improve profitability
 by managing expenses while continuing
to increase sales. Additionally
 we are seeking to leverage our large inventory balances and our accounts receivable
balance to help satisfy its working capital needs over the next 12 months. See Notes 10
 11 and 18 to our financial statements
for a description of our debt and the debt refinancing initiatives completed in the first quarter of 2020. If we are unable to
obtain additional financing
 or additional financing is not available on acceptable terms
 we may seek to sell assets
 reduce
operating expenses or reduce or eliminate marketing initiatives
 and take other measures that could impair our ability to be successful.

Our
cash flow related information for the years 2019 and 2018 is as follows:

Operating
Activities

Total
cash used from operating activities was $9.1 million compared to $13.9 million in 2018. The decrease in cash usage can
be primarily attributed to a $0.3 million decrease in accounts receivable
 and a $1.2 million increase in accounts
payable and accrued liabilities
 partially offset by a $0.4 million inventory build which consisted of an increase of $2.3
million of finished goods inventory
 with $1.1 million of that increase resulting from the Azu&ntilde;ia acquisition
and $1.1 million from our inventory build up to support Redneck Riviera.

In
2018
 the inventory build was $7.0 million which was principally raw spirit inventory. Accounts receivable increased $0.2 million
and a $0.2 million increase in accrued liabilities was partially offset by a $0.7 million increase in accounts payable.

Investing
Activities

Cash
used in investing activities consists primarily of acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment. We incurred capital expenditures
of $3.6 million and $1.3 million in 2019 and 2018
 respectively. The increase in cash usage can largely be attributed to
the $1.5 million Craft Canning acquisition
 net of cash acquired
 in January 2019
 and the further buildout and equipment additions
to our primary production facility in Milwaukie
 Oregon.


    
    


Financing
Activities

Our
operating losses and working capital needs were primarily funded by existing cash on hand and $2.5 million in proceeds
from the issuance of common stock and debt (net of repayments). Net cash flows provided by financing activities during 2018 were
from $8.7 million in proceeds from the sale of common stock
 $3.6 million in proceeds from the issuance of notes
 $2.9 million
net proceeds from the secured credit facility and warrant exercises of $8 million
 partially offset by principal payments on notes
of $0.5 million.

Common
Stock Financings

In
September 2019
 the Company issued 280
555 units (the &ldquo;Units&rdquo;) in a private offering at a per Unit price of $4.50
per share
 resulting in net cash proceeds of $1.3 million. Each Unit consists of one share of the Company&rsquo;s common stock
and a three-year warrant to acquire 0.5 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $5.50 per share.

Promissory
Notes

During
2019
 we executed two promissory notes totaling $0.6 million with a financial institution. The promissory notes bear interest
at 3.91% - 3.96% per annum. The notes have 60-month terms with maturities in August 2024 &ndash; November 2024. Principal and
accrued interest are paid in accordance with monthly amortization schedules. The notes are secured by the assets of Craft Canning.

During
2019
 we executed a promissory note for $0.25 million with a private investor. The promissory note bears interest at 5.0% per
annum. The note matured on December 31
 2019 and is in default. We anticipate the note to be extended until December 31
 2020.

During
2019
 we issued to TQLA a Secured Line of Credit Promissory Note (the &ldquo;TQLA Note&rdquo;) for a revolving line of
credit in the aggregate principal amount of $2.0 million. The TQLA Note was scheduled to mature on April 15
 2020 and may
be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without penalty or premium. As of December 31
 2019
 the Company had borrowed $0.9
million on the TQLA Note. The TQLA Note was repaid in its entirety on January 16
 2019.

Lines
of Credit

During
2019
 we entered into a Factoring Agreement with ENGS Commercial Capital
 LLC that provides for a minimum of $0.5 million purchased
accounts receivable and a maximum of $2.0 million purchased accounts receivable. The advance rate is 85%
 and interest is charged
against the greater of $0.5 million or the total funds advanced at a rate of 5% plus the prime rate published in the Wall Street
Journal. The Company factored $0.7 million of invoices during the year ended December 31
 2019. At December 31
 2019
 the Company
had $0.4 million factored invoices outstanding.

During
2019
 we utilized an existing accounts receivable factoring line of credit with Park Street Financial Services
 LLC. The advance
rate is 75%
 and interest is charged at a rate of 2.4% for the first 30 days plus 1.44% for each additional ten-day period. The
Company factored $1.5 million of invoices during the year ended December 31
 2019. At December 31
 2019
 the Company had $0.1
million factored invoices outstanding.


Inventory
Line

In
January 2020 we and our subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement with Live Oak Banking Company (&ldquo;Live Oak&rdquo;) for
a loan in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the lesser of (i) $8
000
000 and (ii) a borrowing base equal to 85% of the
appraised value of the borrowers&rsquo; eligible inventory of whisky in barrels or totes less an amount equal to all service fees
or rental payments owed by borrowers during the 90 day period immediately succeeding the date of determination to any warehouses
or bailees holding eligible inventory (the &ldquo;Live Oak Loan&rdquo;). The Live Oak Loan is secured by all asset of the Company
excluding accounts receivable and certain other specified excluded property. The Live Oak Loan bears interest at a variable rate
of interest equal to (i) two and 49/100ths percent (2.49%) per annum plus (ii) the Prime Rate as published in The Wall Street
Journal
 adjusted on a calendar quarterly basis. Interest is payable monthly. Additionally
 the Company issued to Live Oak 100
000
warrants to purchase common stock at an initial exercise price of $3.9425 per share. The proceeds of the Live Oak Loan have been
used to pay off all principal and accrued interest under the TQLA Note of $0.9 million and all principal and interest under loan
issued pursuant to that Credit and Security Agreement
 by and between the Company and The KFK Children&rsquo;s Trust
 Jeffrey
Anderson &ndash; Trustee of $3.0 million. As of March 30
 2020
 the balance of the Live Oak Loan is $6.5 million and has been
fully drawn upon.


Critical
Accounting Policies

The
discussion and analysis of the Company&rsquo;s financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial
statements
 which have been prepared in accordance with United States. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation
of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets
liabilities
 revenues and expenses
 and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These items are monitored and
analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances
 and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future.
The more judgmental estimates are summarized below. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known.
The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under
the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be
substantially accurate.


    
    


Revenue
Recognition

Net
sales includes product sales
 less excise taxes and customer programs and incentives. The Company recognizes revenue by applying

Contracts with Customers
(3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5)
recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied.

The
Company recognizes sales when merchandise is shipped from a warehouse directly to wholesale customers (except in the case of a
consignment sale). For consignment sales
 which include sales to the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC)
 the Company recognizes
sales upon the consignee&rsquo;s shipment to the customer. Postage and handling charges billed to customers are also recognized
as sales upon shipment of the related merchandise. Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point
 and title passes to the customer
at the time and place of shipment or purchase by customers at a retail location. For consignment sales
 title passes to the consignee
concurrent with the consignee&rsquo;s shipment to the customer. The customer has no cancellation privileges after shipment or
upon purchase at retail locations
 other than customary rights of return. The Company excludes sales tax collected and remitted
to various states from sales and cost of sales. Sales from items sold through the Company&rsquo;s retail locations are recognized
at the time of sale.

Sales
received from online merchants who sell discounted gift certificates for the Company&rsquo;s merchandise and tastings is deferred
until the customer has redeemed the discounted gift certificate or the gift certificate has expired
 whichever occurs earlier.

Customer
Programs and Incentives

Customer
programs and incentives
 which include customer promotional discount programs
 customer incentives and other payments
 are a common
practice in the alcoholic beverage industry. The Company makes these payments to customers and incurs these costs to promote sales
of products and to maintain competitive pricing. Amounts paid in connection with customer programs and incentives are recorded
as reductions to net sales or as advertising

with Customers

2019 and 2018
 respectively. The customer programs and incentives for Redneck Riviera Whiskey in 2019 were $0.4 million
 compared
to $0.1 million in 2018
 for which 50% of these charges are expected to be reimbursed upon the eventual sale of the brand by the
licensor while the licensing agreement is in effect.

promotional and selling expense was $7.5 million and $4.3 million in 2019 and 2018
 respectively. The advertising
 promotional
and selling expense for Redneck Riviera Whiskey in 2019 was $4.0 million compared to $2.3 in 2018 for which 50% of these charges
are expected to be reimbursed upon the eventual sale of the brand by the licensor while the licensing agreement is in effect.

Shipping
and Fulfillment Costs

Freight
costs incurred related to shipment of merchandise from the Company&rsquo;s distribution facilities to customers are recorded in
cost of sales.


    
    


Cash
and Cash Equivalents

Cash
equivalents are considered to be highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of the purchase.
The Company had no cash equivalents at December 31
 2019 and December 31
 2018.



Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade receivables. At
December 31
 2019
 two distributors represented 40% of trade receivables. At December 31
 2018
 two distributors
represented 37% of trade receivables. Sales to one distributor accounted for 16% of consolidated sales for the year ended
December 31
 2019. Sales to two distributors accounted for 42% of consolidated sales for the year ended December 31
 2018.



Inventories
primarily consist of bulk spirits
 packaging supplies
 and finished goods which are stated at the lower of cost or market.
Cost is determined using an average costing methodology
 which approximates cost under the first-in
 first-out (FIFO) method.
A portion of our finished goods inventory is held by certain independent distributors on consignment until it is sold to
a third party. The Company regularly monitors inventory quantities on hand and records write-downs for excess and obsolete inventories
based primarily on the Company&rsquo;s estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements. Such write-downs establish
a new cost basis of accounting for the related inventory. The Company has recorded write-downs of inventory of $0.3 million and
$Nil for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.

Excise
Taxes

The
Company is responsible for compliance with the Alcohol
 Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (&ldquo;TTB&rdquo;) regulations
 which includes
making timely and accurate excise tax payments. The Company is subject to periodic compliance audits by the TTB. Individual states
also impose excise taxes on alcoholic beverages in varying amounts. The Company calculates its excise tax expense based upon units
produced and on its understanding of the applicable excise tax laws. Excise taxes totaled $0.8 million and $0.7 million in 2019
and 2018
 respectively.

Stock-Based
Compensation

The
Company recognizes as compensation expense all stock-based awards issued to employees. The compensation cost is measured based
on the grant-date fair value of the related stock-based awards and is recognized over the service period of stock-based awards
which is generally the same as the vesting period. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation
model
 which estimates the fair value of each award on the date of grant based on a variety of assumptions including expected
stock price volatility
 expected terms of the awards
 risk-free interest rate
 and dividend rates
 if applicable. Stock-based
awards issued to nonemployees are recorded at fair value on the measurement date and are subject to periodic market adjustments
at the end of each reporting period and as the underlying stock-based awards vest. Net stock-based compensation was $0.7
million and $0.7 million in 2019 and 2018
 respectively.

Going
Concern

Although
our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31
 2019 were prepared under the assumption that we would continue
our operations as a going concern
 the report of our independent registered public accounting firm that accompanies our financial
statements for the year ended December 31
 2019 contains a going concern qualification in which such firm expressed substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern
 based on the financial statements at that time. Specifically
 as noted
above
 we have incurred operating losses since our inception
 and even though we have reduced our operating expenses and increased
our available capacity under our lines of credit
 and have large inventory balances to drawn from
 we expect to continue to incur
significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. These prior losses and expected future losses have had
and will continue to have
 an adverse effect on our financial condition. If we cannot continue as a going concern
 our stockholders
would likely lose most or all of their investment in us.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial
condition
 changes in financial condition
 revenues or expenses
 results of operations
 liquidity
 capital expenditures or capital
resources.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and
Stockholders
of Eastside Distilling
 Inc.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Eastside Distilling
 Inc. (the Company) as of December 31
 2019 and
2018
 and the related consolidated statements of operations
 stockholders&rsquo; equity
 and cash flows for each of the years
in the two-year period ended December 31
 2019
 and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial
statements). In our opinion
 the financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial position of the
Company as of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year
period ended December 31
 2019
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis
for Opinion

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company&rsquo;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error
or fraud. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits
 we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
 but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly
 we express no such opinion.

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to
error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the financial statements
 the Company suffered a net loss from operations and has a net capital deficiency
 which
raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans regarding those matters are also
described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this.

Operating
as a small business in a large
 international spirits marketplace occupied by large multi-national conglomerates
 we seek to utilize
our size and our public company stature to our advantage and position Eastside Distilling as a leading tier 2 spirits provider
by acquiring and developing brands
 growing them to a national presence and positioning them for sale to the tier 1 suppliers
to the market. This strategy was demonstrated by the launch of our Redneck Riviera Brand (RRW) in conjunction with our branding
partners
 Sandstrom Partners in 2018. This demonstrated how our team can leverage its position to launch nascent or new brands
and grow them more quickly than the tier 1 larger conglomerates because we are able to focus and dedicate more of our attention to developing innovative products. Our RRW brand went from idea
 to market roll-out in less than nine months and
achieved national distribution in 49 states in 18 months. In September 2019
 we acquired the Azu&ntilde;ia tequila brand and
have begun to distribute this brand through our national platform.

In
May 2017
 we used our shares to acquire 90% of Big Bottom Distilling
 LLC (&ldquo;BBD&rdquo;)
 known for its award-winning
 super-premium
gins and whiskeys
 and American Single Malt Whiskey. BBD&rsquo;s super-premium spirits give us a presence at the &ldquo;ultra-premium
segment&rdquo; of the market. In December 2018
 we acquired the remaining 10% of BBD. In September 2019
 we also acquired the
high-end
 luxury tequila brand
 Azu&ntilde;ia
 to complement our portfolio and provide us with a larger established brand in the
high-growth tequila category. In addition
 through MotherLode Craft Distillery (&ldquo;MotherLode&rdquo;)
 our wholly-owned subsidiary
acquired in March 2017 and Craft Canning + Bottling
 LLC (formerly known as Craft Canning
 LLC) (&ldquo;Craft Canning&rdquo;)
which we acquired in January 2019
 we provide contract bottling
 canning
 and packaging services for existing and emerging beer
wine and spirits producers. We have used our mobile canning operations to profit from the rapid growth in
the canned beverages industry (beer
 wine
 spirit-based RTD&rsquo;s).

2.
Liquidity 

Historically
the Company has funded its cash and liquidity needs through operating cash flow convertible notes
 extended credit terms
and equity financings. For the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company incurred a net loss of approximately $16.9
million and $9.0 million
 respectively
 and has an accumulated deficit of approximately $44.2 million as of December
31
 2019. The Company has been dependent on raising capital from debt and equity financings to meet its needs for cash flow used
in operating activities. For the year ended December 31
 2019
 we raised approximately $2.5 million in additional capital
through equity and debt financing (net of repayments).

At
December 31
 2019
 we had $0.3 million of cash on hand with a positive working capital of $8.3 million. Our ability to meet our
ongoing operating cash needs over the next 12 months depends on reducing our operating costs
 raising additional debt or equity
capital and generating positive operating cash flow
 primarily through increased sales
 improved profit growth and controlling
expenses. We intend to implement actions to improve profitability
 by managing expenses while continuing to increase sales. Additionally
we are seeking to leverage our large inventory balances and our accounts receivable balance to help satisfy its working capital
needs over the next 12 months. See Notes 10
 11 and 18 to our financial statements for a description of our debt and the debt
refinancing initiatives completed in the first quarter of 2020. If we are unable to obtain additional financing
 or additional
financing is not available on acceptable terms
 we may seek to sell assets
 reduce operating expenses or reduce or eliminate marketing
initiatives
 and take other measures that could impair our ability to be successful.


for the year ended December 31
 2019 were prepared under the assumption that we would continue our operations as a going concern
the report of our independent registered public accounting firm that accompanies our financial statements for the year ended December
31
 2019 contains a going concern qualification in which such firm expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as
a going concern
 based on the financial statements at that time. Specifically
 as noted above
 we have incurred operating losses
since our inception
 and even though we have reduced our operating expenses and increased our available capacity under our lines
of credit
 and have large inventory balances to drawn from
 we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating
losses for the foreseeable future. These prior losses and expected future losses have had
 and will continue to have
 an adverse
effect on our financial condition. If we cannot continue as a going concern
 our stockholders would likely lose most or all of
their investment in us.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis
of Presentation and Consolidation

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements for Eastside Distilling
 Inc. and subsidiaries were prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Eastside Distilling
 Inc.&rsquo;s wholly-owned subsidiaries
 including
 MotherLode
 BBD
 Outlandish
 LLC
 Redneck
Riviera Whiskey Co.
 LLC
 Craft Canning (beginning as of January 11
 2019) and the Azu&ntilde;ia tequila assets (beginning September
12
 2019). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Segment
Reporting

The
Company determined its operating segment on the same basis that it uses to evaluate its performance internally. The Company has
one business activity
 packaging
 producing
 marketing and distributing alcoholic beverages and operates as one segment. The Company&rsquo;s
chief operating decision makers
 its chief executive officer
 president and chief financial officer
 review the Company&rsquo;s
operating results on an aggregate basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Revenue
Recognition

Net
sales includes product sales
 less excise taxes and customer programs and incentives. The Company recognizes revenue by applying

Contracts with Customers
(3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5)
recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied.

The
Company recognizes sales when merchandise is shipped from a warehouse directly to wholesale customers (except in the case of a
consignment sale). For consignment sales
 which include sales to the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC)
 the Company recognizes
sales upon the consignee&rsquo;s shipment to the customer. Postage and handling charges billed to customers are also recognized
as sales upon shipment of the related merchandise. Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point
 and title passes to the customer
at the time and place of shipment or purchase by customers at a retail location. For consignment sales
 title passes to the consignee
concurrent with the consignee&rsquo;s shipment to the customer. The customer has no cancellation privileges after shipment or
upon purchase at retail locations
 other than customary rights of return. The Company excludes sales tax collected and remitted
to various states from sales and cost of sales. Sales from items sold through the Company&rsquo;s retail locations are recognized
at the time of sale.

Revenue
received from online merchants who sell discounted gift certificates for the Company&rsquo;s merchandise and tastings at its tasting
rooms
 is deferred until the customer has redeemed the discounted gift certificate or the gift certificate has expired
 whichever
occurs earlier.

Customer
Programs and Incentives


 which include
customer promotional discount programs
 customer incentives and other payments
 are a common practice in the alcoholic beverage
industry. The Company makes these payments to customers and incurs these costs to promote sales of products and to maintain competitive
pricing. Amounts paid in connection with customer programs and incentives are recorded as reductions to net sales or as advertising


of the expenditure. Amounts paid to customers totaled $0.6 million and $0.4 million in years 2019 and 2018
 respectively
 of which
$0.4 million compared to $0.1 million in 2018 are included in the 50% Redneck Riviera Whiskey Marketing reimbursement and
are expected to be collected upon the sale of the Redneck Riviera Brand by the licensor if sold while the licensing agreement
is in effect. The reimbursement is payable upon the sale of the brand within the term of the agreement
 which is 10 years
with a renewable option for any additional 10 years
 by the licensor.

Advertising
Promotional and Selling Expenses


promotional and selling expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations: media advertising costs
 special event
costs
 tasting room costs
 sales and marketing expenses
 promotional costs of value added packaging
 salary and benefit expenses
travel and entertainment expenses for the sales

50% Redneck Riviera Whiskey Marketing reimbursement and are expected to be collected upon the sale of the Redneck Riviera
Brand by the licensor if sold while the licensing agreement is in effect. The reimbursement is payable upon the sale
of the brand within the term of the agreement
 which is 10 years
 with a renewable option for any additional 10 years
 by the
licensor.

Cost
of Sales

Cost
of sales consists of the costs of ingredients utilized in the production of spirits
 manufacturing labor and overhead
 warehousing
rent
 packaging
 and in-bound freight charges. Ingredients account for the largest portion of the cost of sales
 followed by packaging
and production costs.

Shipping
and Fulfillment Costs

Freight
costs incurred related to shipment of merchandise from the Company&rsquo;s distribution facilities to customers are recorded in
cost of sales.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

Cash
equivalents are considered to be highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of the purchase.
The Company had no cash equivalents at December 31
 2019 and 2018.



Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade receivables. At
December 31
 2019
 two distributors represented 40% of trade receivables. At December 31
 2018
 two distributors represented 37%
of trade receivables. Sales to one distributor accounted for 16% of consolidated sales for the year ended December 31
2019. Sales to two distributors accounted for 42% of consolidated sales for the year ended December 31
 2018.

Fair
Value Measurements

GAAP
defines fair value
 establishes a framework for measuring fair value
 and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements.
GAAP permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and contains financial
statement presentation and disclosure requirements for assets and liabilities for which the fair value option is elected. At December
31
 2019 and December 31
 2018
 management has not elected to report any of the Company&rsquo;s assets or liabilities at fair
value under the &ldquo;fair value option&rdquo; provided by GAAP.

The
hierarchy of fair value valuation techniques under GAAP provides for three levels: Level 1 provides the most reliable measure
of fair value
 whereas Level 3
 if applicable
 generally would require significant management judgment. The three levels for categorizing
assets and liabilities under GAAP&rsquo;s fair value measurement requirements are as follows:



    
Level
    1:
Fair
    value of the asset or liability is determined using cash or unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
    or liabilities.

    
    
    

    
Level
    2:
Fair
    value of the asset or liability is determined using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the applicable
    asset or liability
 either directly or indirectly
 such as quoted prices for similar (as opposed to identical) assets or liabilities
    in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.

    
    
    

    
Level
    3:
Fair
    value of the asset or liability is determined using unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement
    and reflect management&rsquo;s own assumptions regarding the applicable asset or liability.


None
of the Company&rsquo;s assets or liabilities were measured at fair value at December 31
 2019 or 2018. However
 GAAP requires
the disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments that are not measured at fair value. Financial instruments
consist principally of trade receivables
 accounts payable
 accrued liabilities
 note payable
 and convertible note payable. The
estimated fair value of trade receivables
 accounts payable
 and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to
the short period of time to their maturities. At December 31
 2019 and December 31
 2018
 the Company&rsquo;s notes are payable
at fixed rates and their carrying value approximates fair value.

Items
Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Certain
assets and liabilities acquired in a business acquisition are valued at fair value at the date of acquisition.

Years

Inventories
primarily consist of bulk and bottled liquor and merchandise and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
using an average costing methodology
 which approximates cost under the first-in
 first-out (FIFO) method. A portion of inventory
is held by certain independent distributors on consignment until it is sold to a third party. The Company regularly monitors inventory
quantities on hand and records write-downs for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on the Company&rsquo;s estimated
forecast of product demand and production requirements. Such write-downs establish a new cost basis of accounting for the related
inventory. The Company recorded write-downs of inventory of $0.3 million and $Nil for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
respectively.

Property
and Equipment

Property
and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets
 ranging from three to seven years. Amortization of leasehold improvements
is computed using the straight-line method over the life of the lease or the useful lives of the assets
 whichever is shorter.
The cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization of property and equipment sold or otherwise disposed of are removed
from the accounts and any gain or loss is reported as current period income or expense. The costs of repairs and maintenance are
expensed as incurred.

Intangible
Assets / Goodwill

The
Company accounts for long-lived assets
 including property and equipment and intangible assets
 at amortized cost. Management
reviews long-lived assets for probable impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets
may not be recoverable. If there is an indication of impairment
 management would prepare an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted
and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these estimated cash
flows were less than the carrying amount
 an impairment loss would be recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair
value. The Company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill at December 31
 2019 and determined that goodwill was not impaired.

Long-lived
Assets

The
Company accounts for long-lived assets
 including property and equipment
 at amortized cost. Management reviews long-lived assets
for probable impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
If there is an indication of impairment
 management would prepare an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest
charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these estimated cash flows were less than
the carrying amount of the asset
 an impairment loss would be recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value.

Income
Taxes

The
provision for income taxes is based on income and expenses as reported for financial statement purposes using the &ldquo;asset
and liability method&rdquo; for accounting for deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable
to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled.

As
changes in tax laws or rates are enacted
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes.
A valuation allowance
 if needed
 reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. At December 31
 2019 and
2018
 the Company established valuation allowances against its net deferred tax assets.

Income
tax positions that meet the &ldquo;more-likely-than-not&rdquo; recognition threshold are measured at the largest amount of income
tax benefit that is more than 50 % likely to be realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of
the benefits associated with income tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above would be reflected
as a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets along with any associated
interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Interest and penalties associated with
unrecognized income tax benefits would be classified as additional income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations. There were no unrecognized income tax benefits
 nor any interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income
tax benefits
 accrued or expensed at and for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018.

The
Company files federal income tax returns in the United States. and various state income tax returns. The Company is no longer
subject to examinations by the related tax authorities for the Company&rsquo;s U.S. federal and state income tax returns for years
prior to 2012.

Comprehensive
Income

The
Company does not have any reconciling other comprehensive income items for the for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
respectively.

Excise
Taxes

The
Company is responsible for compliance with the TTB regulations
 which includes making timely and accurate excise tax payments.
The Company is subject to periodic compliance audits by the TTB. Individual states also impose excise taxes on alcoholic beverages
in varying amounts. The Company calculates its excise tax expense based upon units produced and on its understanding of the applicable
excise tax laws. Excise taxes totaled $0.8 million and $0.7 million in years 2019 and 2018
 respectively.

Stock-Based
Compensation

The
Company recognizes as compensation expense all stock-based awards issued to employees. The compensation cost is measured based
on the grant-date fair value of the related stock-based awards and is recognized over the service period of stock-based awards
which is generally the same as the vesting period. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation
model
 which estimates the fair value of each award on the date of grant based on a variety of assumptions including expected
stock price volatility
 expected terms of the awards
 risk-free interest rate
 and dividend rates
 if applicable. Stock-based
awards issued to nonemployees are recorded at fair value on the measurement date and are subject to periodic market adjustments
at the end of each reporting period and as the underlying stock-based awards vest. Stock-based compensation was $0.7 million
and $0.7 million in fiscal years 2019 and 2018
 respectively.

Accounts
Receivable Factoring Program

The
Company has entered into two accounts receivable factoring programs. One for its spirits customers (the &ldquo;spirits program&rdquo;)
and another for its co-packing customers (the &ldquo;co-packing program&rdquo;). Under the programs
 the Company has the option
to sell certain customer account receivables in advance of payment for 75% (spirits program) or 85% (co-packing program) of the
amount due. When the customer remits payment
 the Company receives the remaining balance. For the spirits program
 interest is
charged on the advanced 75% payment at a rate of 2.4% for the first 30 days plus 1.44% for each additional ten-day period. For
the co-packing program
 interest is charged against the greater of $500
000 or the total funds advanced at a rate of 5% plus the
prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal. Under the terms of both agreements
 the factoring provider has full recourse
against the Company should the customer fail to pay the invoice. In accordance with ASC 860
 we have concluded that these agreements
have met all three conditions identified in ASC 860-10-40-5 (a) &ndash; (c) and have accounted for this activity as a sale. Given
the quality of the factored accounts
 the Company has not recognized a recourse obligation. In certain limited instances
 the
Company may provide collection services on the factored accounts but does not receive any fees for acting as the collection agent
and as such
 the Company has not recognized a service obligation asset or liability. The Company factored $2.2 million of invoices
and incurred $0.1 million in fees associated with the factoring programs during the year ended December 31
 2019. At December
31
 2019
 the Company had $0.6 million factored invoices outstanding.

Discontinued
Operations

The
Company reports discontinued operations by applying the following criteria in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
: (1) Component
of an entity; (2) Held for sale criteria; (3) Strategic shift. On December 31
 2019
 management made a strategic shift to focus
the Company&rsquo;s sale and marketing efforts on the nationally branded product platform
 resulting in the decision to close
all four of its retail stores in the Portland
 Oregon area. Although this decision meets the criteria (1) and (3) for reporting
discontinued operations
 it does not meet the (2) Held for sale criteria until the retail stores are closed / abandoned
 which
is planned to occur by March 31
 2020. As a result
 the retail operations will not be reported as discontinued operations as of
December 31
 2019.

Recently
Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In
August 2016

2016-15
 Statement of Cash Flows &ndash; Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments 

 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash
The new standards are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017
 and interim periods within those fiscal years
and amend the existing accounting standards for the statement of cash flows. The amendments provide guidance on the following
nine cash flow issues: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon or other debt instruments with
coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration
payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of
corporate-owned life insurance policies; distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization
transactions; separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle; and restricted cash. The adoption
of ASU 2016-15 and ASU 2016-18 on January 1
 2018 did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

In
May 2014
 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09
 which superseded virtually all existing revenue guidance. Under this update
 an entity
is required to recognize revenue upon transfer of promised goods or services to customers
 in an amount that reflects the expected
consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. As such
 an entity will need to use more judgment and make more
estimates than under the current guidance. ASU 2014-09 is to be applied retrospectively either to each prior reporting period
presented in the financial statements
 or only to the most current reporting period presented in the financial statements with
a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings. The Company elected to apply ASU 2014-09 with a cumulative effect adjustment
to retained earnings. In August 2015
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14

of the Effective Date 
 making
it effective for the year beginning December 31
 2017
 with early adoption permitted as of January 1
 2017. The Company adopted
ASU 2014-09 as of January 1
 2018. The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2014-09 had any material impact on its consolidated
financial statements.

Ended December 31

In
February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 Under the new guidance
lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement
date:



    
    
A
    lease liability
 which is a lessee&rsquo;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
 measured on a discounted
    basis; and

    
    
    

    
    
A
    right-of-use asset
 which is an asset that represents the lessee&rsquo;s right to use
 or control the use of
 a specified
    asset for the lease term.


Under
the new guidance
 lessor accounting will be largely unchanged. Certain targeted improvements were made to align
 where necessary
lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and ASU No. 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The new lease guidance
simplified the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease
liabilities. Lessees will no longer be provided with a source of off-balance sheet financing. Public business entities should
apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those
fiscal years (i.e.
 January 1
 2019
 for a calendar year entity). Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for
sales-type
 direct financing
 and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing
at
 or entered into after
 the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified
retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period
presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. In July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-11
This guidance provides an additional (and optional) transition method whereby the new lease standard
is applied at the adoption date and recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings. In addition
 this ASU provides a practical
expedient
 by class of underlying asset
 to not separate nonlease components from the associated lease and instead account for
the lease as a single component if both the timing and pattern of transfer of the nonlease component(s) are the same
 and if the
lease would be classified as an operating lease. These amendments have the same effective date as ASU 2016-02. On January 1
 2019
the Company adopted the new accounting standard using the modified retrospective approach and elected to not adjust comparative
periods. Upon adoption
 the Company recognized right-of-use assets of $0.9 million
 lease liabilities of $1.1 million
 and a net
adjustment to retained earnings of $0.2 million. The Company considers the impact of the adoption to be immaterial to its consolidated
financial statements on an ongoing basis.

In
June 2018
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07

Share-Based Payment Accounting
 which aligns the accounting for share-based payment awards issued
to employees and nonemployees. Under ASU 2018-07
 the existing employee guidance will apply to nonemployee share-based transactions
(as long as the transaction is not effectively a form of financing)
 with the exception of specific guidance related to the attribution
of compensation cost. The cost of nonemployee awards will continue to be recorded as if the grantor had paid cash for the goods
or services. In addition
 the contractual term will be able to be used in lieu of an expected term in the option-pricing model
for nonemployee awards. The new standard became effective on January 1
 2019 and should be applied to all new awards granted after
the date of adoption. The Company adopted ASU 2018-07 as of January 1
 2019. The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU
2018-07 had any material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In
January 2017
 the FASB issued ASU 2017-04

Impairment
2 from the goodwill impairment test. Current guidance requires that companies compute the implied fair value of goodwill under
Step 2 by performing procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities following
the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
ASU 2017-04 will require companies to perform annual or interim goodwill impairment tests by comparing the fair value of a reporting
unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting
unit&rsquo;s fair value. However
 the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting
unit. ASU 2017-04 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 including interim periods within those
fiscal years
 and will be applied prospectively. Early adoption of this standard is permitted. The Company is currently in the
process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2017-04 on its consolidated financial statements.

Business Acquisitions

During
the fiscal year 2019
 the Company completed the following acquisitions:

Craft
Canning + Bottling

On
January 11
 2019
 the Company completed the acquisition of Craft Canning + Bottling
 LLC (&ldquo;Craft Canning&rdquo;)
 a Portland
Oregon-based provider of bottling and canning services. The Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31
 2019 include Craft Canning&rsquo;s results of operations from the acquisition date of January 11
 2019 through December
31
 2019. The Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements reflect the final purchase accounting adjustments in accordance
with ASC 805 &ldquo;Business Combinations&rdquo;
 whereby the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based upon their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.

The

Intangible
assets are recorded at estimated fair value
 as determined by management based on available information. The fair value assigned
to the customer list intangible asset was determined through the use of the income approach
 specifically the relief from royalty
and the multi-period excess earning methods. The major assumptions used in arriving at the estimated identifiable intangible asset
value included management&rsquo;s estimates of future cash flows
 discounted at an appropriate rate of return which is based on
the weighted average cost of capital for both the Company and other market participants
 projected customer attrition rates
 as
well as applicable royalty rates for comparable assets. The useful lives for intangible assets were determined based upon the
remaining useful economic lives of the tangible assets that are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows.
The customer relationships estimated useful life is seven years.

The
Company incurred Craft Canning-related acquisition costs of $0.1 million during the year ended December 31
 2019 that have been
recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. The results of the Craft Canning
acquisition are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition through December 31
 2019. The
sales and net income (including transaction costs) of Craft Canning operations included in our consolidated statements of operations
were $7.1 million and $0.4 million
 for the period from January 11
 2019 through December 31
 2019.

Azu&ntilde;ia
Tequila

On
September 12
 2019
 the Company completed the acquisition of the Azu&ntilde;ia Tequila brand
 the direct sales team
 existing
product inventory
 supply chain relationships and contractual agreements from Intersect Beverage
 LLC
 an importer and distributor
of tequila and related products. The Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31
2019 include the Azu&ntilde;ia Tequila assets and results of operations. For the year ended December 31
 2019
 the Azu&ntilde;ia
Tequila results of operations are included from the acquisition date of September 12
 2019 through December 31
 2019.

The
acquisition was structured as an all-stock transaction
 provided that the Company may
 at its election
 pay a portion of the consideration
in cash or by executing a three-year promissory note if the issuance of stock would require the Company to hold a vote of its
stockholders under the applicable Nasdaq rules. Subject to compliance with applicable Nasdaq rules
 the initial consideration
will be payable approximately 18 months following the closing and will consist of 850
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common
stock at a stipulated value of $6.00 per share
 350
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock based on the Company&rsquo;s
stock price twelve months after the close of the transaction
 and additional shares based on the Azu&ntilde;ia business achieving
certain revenue targets and the Company&rsquo;s stock price 18 months after the close of the transaction. The Company has also
agreed to issue additional stock consideration (subject to compliance with applicable Nasdaq rules) of up to $1.5 million upon
the Azu&ntilde;ia business achieving revenue of at least $9.45 million in the period commencing on the 13th month following the
closing and ending on the 24th month following the closing.

The
Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements reflect the final purchase accounting adjustments in accordance with ASC 805
&ldquo;Business Combinations&rdquo;
 whereby the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired based upon their estimated
fair values on the acquisition date. The Company estimated the purchase price based on weighted probabilities of future results
and recorded deferred consideration payable of $12.8 million on the acquisition date that will be remeasured to fair value at
each reporting date until the contingencies are resolved
 with the changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The Company remeasured
the deferred consideration payable for the period ended December 31
 2019 and increased the liability by $2.7 million to a balance
of $15.5 million.

of annual sales and dollars per case sold. The Company used an estimated brand useful life of seven years for these accounting
purposes.

The

Leases

The
Company has various lease agreements in place for facilities and equipment. Terms of these leases include
 in some instances
scheduled rent increases
 renewals
 purchase options and maintenance costs
 and vary by lease. These lease obligations expire
at various dates through 2023. As the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable
 the Company uses its incremental
borrowing rate based on information available at commencement to determine the present value of the lease payments. Based on the
present value of the lease payments for the remaining lease term of the Company&rsquo;s existing leases
 the Company recognized
right-of-use assets of $0.9 million
 lease liabilities of $1.1 million
 and a net adjustment to retained earnings of $0.2 million
upon adoption on January 1
 2019. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities commencing after January 1
 2019 are recognized at
commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As of December 31
 2019
 the right-of-use
assets and lease liabilities were $0.7 million and $0.9 million
 respectively. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less
(&ldquo;short-term leases&rdquo;) are not recorded on the balance sheet and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease
term. Aggregate lease expense for the year ended December 31
 2019 was $0.9 million
 consisting of $0.6 million in lease expense
for lease liabilities recorded on the Company&rsquo;s balance sheet and $0.3 million in short-term lease expense.

Secured Credit Facility

On
May 10
 2018
 the Company entered into a credit and security agreement (the &ldquo;Credit and Security Agreement&rdquo;)
 by and
between the Company and The KFK Children&rsquo;s Trust
 Jeffrey Anderson &ndash; Trustee (the &ldquo;Lender&rdquo;). Pursuant
to the Credit and Security Agreement
 the Lender will make loans to the Company in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed
$3
000
000 (the &ldquo;Loans&rdquo;). The Loans are secured by all of the Company&rsquo;s bulk whiskey
 bourbon and rye inventory
held in third-party storage facilities (&ldquo;Specified Inventory&rdquo;). The Company may borrow 80% of the value of the Specified
Inventory it is able to purchase under the Credit and Security Agreement.

The
proceeds of the Loans are to be used by the Company to purchase the Specified Inventory for use in distilling and producing its
spirits products
 and for no other purpose.

The
Loans have an annual interest rate of 7.00%. The Company will pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Loans
 for the period commencing
on the date each such Loan is made and continuing until each such Loan is paid in full. During 2019
 The Company paid $0.2 million
in interest on the Loans. The Company must pay the outstanding principal amount of the Loans in a one-time payment on the termination
date of the Credit and Security Agreement (June 10
 2021)
 or earlier pursuant to other provisions thereof. The Company may prepay
the Loans or any portion thereof at any time
 and from time to time
 without premium or penalty. As of December 31
 2019
 the
Company has borrowed the full $3 million available under the agreement. The Loans were paid in full on January 30
 2020.

The
current market value of the Company&rsquo;s bulk whiskey
 bourbon and rye inventories must be at least 120% of the outstanding
Loan balance. In addition
 the Credit and Security Agreement contains other customary covenants including
 among other things
certain restrictions on incurring indebtedness.

12.
Income Taxes

The
provision for income taxes results in effective tax rates which are different than the federal income tax statutory rate. The
provision (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018 were as follows
 assuming a 21% federal effective
tax rate. The Company also has a state tax rate for Oregon
 of 6.6% for both December 31
 2019 and 2018.

At
December 31
 2019
 the Company has a cumulative net operating loss carryforward (NOL) of approximately $37.8 million
 to offset
against future income for federal and state tax purposes. These federal and state NOLs can be carried forward for 20 and 15 years
respectively. The federal NOLs begin to expire in 2034
 and the state NOLs begin to expire in 2029. The utilization of the net
operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to ownership change provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended
 the Internal Revenue Code) and similar state provisions. In general
 if the Company experiences
a greater than 50 percentage aggregate change in ownership of certain significant stockholders over a three-year period (a &ldquo;Section
382 ownership change&rdquo;)
 utilization of its pre-change NOL carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under Section
382 of the Internal Revenue Code (and similar state laws). The annual limitation generally is determined by multiplying the value
of the Company&rsquo;s stock at the time of such ownership change (subject to certain adjustments) by the applicable long-term
tax-exempt rate. Such limitations may result in expiration of a portion of the NOL carryforwards before utilization and may be
substantial.

In
assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets
 management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generation
of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Due to the uncertainty of
the realizability of the deferred tax assets
 management has determined a full valuation allowance is appropriate.

Legal
Matters

We
are party to the material legal proceeding described below. In addition
 we could be subject to legal proceedings and claims from
time to time in the ordinary course of our business
 or legal proceedings we considered immaterial may in the future become material.
Regardless of the outcome
 litigation can
 among other things
 be time consuming and expensive to resolve
 and divert management
resources.

On
October 22
 2019
 a complaint was filed against the Company in the Circuit Court of Oregon
 County of Multnomah by two former
employees
 Laurie Branch and Justina Thoreson. The complaint also named as defendants certain current and former officers and

 Inc. et al.
 case number
19-CV-45716
 and alleged
 among other things
 that the Company and certain current and former officers and
employees engaged in sex discrimination
 retaliation for reporting sexual discrimination
 sexual harassment
 and aiding and
abetting unlawful discrimination. As relief
 the complaint sought
 among other things
 monetary damages of up to
$560
000 and attorneys and experts&rsquo; fees. This litigation was successfully mediated on March 20
 2020 and is in
final stages of settlement. The Company&rsquo;s insurer accepted initial defense of this matter
 with a reservation of
rights. The Company is responsible for $100
000 retention per claim.

Net Loss per Common Share

Basic
loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period
 without considering any dilutive items. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the sum
of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and the potential number of any dilutive common shares outstanding
during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of the incremental common stock issuable upon exercise of stock options
and convertible notes. Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive. There
were no dilutive common shares at December 31
 2019 and 2018. The numerators and denominators used in computing basic and diluted
net loss per common share in 2019 and 2018 are as follows:

The
aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding at December 31
 2019 was $Nil
 compared to $558
278 at December 31
 2018.

At
December 31
 2019
 there were 227
681 unvested options with an aggregate grant date fair value of $582
209. The unvested options
will vest in accordance with the vesting schedule in each respective option agreement
 which varies between immediate and five
(5) years from the grant date. The aggregate intrinsic value of unvested options at December 31
 2019 was $Nil. During the year
ended December 31
 2019
 193
072 options vested.

The
Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to measure the grant-date fair value of stock options. The grant-date fair value
of stock options issued to employees is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Stock-based awards
issued to nonemployees are recorded at fair value on the measurement date and are subject to periodic market adjustments as the
underlying stock-based awards vest.

To
determine the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model
 the calculation takes into consideration the
effect of the following:



    
    
Exercise
    price of the option

    
    
Fair
    value of the Company&rsquo;s common stock on the date of grant

    
    
Expected
    term of the option

    
    
Expected
    volatility over the expected term of the option

    
    
Risk-free
    interest rate for the expected term of the option


The
calculation includes several assumptions that require management&rsquo;s judgment. The expected term of the options is calculated
using the simplified method described in GAAP. The simplified method defines the expected term as the average of the contractual
term and the vesting period. Estimated volatility is derived from volatility calculated using historical closing prices of common
shares of similar entities whose share prices are publicly available for the expected term of the options. The risk-free interest
rate is based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturities in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the options.

The
following weighted-average assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes valuation model for options granted during the year ended
December 31
 2019:



    
    

    
    

    
    

    
    


The
weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of stock options granted during the year ended December 31
 2019 was $1.83. The
aggregate grant date fair value of the 79
000 options granted during the year ended December 31
 2019 was $142
189.

For
the twelve months ended December 31
 2019
 net compensation expense related to stock options was $759
385. At December 31
 2019
the total compensation expense related to stock options not yet recognized is approximately $582
209
 which is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.80 years.

Board
Committees

In
September 2016
 our Board of Directors established the following standing committees: an audit committee
 a compensation committee
and a nominating and corporate governance committee. The Board of Directors determined that establishing standing audit
 compensation
and nominating and corporate governance committees is an important element of sound corporate governance.

Audit
Committee

Our
audit committee oversees the engagement of our independent public accountants
 reviews our audited financial statements
 meets
with our independent public accountants to review internal controls and reviews our financial plans. Our audit committee currently
consists of Geoffrey Gwin
 who is the chair of the committee
 Stephanie Kilkenny and Paul Shoen. Each of Messrs. Gwin
 Shoen and
Kilkenny has been determined by our Board of Directors to be independent in accordance with Nasdaq and SEC standards. Our
Board of Directors has also designated Mr. Gwin as an &ldquo;audit committee financial expert&rdquo; as the term is defined under
SEC regulations and has determined that Mr. Gwin possesses the requisite &ldquo;financial sophistication&rdquo; under applicable
Nasdaq rules. The audit committee operates under a written charter which is available on our website at https://www.eastsidedistilling.com/investors
Both our independent registered accounting firm and internal financial personnel will regularly meet with our audit committee
and have unrestricted access to the audit committee. Each member of the audit committee is able to read and understand fundamental
financial statements
 including our consolidated balance sheets
 consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements
of cash flows. Further
 no member of the audit committee has participated in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements
or those of any of our current subsidiaries
 at any time during the past three years.

Compensation
Committee

Our
compensation committee reviews and recommends policies
 practices and procedures relating to compensation for our directors
 officers
and other employees and advising and consulting with our officers regarding managerial personnel and development. Our compensation
committee currently consists of Stephanie Kilkenny
 who is the chair of the committee
 Geoffrey Gwin and Paul Shoen
 each of whom
has been determined by our Board of Directors to be independent in accordance with Nasdaq standards. Each member of our compensation
committee is also a non-employee director
 as defined pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act
 and an outside
director
 as defined pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended. The compensation committee operates
under a written charter which is available on the Company&rsquo;s website at https://www.eastsidedistilling.com/investors

Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee

Our
nominating and corporate governance committee (&ldquo;Nominating Committee&rdquo;) evaluates the composition
 size and
governance of our Board of Directors and its committees
 evaluating and recommending candidates for election to our Board of Directors
establishing a policy for considering stockholder nominees and reviewing our corporate governance principles and providing recommendations
to the Board of Directors. Our nominating committee currently consists of Paul Shoen
 who is the chair of the committee
 Geoffrey
Gwin and Stephanie Kilkenny
 each of whom has been determined by our Board of Directors to be independent in accordance with Nasdaq
standards. The Nominating Committee operates under a written charter which is available on the Company&rsquo;s website at 


    
    


Director
Nomination Process

The
Nominating Committee identifies director nominees by first considering those current members of the Board of Directors
who are willing to continue in service. Current members of the Board of Directors with skills and experience that are relevant
to our business and who are willing to continue in service are considered for re-nomination
 balancing the value of the skills
and experiences of the current members and the value of continuity of service by existing members of the Board of Directors
with that of obtaining a new perspective or skills and experiences. If any member of the Board of Directors does not wish
to continue in service
 if the nominating committee or the Board of Directors decides not to re-nominate a member for reelection
if the nominating committee or the Board of Directors decided to fill a director position that is currently vacant or if the nominating
committee or the Board of Directors decides to recommend that the size of the Board of Directors be increased
 the nominating
committee identifies the desired skills needed by the board and will evaluate the experience of a new nominee in light
of the criteria described above. Current members of the Board of Directors and management are polled for suggestions as to individuals
meeting the Board of Directors&rsquo; criteria. Research may also be performed to identify qualified individuals and
 if appropriate
the nominating committee may engage a search firm. Nominees for director are selected by a majority of the members of the Board
of Directors
 with any current directors who may be nominees themselves abstaining from any vote relating to their own nomination.
All of our directors participated in the consideration of the director nominees for election at the Annual Meeting. Although the
nominating committee and the Board of Directors do not have a formal diversity policy
 the Board of Directors instructed the nominating
committee to consider such factors as it deems appropriate to develop a Board and committees that are diverse in nature and comprised
of experienced and seasoned advisors. Factors considered by the nominating committee include judgment
 knowledge
 skill
 diversity
(including factors such as race
 gender and experience)
 integrity
 experience with businesses and other organizations of comparable
size
 including experience in the spirits industry
 business
 finance
 administration or public service
 the relevance of a candidate&rsquo;s
experience to our needs and experience of other board members
 familiarity with national and international business matters
 experience
with accounting rules and practices
 the desire to balance the considerable benefit of continuity with the periodic injection
of the fresh perspective provided by new members
 and the extent to which a candidate would be a desirable addition to the Board
of Directors and any committees of the Board of Directors.

In
addition
 directors are expected to be able to exercise their best business judgment when acting on behalf of us and all
stockholders
 act ethically at all times and adhere to the applicable provisions of our code of business conduct and ethics. Other
than consideration of the foregoing and applicable SEC and Nasdaq requirements
 unless determined otherwise by the Nominating
Committee
 there are no stated minimum criteria
 qualities or skills for director nominees. However
 the Nominating Committee
may also consider such other factors as it may deem are in the best interests of us and all stockholders. In addition
at least one member of the Board of Directors serving on the audit committee should meet the criteria for an &ldquo;audit committee
financial expert&rdquo; having the requisite &ldquo;financial sophistication&rdquo; under applicable Nasdaq and SEC rules
 and
a majority of the members of the Board of Directors should meet the definition of &ldquo;independent director&rdquo; under applicable
Nasdaq rules.

The
Nominating Committee and the Board of Directors may consider suggestions for persons to be nominated for director that are submitted
by stockholders. The Nominating Committee will evaluate stockholder suggestions for director nominees in the same manner as it
evaluates suggestions for director nominees made by management
 then-current directors or other appropriate sources. Stockholders
suggesting persons as director nominees should send information about a proposed nominee to our Secretary at our principal executive
offices as referenced above at least 90 days before the anniversary of the prior year&rsquo;s annual stockholder meeting. This
information should be in writing and should include a signed statement by the proposed nominee that he or she is willing to serve
as a director of Eastside Distilling
 Inc.
 a description of the proposed nominee&rsquo;s relationship to the stockholder and
any information that the stockholder feels will fully inform the Board of Directors about the proposed nominee and his or her
qualifications. The Board of Directors may request further information from the proposed nominee and the stockholder making the
recommendation. In addition
 a stockholder may nominate one or more persons for election as a director at our annual meeting of
stockholders.

General
Stockholder Communications

Stockholders
can send communications to the Board of Directors by sending a certified or registered letter to the Chairman of the Board
 care
of the Secretary
 at our main business address set forth above. Communications that are threatening
 illegal
 or similarly inappropriate
and advertisements
 solicitations for periodical or other subscriptions
 and other similar communications will generally not be
forwarded to the Chairman.


Code

have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that applies to all of our employees
 officers and directors. We will provide
to any person without charge
 upon request
 a copy of our code of business conduct and ethics. Requests may be directed to our

Item
12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS

The
following table sets forth information as of March 30
 2020 as to each person or group who is known to us to be the beneficial
owner of more than 5% of our outstanding voting securities and as to the security and percentage ownership of each of our executive
officers and directors and of all of our officers and directors as a group. As of March 30
 2020
 we had 9
672
028
shares of common stock outstanding.

Beneficial
ownership is determined under the rules of the SEC and generally includes voting or investment power over securities. Except in
cases where community property laws apply or as indicated in the footnotes to this table
 we believe that each stockholder identified
in the table possesses sole voting and investment power over all shares of common stock shown as beneficially owned by the stockholder.

Shares
of common stock subject to options or warrants that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of the date of March
30
 2020 are considered outstanding and beneficially owned by the person holding the options for the purpose of computing
the percentage ownership of that person but are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership
of any other person.

 2016
 the Company adopted the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the &ldquo;2016 Plan&rdquo;).

139 shares
 equal to 8% of the number of outstanding shares of the Company&rsquo;s
    capital stock
 calculated on an as-converted basis
 on December 31 of the preceding calendar year. On October 18
 2017
 the
    Board of Directors approved amendments to the 2016 Plan to (i) increase the number of shares of the common stock that may
    be issued under the 2016 Plan (the &ldquo;Aggregate Limit&rdquo;) by an additional 192

 for a total
    of 500
000 shares of common stock
 (ii) increase the number of shares of common stock that may be granted to any participant
    pursuant to options to purchase common stock and stock appreciation rights under the 2016 Plan in any one year period (the

333 shares to 200
000 shares
 (iii) increase the number of shares of common
    stock that may be granted to any participant pursuant to other awards (the &ldquo;Individual Award Limit&rdquo;) under the

000 shares and (iv) increase the number of shares of common stock
    that may be paid to any one participant under the 2016 Plan for a performance period pursuant to performance compensation

 2019
 there were 825
659 options and 527

Grover
Wickersham

On
December 29
 2017
 the Grover T. Wickersham Employees&rsquo; Profit Sharing Plan (&ldquo;PSP&rdquo;)
 an entity affiliated with
our former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman
 Grover Wickersham
 purchased from us a promissory note bearing interest at the
rate of 8% per annum (a &ldquo;Promissory Note&rdquo;) for aggregate consideration of $464
750. Interest is paid monthly. The
Promissory Note is due on June 30
 2019 or in the event the Company completes a private or public offering of its equity or debt
securities in which the gross amount raised in such financing is at least $2.0 million (a &ldquo;Future Financing&rdquo;)
 all
amount due under this Promissory Note shall become due and payable within five (5) business days of the final closing of such
Future Financing. In lieu of receiving the cash repayment of amounts due under this Promissory Note in connection with a Future
Financing
 at the option of PSP
 the principal amount due and payable may be used to purchase the securities offered in the Future
Financing. PSP used a balance of $379
750 to purchase the Company&rsquo;s new private offering of notes with warrants. The remaining
principal balance of $85
000 was paid in April 2018. The new promissory notes bear interest at 8% per annum
 payable monthly on
the last day of the month. The entire amount of principal and any accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable on May 1
 2021.
In conjunction with this new offering
 PSP was issued 37
975 warrants
 exercisable at $5.40 per share. On August 9

 PSP
exercised the 37
975 warrants at $5.40 per share in exchange for a reduction in outstanding note principal due. $174
685 remained
outstanding on the note.

On

 2019 or in the event the Company completes a private
or public offering of its equity or debt securities in which the gross amount raised in such financing is at least $2.0 million
(a &ldquo;Future Financing&rdquo;)
 all amount due under the Promissory Note shall become due and payable within five (5) business
days of the final closing of such Future Financing. In lieu of receiving the cash repayment of amounts due under the Promissory
Note in connection with a Future Financing
 at the option of Wickersham Trust

Stephanie
Kilkenny

Stephanie
Kilkenny was appointed to the Board in accordance with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement
 dated September 12
 2019 (the
&ldquo;Asset Purchase Agreement&rdquo;)
 between the Company and Intersect Beverage
 LLC
 a California limited liability company
(&ldquo;Intersect&rdquo;)
 pursuant to which the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Intersect (the &ldquo;Purchased
Assets&rdquo;)
 an importer and distributor of tequila and related products (the &ldquo;Transaction&rdquo;) under the brand name
&ldquo;Azu&ntilde;ia&rdquo;. The Transaction closed on September 12
 2019. In connection with the Transaction
 TQLA is entitled
to up to 93.88% of the aggregate consideration payable under the Asset Purchase Agreement. The aggregate consideration payable
under the Asset Purchase Agreement includes that number of shares of common stock of the Company
 cash payments and/or promissory
notes comprising (i) 1
200
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock (the &ldquo;Fixed Number of Shares&rdquo;) and
 (ii)
to the extent certain revenue targets are achieved
 the Initial Earnout Consideration (as defined below) and the Subsequent Earnout
Consideration (as defined below) The Fixed Number of Shares will be issued 540 days following the closing date of the Transaction
as follows: 850
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock will be issued at a stipulated value of $6.00 per share
 equivalent
to $5
100
000
 and the remaining 350
000 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock will be issued at a stipulated value equal
to the 20-day volume-weighted average closing price of Company common stock on September 12
 2020. In addition
 upon the acquired
business (which is comprised of Intersect&rsquo;s business of importing and distributing tequila and related products (the &ldquo;Business&rdquo;))
achieving gross revenues of $3.24 million or more during the first eighteen months following closing date of the Agreement
 the
Company will issue as further consideration (the &ldquo;Initial Earnout Consideration&rdquo;) additional shares of Company common
stock at a price per share equal to the 20-day volume-weighted average closing price of the Company&rsquo;s common stock on the
eighteen-month anniversary of the closing date of the Transaction. The number of additional shares of the Company&rsquo;s common
stock to be issued will be based upon a multiple of gross revenue of the Business
 ranging from 3.30 to 3.50
 and less the aggregate
stipulated dollar value of the Fixed Number of Shares previously paid.


    
    


If
the gross revenue of the acquired Business for the period commencing on the first day of the thirteenth month following the closing
date of the Transaction and ending on the last day of the twenty-fourth month following the closing date of the Transaction (the
&ldquo;Subsequent Earnout Period&rdquo;) equals or exceeds $9.45 million
 the Company will pay to the members of Intersect
 including
up to 93.88% to TQLA
 $1
500
000
 either in cash or a number of shares equal to (x) $1.5 million divided by (y) the 20-day volume-weighted
average closing price of the Company&rsquo;s common stock on the last day of the Subsequent Earnout Period
 rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock (the &ldquo;Subsequent Earnout Consideration&rdquo;).

Notwithstanding
anything set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement
 the Company will not be required to issue shares of common stock if
 in order
for the Company to issue sufficient shares to pay any portion of the aggregate consideration under the Agreement
 the Company
would be required to hold a vote of the Company&rsquo;s stockholders pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rules (i.e. the number of shares
of common stock of the Company issuable under the Agreement would exceed 19.9% of the Company&rsquo;s outstanding common stock).
In the event that the Company would be required to hold a vote of the Company&rsquo;s stockholders pursuant to Nasdaq Listing
Rules
 the Company may
 at its election
 issue only that number of shares of common stock which does not require such vote
 and
instead pay any remaining portion of the aggregate consideration in the form of cash or as a promissory note with a three-year
maturity that bears interest at a rate of 6% per annum.

Any
shares issued by the Company under the Asset Purchase Agreement will be issued
 at the Company&rsquo;s election
 either (i) as
registered shares under the Securities Act of 1933
 as amended (the &ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;) or (ii) as unregistered shares
in an issuance exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder.
If the Company issues unregistered shares
 the Company will file a re-sale registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities
and Exchange Commission for a secondary offering covering the resale of the unregistered shares. Such registration statement will
be filed no later than 30 days following the date of payment of the Initial Earnout Consideration and will be amended within 30
days following the issuance of any Subsequent Earnout Consideration.

In
addition
 TQLA is obligated to reimburse the Company for approximately $430
000 in certain expenses associated with the transaction.

On
September 16
 2019
 the Company entered into a Subscription Agreement with Mrs. Kilkenny&rsquo;s spouse
 Patrick J. Kilkenny as
Trustee For Patrick J. Kilkenny Revocable Trust (the &ldquo;Kilkenny Trust&rdquo;) in reliance on the exemption from registration
afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506(b) promulgated thereunder
 pursuant to which the Company agreed
to issue and sell to the Kilkenny Trust an aggregate of 55
555 units (the &ldquo;Units&rdquo;) at a per unit price of $4.50. Each
Unit consists of one share of the Company&rsquo;s common stock and a three-year warrant to acquire 0.5 shares of common stock
at an exercise price of $5.50 per share.

Effective
November 29
 2019
 the Company issued to TQLA
 a Secured Line of Credit Promissory Note (the &ldquo;Note&rdquo;) for a revolving
line of credit in the aggregate principal amount of $2
000
000. The Note matures on April 15
 2020 and may be prepaid in whole
or in part at any time without penalty or premium. Repayment of the Note is subject to acceleration in the event of an event of
default. The Company may use the proceeds to purchase tequila for its Azu&ntilde;ia product line and for general corporate purposes
as approved by TQLA. As of December 31
 2019
 the Company borrowed $946
640 on the Note. The Note was repaid in full on January
16
 2020.

We
believe that the foregoing transactions were in our best interests. Consistent with Section 78.140 of the Nevada Revised Statutes
it is our current policy that all transactions between us and our officers
 directors and their affiliates will be entered into
only if such transactions are approved by a majority of the disinterested directors
 are approved by vote of the stockholders
or are fair to us as a corporation as of the time it is authorized
 approved or ratified by the board. We will conduct an appropriate
review of all related party transactions on an ongoing basis
 and
 where appropriate
 we will utilize our audit committee for
the review of potential conflicts of interest.


    
    


Director
Independence

Generally
under the listing requirements and rules of Nasdaq
 independent directors must comprise a majority of a listed company&rsquo;s
board of directors. Our Board of Directors has undertaken a review of its composition
 the composition of its committees and the
independence of each director. Our Board of Directors has determined that Paul Shoen
 Geoff Gwin and Stephanie Kilkenny are independent
within the meaning of Nasdaq listing standards. Accordingly
 a majority of our directors is independent
 as required under applicable
Nasdaq rules. In making this determination
 our Board of Directors considered the current and prior relationships that each non-employee
director has with our company and all other facts and circumstances our board of directors deemed relevant in determining their
independence
 including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each non-employee director. In making this determination
the Board of Directors considered all transactions set forth under &ldquo;Certain Relationships and Related Transactions&rdquo;
above.

 by M&amp;K were $0.

Pre-Approval
Policies and Procedures

We
have implemented pre-approval policies and procedures related to the provision of audit and non-audit services. Under these procedures
our audit committee pre-approves all services to be provided by M&amp;K LLP and the estimated fees related to these services.

All
audit
 audit related
 and tax services were pre-approved by the audit committee
 which concluded that the provision of such services
by M&amp;K LLP was compatible with the maintenance of that firm&rsquo;s independence in the conduct of its auditing functions.
Our pre-approval policies and procedures provide for the audit committee&rsquo;s pre-approval of specifically described audit
audit-related
 and tax services on an annual basis
 but individual engagements anticipated to exceed pre-established thresholds
must be separately approved. The policies and procedures also require specific approval by the audit committee if total fees for
audit-related and tax services would exceed total fees for audit services in any fiscal year. The policies and procedures authorize
the audit committee to delegate to one or more of its members pre-approval authority with respect to permitted services.

DESCRIPTION
OF THE REGISTRANT&rsquo;S SECURITIES
REGISTERED
PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE
SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

The
following description of the registered securities of Eastside Distilling
 Inc. (&lsquo;we&rdquo;
 &ldquo;us&rdquo;
 &ldquo;our&rdquo;
or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) is a summary and does not purport to be complete. It is subject to and qualified in its entirety
by reference to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and the amendments thereto (collectively
 the &ldquo;Articles
of Incorporation&rdquo;) and our Amended and Restated Bylaws (collectively
 the &ldquo;Bylaws&rdquo;)
 each of which is incorporated
by reference as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.5 is a part. We encourage you to read our
Articles of Incorporation
 our Bylaws and the applicable provisions of The Nevada Revised Statutes (the &ldquo;NRS&rdquo;)
 for
additional information.

Authorized
Shares

Our
authorized capital stock consists of 15
000
000 shares of common stock
 par value $0.0001 per share and 100
000
000 shares of
preferred stock
 par value of $0.0001 per share. As of March 30
 2020
 we have 9
762
728 shares of common stock and no shares
of preferred stock outstanding. Our common stock is our only class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

Common
Stock

Holders
of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters subject to stockholder vote. Holders of our common stock
do not have cumulative voting rights.

If
the Board of Directors were to declare a dividend out of funds legally available therefor
 all of the outstanding shares of common
stock would be entitled to receive such dividend ratably.

If
our business was liquidated or dissolved
 holders of shares of common stock would be entitled to share ratably in assets remaining
after satisfaction of our liabilities
 subject to any preference rights of holders of indebtedness or outstanding preferred stock.

The
holders of shares of common stock have no preemptive
 conversion
 redemption or sinking fund rights.

Anti-takeover
Effects of Certain Provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws

Authorized
but Unissued Securities

The
existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock may enable our Board of Directors to render more difficult or to discourage
an attempt to obtain control of the Company by means of a merger
 tender offer or otherwise.

In
addition
 the Board of Directors is authorized from time to time to establish one or more series of preferred stock and to determine
and prescribe the voting powers
 distinguishing designations
 preferences
 limitations
 restrictions and relative rights of the
preferred stock before issuance of any shares of that class and of any series of preferred stock before issuance of shares of
that series.

The
issuance of preferred stock may delay
 deter or prevent a change in control. We believe that our Board of Directors&rsquo; ability
to issue preferred stock on such a wide variety of terms will enable the preferred stock to be used for important corporate purposes
such as financing acquisitions or raising additional capital. However
 were it inclined to do so
 our Board of Directors could
issue all or part of the preferred stock with
 among other things
 substantial voting power or advantageous conversion rights.
This preferred stock could be issued to persons deemed by our Board of Directors likely to support our current management in a
context for control of us
 either as a precautionary measure or in response to a specific takeover threat.

No
Cumulative Voting

Our
Articles of Incorporation do not grant holders of the common stock the right to vote cumulatively. The absence of cumulative voting
could have the effect of preventing stock holding a minority of the Company&rsquo;s shares from obtaining representation on the
Board of Directors.


    
    


Notice
Provisions Relating to Stockholder Proposals and Nominees

Our
Bylaws contain provisions requiring stockholders to give advance written notice to the Company of a proposal or director nomination
in order to have that proposal or nominee considered at the annual meeting of stockholders. A stockholder&rsquo;s notice must
be delivered no later than ninety (90) days nor earlier than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the first anniversary of the
preceding year&rsquo;s annual meeting (provided
 however
 that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty
(30) days before or more than sixty (60) days after such anniversary date
 notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not
earlier than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to such annual meeting and not later than ninety (90) days prior to such annual
meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the
Company).

Calling
a Stockholder Meeting

Special
meetings of stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the entire Board of Directors
 any two directors
or the President of the Company. Special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons.

Nevada
Anti-Takeover Laws

We
have not opted out of Nevada&rsquo;s Business Combinations Statute and Control Share Acquisition Statute in our Articles of Incorporation
and as a result
 both statutes may have the effect of delaying or making it more difficult to effect a change in control of the
Company
 to the extent applicable to us.

Business
Combinations Act

Nevada&rsquo;s
&ldquo;combinations with interested stockholders&rdquo; statutes (NRS 78.411 through 78.444
 inclusive) prohibit specified types
of business &ldquo;combinations&rdquo; between certain Nevada corporations and any person deemed to be an &ldquo;interested stockholder&rdquo;
for two years after such person first becomes an &ldquo;interested stockholder&rdquo; unless the corporation&rsquo;s board of
directors approves the combination (or the transaction by which such person becomes an &ldquo;interested stockholder&rdquo;) in
advance
 or unless the combination is approved by the board of directors and sixty percent of the corporation&rsquo;s voting power
not beneficially owned by the interested stockholder
 its affiliates and associates. Further
 in the absence of prior approval
certain restrictions may apply even after such two-year period. However
 these statutes do not apply to any combination of a corporation
and an interested stockholder after the expiration of four years after the person first became an interested stockholder.

For
purposes of these statutes
 an &ldquo;interested stockholder&rdquo; is any person who is (A) the beneficial owner
 directly or
indirectly
 of ten percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation
 or (B) an affiliate
or associate of the corporation and at any time within the two previous years was the beneficial owner
 directly or indirectly
of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of the corporation. The definition of the term &ldquo;combination&rdquo;
is sufficiently broad to cover most significant transactions between a corporation and an &ldquo;interested stockholder.&rdquo;

The
provisions of the NRS relating to combinations with interested stockholders could have the effect of delaying
 deferring or preventing
a change in our control or the removal of our existing management.

Control
Share Acquisitions

The
&ldquo;control share&rdquo; provisions of Sections 78.378 to 78.3793
 inclusive
 of the NRS
 which apply only to Nevada corporations
with at least 200 stockholders of record
 including at least 100 stockholders of record who are Nevada residents
 and which conduct
business directly or indirectly in Nevada
 prohibit an acquirer
 under certain circumstances
 from voting its shares of a target
corporation&rsquo;s stock after crossing certain ownership threshold percentages
 unless the acquirer obtains approval of the
target corporation&rsquo;s disinterested stockholders. The statute specifies three thresholds: (a) one-fifth or more but less
than one-third
 (b) one-third but less than a majority
 and (c) a majority or more
 of the outstanding voting power. Once an acquirer
crosses one of the above thresholds
 those shares in an offer or acquisition and acquired within 90 days thereof become &ldquo;control
shares&rdquo; and such control shares are deprived of the right to vote until disinterested stockholders restore the right. These
provisions also provide that if control shares are accorded full voting rights and the acquiring person has acquired a majority
or more of all voting power
 all other stockholders who do not vote in favor of authorizing voting rights to the control shares
are entitled to demand payment for the fair value of their shares in accordance with statutory procedures established for dissenters&rsquo;
rights.

common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the trading symbol &ldquo;EAST&rdquo;.

Warrant
 of this Warrant
 subject to the provisions
and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Warrant.

ARTICLE
1



1.1
 Holder may at any time and from time to time exercise this Warrant
 in whole or in part
 by delivering
to the Company the original of this Warrant together with a duly executed Notice of Exercise in substantially the form attached
 and

1.2
 a check
 wire transfer of same-day funds (to an account designated by the Company)
 or other form of payment acceptable
to the Company for the aggregate Warrant Price for the Shares being purchased.

1.2
 On any exercise of this Warrant
 in lieu of payment of the aggregate Warrant Price in the manner as
 above
 but otherwise in accordance with the requirements of 
 Holder may elect
to receive Shares equal to the value of this Warrant

Exercise
 the Company shall issue to Holder such number of fully paid and non-assessable Shares as are
computed using the following formula:




    
X
    = 
    



    
    






    
X
    =
the
    number of Shares to be issued to Holder;

    
    
    

    
Y
    =
the
    number of Shares with respect to which this Warrant is being exercised (inclusive of the Shares surrendered to the Company
    in payment of the aggregate Warrant Price);

    
    
    

    
A
    =
the
    Fair Market Value (as determined pursuant to 

    
    
    

    
B
    =
the
    Warrant Price.


1.3
&rdquo;) of a Share as of a particular date
shall mean the average of the closing prices of such security&rsquo;s sales on a national securities exchange
 the Nasdaq Select
Global Market
 the Nasdaq Global Market
 the Nasdaq Capital Market
 the OTC Bulletin Board or another nationally recognized trading
system
 in each such case averaged over a period of five (5) days consisting of the day prior to the day as of which Fair Market
Value is being determined and the five (5) consecutive business days prior to such day. If at any time such security is not listed
on a national securities exchange
 the Nasdaq Select Global Market
 the Nasdaq Global Market
 the Nasdaq Capital Market
 the OTC
Bulletin Board or another nationally recognized trading system as of the applicable exercise date
 the &ldquo;Fair Market Value&rdquo;
shall be the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors; 
 that if
Holder disagrees with the Board of Directors&rsquo; determination of such fair market value
 the Company and Holder shall negotiate
in good faith for 15 days to determine such Fair Market Value. If at the end of such 15-day period
 the parties are unable to
reach agreement with respect to such Fair Market Value
 then they shall select a mutually acceptable independent third party appraiser
&rdquo;). The Independent Appraiser&rsquo;s appraisal shall be the
Fair Market Value and shall be binding on the Company and Holder. The cost of the Independent Appraiser
 if any
 shall be shared
equally among the Company and Holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 in the event of an automatic exercise immediately prior to
a Cash Acquisition (as defined below) pursuant to 
 the Fair Market Value of a Share shall mean the value
of the cash consideration payable per Share pursuant to the terms of such Cash Acquisition
 which amount shall assume the full
payout of any contingent right to future payments of cash.

1.4
 Within a reasonable time after Holder exercises this Warrant in the manner set
 above
 the Company shall deliver to Holder a certificate or book entry notations representing
the Shares issued to Holder upon such exercise and
 if this Warrant has not been fully exercised and has not expired
 a new warrant
of like tenor representing the Shares not so acquired.

1.5
 On receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss
 theft
 destruction
or mutilation of this Warrant and
 in the case of loss
 theft or destruction
 on delivery of an indemnity agreement reasonably
satisfactory in form and amount to the Company or
 in the case of mutilation
 on surrender and cancellation of this Warrant
 the
Company shall
 at its expense and within a reasonable time
 execute and deliver
 in lieu of this Warrant
 a new warrant of like
tenor.

1.6


(a)
. For the purpose of this Warrant
&rdquo; means any transaction or series of related
transactions involving: (i) the sale
 lease
 exclusive license
 or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Company; (ii) any merger or consolidation of the Company into or with another person or entity (other than a merger or
consolidation effected exclusively to change the Company&rsquo;s domicile)
 or any other corporate reorganization
 in which the
stockholders of the Company in their capacity as such immediately prior to such merger
 consolidation or reorganization
 own less
than a majority of the Company&rsquo;s (or the surviving or successor entity&rsquo;s) outstanding voting power immediately after
such merger
 consolidation or reorganization; or (iii) any sale or other transfer by the stockholders of the Company of shares
representing at least a majority of the Company&rsquo;s then-total outstanding combined voting power.


    
    


(b)
 In the event of an Acquisition in which the consideration to be received
by the Company&rsquo;s stockholders consists solely of cash and/or a contingent right to future payments of cash (such as earnout
payments and contingent value rights and excluding
 for the avoidance of doubt
 equity or other securities issued by the Company
&rdquo;)
 and the Fair Market Value of one Share as determined in accordance
 above would be greater than the Warrant Price in effect on such date immediately prior to such Cash Acquisition
 above as to all Shares
 then this Warrant shall automatically
 above as to all remaining Shares effective immediately prior to and contingent
upon the consummation of a Cash Acquisition. In connection with such Cashless Exercise
 Holder shall be deemed to have restated
 of this Warrant as of the date thereof and the Company shall
promptly notify Holder of the number of Shares (or such other securities) issued upon exercise. In the event of a Cash Acquisition
 above would be less than the Warrant
Price in effect immediately prior to such Cash Acquisition
 then this Warrant will expire immediately prior to the consummation
of such Cash Acquisition.

(c)
Upon the closing of any Acquisition other than a Cash Acquisition defined
above
 the acquiring
 surviving or successor entity shall assume the obligations of this Warrant
 and this Warrant shall thereafter
be exercisable for the same securities and/or other property as would have been paid for the Shares issuable upon exercise of
the unexercised portion of this Warrant as if such Shares were outstanding on and as of the closing of such Acquisition
 subject
to further adjustment from time to time in accordance with the provisions of this Warrant.

 then upon exercise of this Warrant
 for each
Share acquired
 Holder shall receive
 without additional cost to Holder
 the total number and kind of securities and property
which Holder would have received had Holder owned the Shares of record as of the date the dividend or distribution occurred. If
the Company subdivides the outstanding shares of the Class by reclassification or otherwise into a greater number of shares
 the
number of Shares purchasable hereunder shall be proportionately increased and the Warrant Price shall be proportionately decreased.
If the outstanding shares of the Class are combined or consolidated

 then
 unless this Warrant has expired
 the Company shall
at its expense
 at the time of delivery of such certificates
 deliver to the holder a new Warrant representing the number of shares
with respect to which this Warrant shall not then have been exercised.


    
    


Notwithstanding
anything in this Warrant to the contrary
 in no event shall the holder of this Warrant be entitled to exercise this Warrant for
a number of shares of Common Stock that would require the Company to hold a vote of the Company&rsquo;s stockholders pursuant
to Nasdaq Listing Rules (i.e. the number of shares Common Stock issuable under this Warrant will not exceed 19.9% of the Company&rsquo;s
outstanding shares of Common Stock).

2.

principal and any remaining accrued interest on the Note in full on or prior to the Maturity Date (as defined in the Note) (the
day following the Maturity Date
&rdquo;). This Warrant is exercisable at any time or from time

 New York
 New York time on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Effective

3.


(a)
 All Warrant Shares will
 upon issuance in accordance with the terms of this Warrant
 be
validly issued
 fully paid
 and nonassessable and free from all taxes
 liens
 and charges with respect to the issue thereof.

(b)
 During the Exercise Period
 the Company shall at all times have authorized
 and reserved
for the purpose of issuance upon exercise of this Warrant
 a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to provide for the exercise
of this Warrant.

(c)
 The Company will not
 by amendment of its charter or through any reorganization
 transfer
of assets
 consolidation
 merger
 dissolution
 issue or sale of securities
 or any other voluntary action
 avoid or seek to avoid
the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed by it hereunder
 but will at all times in good faith
assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Warrant.

(d)
 This Warrant will be binding upon any entity succeeding to the Company by merger
 consolidation
or acquisition of all or substantially all the Company&rsquo;s assets.

4.
. During the Exercise Period
 the Exercise Price and the number of Warrant Shares shall be subject
to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Paragraph 4. In the event that any adjustment of the Exercise Price as required
herein results in a fraction of a cent
 such Exercise Price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent.

(a)
 If the Company at any time subdivides (by any stock split
 stock dividend
recapitalization
 reorganization
 reclassification or otherwise) the shares of Common Stock acquirable hereunder into a greater
number of shares
 then
 after the date of record for effecting such subdivision
 the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior
to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. If the Company at any time combines (by reverse stock split
 recapitalization
reorganization
 reclassification or otherwise) the shares of Common Stock acquirable hereunder into a smaller number of shares
then
 after the date of record for effecting such combination
 the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such combination
will be proportionately increased.

(b)
Consolidation
 In case of any consolidation of the Company with
 or merger of the Company into any
other corporation
 or in case of any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company other than in
connection with a plan of complete liquidation of the Company
 then as a condition of such consolidation
 merger or sale or conveyance
adequate provision will be made whereby the holder of this Warrant will have the right to acquire and receive upon exercise of
this Warrant in lieu of the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore acquirable upon the exercise of this Warrant
 such
shares of stock
 securities or assets as may be issued or payable with respect to or in exchange for the number of shares of Common
Stock immediately theretofore acquirable and receivable upon exercise of this Warrant had such consolidation
 merger or sale or
conveyance not taken place. In any such case
 the Company will make appropriate provision to ensure that the provisions of this
Paragraph 4 hereof will thereafter be applicable as nearly as may be in relation to any shares of stock or securities thereafter
deliverable upon the exercise of this Warrant.


    
    


(c)
 In case the Company shall declare or make any distribution of its assets (including cash)
to all holders of Common Stock as a partial liquidating dividend
 by way of return of capital or otherwise
 then
 after the date
 to such distribution
 but prior to the date of distribution
 the
holder of this Warrant shall be entitled upon exercise of this Warrant for the purchase of any or all of the shares of Common
Stock subject hereto
 to receive the amount of such assets which would have been payable to the holder had such holder been the
holder of such shares of Common Stock on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to such distribution.

(d)
 Upon the occurrence of any event which requires any adjustment of the Exercise Price
 then
and in each such case
 the Company shall give notice thereof to the holder of this Warrant
 which notice shall state the Exercise
Price resulting from such adjustment and the increase or decrease in the number of Warrant Shares purchasable at such price upon
exercise
 setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based.

(e)
 No adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be made in an amount of less than
1% of the Exercise Price in effect at the time such adjustment is otherwise required to be made
 but any such lesser adjustment
shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time and together with the next subsequent adjustment which
 together with any
adjustments so carried forward
 shall amount to not less than 1% of such Exercise Price.

(f)
 No fractional shares of Common Stock are to be issued upon the exercise of this Warrant
 but
the Company shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of any fractional share which would otherwise be issuable in an amount equal
to the same fraction of the Market Price of a share of Common Stock on the date of such exercise.

(g)


(1)
the Company shall declare any dividend upon the Common Stock payable in shares of stock of any class or make any other distribution
(including dividends or distributions payable in cash out of retained earnings) to the holders of the Common Stock;

(2)
the Company shall offer for subscription pro rata to the holders of the Common Stock any additional shares of stock of any class
or other rights;

(3)
there shall be any capital reorganization of the Company
 or reclassification of the Common Stock
 or consolidation or merger
of the Company with or into
 or sale of all or substantially all its assets to
 another corporation or entity; or

(4)
there shall be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution
 liquidation or winding up of the Company;

then
in each such case
 the Company shall give to the holder of this Warrant (a) notice of the date on which the books of the Company
shall close or a record shall be taken for determining the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive any such dividend
 distribution
or subscription rights or for determining the holders of Common Stock entitled to vote in respect of any such reorganization
reclassification
 consolidation
 merger
 sale
 dissolution
 liquidation or winding-up and (b) in the case of any such reorganization
reclassification

rights as a shareholder of the Company. No provision of this Warrant

 and now desire to amend the Original Agreement as is set forth in this First Amendment.

NOW
THEREFORE
 in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants set forth in this First Amendment
 the adequacy and sufficiency
of which are hereby acknowledged
 the parties hereto
 each intending to legally be bound
 do hereby covenant and agree as follows:

I.
. All terms used in this First Amendment with an initial capital letter that are not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Original Agreement.

II.
. Section 20(c) of the Original Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and the following
Section 20(c) is hereby inserted in lieu thereof:

&ldquo;c.
&rsquo;)
Licensor shall (or cause Trust to
 as applicable) remit to Licensee:



    
    
Upon the consummation of such IP Sale
 fifty percent
(50%) of those out-of-pocket marketing expenses (and
 for avoidance of doubt
 not in respect of payments of Flat Fees) approved
by Licensor in each case in writing
 which were expended by Licensee solely in promoting the Distilled Spirits Products hereunder
&rsquo;)
except that
 any marketing expenses incurred by Licensee after September 15
 2019 shall not include sales salaries and benefits
and only include out-of-pocket marketing expenses related to Redneck Riviera Whiskey; and



    
    




    
    
&rsquo;)
Applicable
Percentage
 which is actually received by Licensor or Trust (without
duplication) as part such IP Sale
 subject to the terms and conditions hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 the Applicable Percentage
shall only apply to that amount actually received at closing or
 but subject to the below
 based on an installment sale by Licensor
 include any amounts respecting artist endorsement or non-compete payments
 costs and/or
expenses incurred in consummating the IP sale
 taxes and the like
 including any such amounts paid or owing to any unaffiliated
third party as part of
 or in connection with
 or paid to a third-party respecting indemnification claims made by the purchaser

 in the event the IP Sale was primarily sourced (e.g.
 if the purchaser

the Net Purchase Price shall not include any amounts respecting earn-outs after the initial closing
 pay-outs after the initial
closing

Payments
 in the event that the foregoing purchase and sale also contemplates the sale of any other intellectual
property owned and/or held by Licensor and/or Artist
 directly or indirectly (e.g.
 &lsquo;REDNECK RIVIERA&rsquo; in IC 25)
 then
only that part of the Net Purchase Price directly and solely applicable and allocable to the Authorized Property actively under
license hereunder (e.g.
 the Initial Products only if Licensee is manufacturing and causing the active distribution of same at
the time of such IP Sale) shall be considered in computing the Sales Bonus hereunder in accordance with 


Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 20(c)(ii) to the contrary
 no Deferred Payment amount will be excluded from the determination of Net
Purchase Price if the exclusion of same would result in Licensee receiving a Sales Bonus of less than [***]; provided
 however
in no event shall the total amount of Sale Bonus paid by Licensor or Trust as part of any IP Sale
 if Licensee participated in
any Deferred Payment as a result of this paragraph
 equal more than [***]. For example only
 if the consideration payable in the
IP Sale equaled $[***]
 Licensee would be entitled to [***] ([***] times [***]%)
 irrespective of whether any portion of the Deferred
Payment would have otherwise been excluded from Net Purchase Price under this Section 20(c)(ii) (e.g.
 because of such Deferred
Payments).

iii.
. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary
 in the event that an IP Sale is
consummated during the Six Month Termination Window
 Licensee shall not be entitled to any Sales Bonus or other amount whatsoever.&rdquo;

III.
. The Original Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the chart title phrase &ldquo;Bonus Amount Tier of
Net Purchase Price&rdquo; on Exhibit C thereof in its entirety and hereby replacing such phrase with the chart title phrase &ldquo;Amount
of Net Purchase Price&rdquo; in lieu thereof.

IV.
. Except as expressly amended herein

 2019
 we&#13;had $0.3 million of cash on hand with a positive working capital of $8.3 million. Our ability to meet our ongoing operating cash&#13;needs over the next 12 months depends on reducing our operating costs
 raising additional debt or equity capital and generating&#13;positive operating cash flow
 primarily through increased sales
 improved profit growth and controlling expenses. We intend to&#13;implement actions to improve profitability
 by managing expenses while continuing to increase sales. Additionally
 we are seeking&#13;to leverage our large inventory balances and our accounts receivable balance to help satisfy its working capital needs over the&#13;next 12 months. See Notes 10
 11 and 18 to our financial statements for a description of our debt and the debt refinancing initiatives&#13;completed in the first quarter of 2020. If we are unable to obtain additional financing
 or additional financing is not available&#13;on acceptable terms
 we may seek to sell assets
 reduce operating expenses or reduce or eliminate marketing initiatives

 establishes a framework&#13;for measuring fair value
 and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. GAAP permits an entity to choose to measure&#13;many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and contains financial statement presentation and disclosure requirements&#13;for assets and liabilities for which the fair value option is elected. At December 31

 2019 or 2018. However
 GAAP requires the disclosure of fair value information about&#13;financial instruments that are not measured at fair value. Financial instruments consist principally of trade receivables
 accounts&#13;payable
 accrued liabilities
 note payable
 and convertible note payable. The estimated fair value of trade receivables
 accounts&#13;payable
 and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to the short period of time to their maturities. At December&#13;31

&#13;which approximates cost under the first-in
 first-out (FIFO) method. A portion of inventory is held by certain independent distributors&#13;on consignment until it is sold to a third party. The Company regularly monitors inventory quantities on hand and records write-downs&#13;for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on the Company&amp;#8217;s estimated forecast of product demand and production&#13;requirements. Such write-downs establish a new cost basis of accounting for the related inventory. The Company recorded write-downs&#13;of inventory of $0.3 million and $Nil for the years ended December 31

 at amortized cost. Management reviews long-lived assets for probable impairment&#13;whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If there is an indication&#13;of impairment
 management would prepare an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to&#13;result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these estimated cash flows were less than the carrying amount
&#13;an impairment loss would be recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The Company performed a qualitative&#13;assessment of goodwill at December 31

Individual states also impose excise taxes on alcoholic beverages in varying amounts.

 which is generally the same as the vesting&#13;period. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model
 which estimates the fair value of&#13;each award on the date of grant based on a variety of assumptions including expected stock price volatility

 and dividend rates
 if applicable. Stock-based awards issued to nonemployees are recorded&#13;at fair value on the measurement date and are subject to periodic market adjustments at the end of each reporting period and as&#13;the underlying stock-based awards vest. Stock-based compensation was $0.7 million and $0.7 million in fiscal years 2019 and 2018

 the Company has the option to sell certain customer account receivables&#13;in advance of payment for 75% (spirits program) or 85% (co-packing program) of the amount due. When the customer remits payment
&#13;the Company receives the remaining balance. For the spirits program
 interest is charged on the advanced 75% payment at a rate&#13;of 2.4% for the first 30 days plus 1.44% for each additional ten-day period. For the co-packing program
 interest is charged against&#13;the greater of $500
000 or the total funds advanced at a rate of 5% plus the prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal. Under&#13;the terms of both agreements
 the factoring provider has full recourse against the Company should the customer fail to pay the&#13;invoice. In accordance with ASC 860
 we have concluded that these agreements have met all three conditions identified in ASC 860-10-40-5&#13;(a) &amp;#8211; (c) and have accounted for this activity as a sale. Given the quality of the factored accounts
 the Company has not&#13;recognized a recourse obligation. In certain limited instances
 the Company may provide collection services on the factored accounts&#13;but does not receive any fees for acting as the collection agent
 and as such
 the Company has not recognized a service obligation&#13;asset or liability. The Company factored $2.2 million of invoices and incurred $0.1 million in fees associated with the factoring&#13;programs during the year ended December 31

 management made a strategic shift to focus the Company&amp;#8217;s sale and marketing efforts&#13;on the nationally branded product platform
 resulting in the decision to close all four of its retail stores in the Portland

 it does not meet the (2) Held&#13;for sale criteria until the retail stores are closed / abandoned
 which is planned to occur by March 31

 and interim periods within those fiscal years and amend the existing accounting standards for the statement&#13;of cash flows. The amendments provide guidance on the following nine cash flow issues: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs;&#13;settlement of zero-coupon or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective&#13;interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement&#13;of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies; distributions received from equity&#13;method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; separately identifiable cash flows and application of the&#13;predominance principle; and restricted cash. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 and ASU 2016-18 on January 1

 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09
 which&#13;superseded virtually all existing revenue guidance. Under this update
 an entity is required to recognize revenue upon transfer&#13;of promised goods or services to customers
 in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those&#13;goods or services. As such
 an entity will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the current guidance. ASU&#13;2014-09 is to be applied retrospectively either to each prior reporting period presented in the financial statements
 or only to&#13;the most current reporting period presented in the financial statements with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings.&#13;The Company elected to apply ASU 2014-09 with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings. In August 2015
 the FASB issued&#13;ASU No. 2015-14
 &lt;i&gt;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date &lt;/i&gt;(&amp;#8220;ASU 2015-14&amp;#8221;).&#13;ASU 2015-14 deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year
 making it effective for the year beginning December 31
 2017
&#13;with early adoption permitted as of January 1
 2017. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 as of January 1

 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
&#13;&lt;i&gt;Leases (Topic 842)&lt;/i&gt; (&amp;#8220;ASU 2016-02&amp;#8221;)&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; Under the new guidance

 which is a lessee&amp;#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
 measured on a discounted basis; and&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#13;&lt;tr&gt;&#13;    &lt;td style=text-align: justify&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&#13;    &lt;td style=vertical-align: top; text-align: justify&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&#13;    &lt;td style=text-align: justify&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#13;&lt;tr&gt;&#13;    &lt;td style=text-align: justify&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&#13;    &lt;td style=vertical-align: top; text-align: justify&gt;&lt;font style=font-size: 10pt&gt;-&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#13;    &lt;td style=text-align: justify&gt;&lt;font style=font-size: 10pt&gt;A right-of-use asset
 which is an asset that represents the lessee&amp;#8217;s right to use
 or control the use of

 lessor accounting will&#13;be largely unchanged. Certain targeted improvements were made to align
 where necessary
 lessor accounting with the lessee accounting&#13;model and ASU No. 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The new lease guidance simplified the accounting for sale and&#13;leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Lessees will no longer be provided&#13;with a source of off-balance sheet financing. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years&#13;beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years (i.e.
 January 1
 2019
 for a calendar year&#13;entity). Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type
 direct financing
 and operating leases) must apply&#13;a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the beginning of the earliest comparative&#13;period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for&#13;leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition&#13;approach. In July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-11
 &lt;i&gt;Leases (Topic 842). &lt;/i&gt;This guidance provides an additional (and optional)&#13;transition method whereby the new lease standard is applied at the adoption date and recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings.&#13;In addition
 this ASU provides a practical expedient
 by class of underlying asset
 to not separate nonlease components from the&#13;associated lease and instead account for the lease as a single component if both the timing and pattern of transfer of the nonlease&#13;component(s) are the same
 and if the lease would be classified as an operating lease. These amendments have the same effective&#13;date as ASU 2016-02. On January 1
 2019
 the Company adopted the new accounting standard using the modified retrospective approach&#13;and elected to not adjust comparative periods. Upon adoption
 the Company recognized right-of-use assets of $0.9 million
 lease&#13;liabilities of $1.1 million

 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07
&#13;&lt;i&gt;Compensation &amp;#8211; Stock Compensation (Topic 718) &amp;#8211; Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting&lt;/i&gt; (&amp;#8220;ASU&#13;2018-07&amp;#8221;)
 which aligns the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to employees and nonemployees. Under ASU 2018-07
&#13;the existing employee guidance will apply to nonemployee share-based transactions (as long as the transaction is not effectively&#13;a form of financing)
 with the exception of specific guidance related to the attribution of compensation cost. The cost of nonemployee&#13;awards will continue to be recorded as if the grantor had paid cash for the goods or services. In addition
 the contractual term&#13;will be able to be used in lieu of an expected term in the option-pricing model for nonemployee awards. The new standard became&#13;effective on January 1
 2019 and should be applied to all new awards granted after the date of adoption. The Company adopted ASU&#13;2018-07 as of January 1

 the FASB issued ASU 2017-04
&#13;&lt;i&gt;Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) &amp;#8211; Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment&lt;/i&gt; (&amp;#8220;ASU 2017-04&amp;#8221;).&#13;ASU 2017-04 will simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Current&#13;guidance requires that companies compute the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2 by performing procedures to determine&#13;the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities following the procedure that would be required in&#13;determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. ASU 2017-04 will require companies&#13;to perform annual or interim goodwill impairment tests by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount&#13;and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&amp;#8217;s fair value.&#13;However
 the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 will&#13;be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 including interim periods within those fiscal years

 and alleged
 among other things
 that the Company&#13;and certain current and former officers and employees engaged in sex discrimination
 retaliation for reporting sexual discrimination
&#13;sexual harassment
 and aiding and abetting unlawful discrimination. As relief
 the complaint sought
 among other things
 monetary&#13;damages of up to $560

 without considering any dilutive&#13;items. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares&#13;outstanding and the potential number of any dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities&#13;consist of the incremental common stock issuable upon exercise of stock options and convertible notes. Potentially dilutive securities&#13;are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive. There were no dilutive common shares at December 31

 and vary by lease. These lease obligations expire at various dates through 2023. As the rate implicit&#13;in each lease is not readily determinable
 the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available at commencement&#13;to determine the present value of the lease payments. Based on the present value of the lease payments for the remaining lease&#13;term of the Company&amp;#8217;s existing leases
 the Company recognized right-of-use assets of $0.9 million
 lease liabilities of $1.1&#13;million
 and a net adjustment to retained earnings of $0.2 million upon adoption on January 1
 2019. Right-of-use assets and lease&#13;liabilities commencing after January 1
 2019 are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over&#13;the lease term. As of December 31
 2019
 the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were $0.7 million and $0.9 million
 respectively.&#13;Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (&amp;#8220;short-term leases&amp;#8221;) are not recorded on the balance sheet and are&#13;recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Aggregate lease expense for the year ended December 31
 2019 was $0.9&#13;million

 Ltd. In December 2014
 we changed our corporate&#13;name to Eastside Distilling
 Inc. to reflect our acquisition of Eastside Distilling
 LLC. We manufacture

 including bourbon
 American whiskey
 vodka
 gin

 tequila&amp;#160;and Ready-to-Drink (RTD).&amp;#160;We&#13;sell our products on a wholesale basis to distributors
 and until March 2020
 we operated four retail tasting rooms in Portland

 2-Year
 Extra-Aged

 international spirits marketplace occupied by large multi-national conglomerates
 we seek to utilize our size and our&#13;public company stature to our advantage and position Eastside Distilling as a leading tier 2 spirits provider by acquiring and&#13;developing brands
 growing them to a national presence and positioning them for sale to the tier 1 suppliers to the market. This&#13;strategy was demonstrated by the launch of our Redneck Riviera Brand (RRW) in conjunction with&amp;#160;our branding partners
&amp;#160;Sandstrom&#13;Partners in 2018. This demonstrated how our team can leverage its position to launch nascent or new brands and grow them more quickly&#13;than the tier 1 larger conglomerates because we are able to focus and dedicate more of our attention to developing&#13;innovative products. Our RRW brand went from idea
 to market roll-out in less than nine months and achieved national distribution&#13;in 49 states in 18 months.&amp;#160;In September 2019

&#13;we used our shares to acquire 90% of Big Bottom Distilling
 LLC (&amp;#8220;BBD&amp;#8221;)
 known for its award-winning
 super-premium&#13;gins and whiskeys
 and American Single Malt Whiskey. BBD&amp;#8217;s super-premium spirits give us a presence at the &amp;#8220;ultra-premium&#13;segment&amp;#8221; of the market. In December 2018
 we acquired the remaining 10% of BBD. In September 2019
 we also acquired the&#13;high-end
 luxury tequila brand
 Azu&amp;#241;ia
 to complement our portfolio and provide us with a larger established brand in the&#13;high-growth tequila category. In addition
 through MotherLode Craft Distillery (&amp;#8220;MotherLode&amp;#8221;)
 our wholly-owned subsidiary&#13;acquired in March 2017 and Craft Canning + Bottling
 LLC (formerly known as Craft Canning
 LLC) (&amp;#8220;Craft Canning&amp;#8221;)
&#13;which we acquired in January 2019
 we provide contract bottling
 canning
 and packaging services for existing and emerging beer
&#13;wine and spirits producers. We have used our&amp;#160;mobile&amp;#160;canning&amp;#160;operations&amp;#160;to profit from the rapid growth&#13;in the canned beverages industry (beer

 the Company has a cumulative&#13;net operating loss carryforward (NOL) of approximately $37.8 million
 to offset against future income for federal and state tax&#13;purposes. These federal and state NOLs can be carried forward for 20 and 15 years
 respectively. The federal NOLs begin to expire&#13;in 2034
 and the state NOLs begin to expire in 2029. The utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to&#13;substantial annual limitation due to ownership change provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended
 the Internal&#13;Revenue Code) and similar state provisions. In general
 if the Company experiences a greater than 50 percentage aggregate change&#13;in ownership of certain significant stockholders over a three-year period (a &amp;#8220;Section 382 ownership change&amp;#8221;)

 management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not&#13;be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generation of future taxable income during the&#13;periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Due to the uncertainty of the realizability of the deferred tax&#13;assets

 GAAP requires the disclosure of fair value information about&#13;financial instruments that are not measured at fair value. Financial instruments consist principally of trade receivables

The Company regularly monitors inventory quantities on hand and records write-downs&#13;for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on the Company&amp;#8217;s estimated forecast of product demand and production&#13;requirements. Such write-downs establish a new cost basis of accounting for the related inventory. The Company recorded write-downs&#13;of inventory of $0.3 million and $Nil for the years ended December 31

 the Company has the option to sell certain customer account&#13;receivables in advance of payment for 75% (spirits program) or 85% (co-packing program) of the amount due. When the customer remits&#13;payment
 the Company receives the remaining balance. For the spirits program
 interest is charged on the advanced 75% payment&#13;at a rate of 2.4% for the first 30 days plus 1.44% for each additional ten-day period. For the co-packing program
 interest is&#13;charged against the greater of $500
000 or the total funds advanced at a rate of 5% plus the prime rate published in the Wall&#13;Street Journal. Under the terms of both agreements
 the factoring provider has full recourse against the Company should the customer&#13;fail to pay the invoice. In accordance with ASC 860
 we have concluded that these agreements have met all three conditions identified&#13;in ASC 860-10-40-5 (a) &amp;#8211; (c) and have accounted for this activity as a sale. Given the quality of the factored accounts
&#13;the Company has not recognized a recourse obligation. In certain limited instances
 the Company may provide collection services&#13;on the factored accounts but does not receive any fees for acting as the collection agent
 and as such
 the Company has not recognized&#13;a service obligation asset or liability. The Company factored $2.2 million of invoices and incurred $0.1 million in fees associated&#13;with the factoring programs during the year ended December 31

&#13;the retail operations will not be reported as discontinued operations as of December 31


 the Financial Accounting Standards&#13;Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) issued &lt;i&gt;Accounting Standards Update (&amp;#8220;ASU&amp;#8221;) 2016-15
 Statement of Cash Flows &amp;#8211; Classification&#13;of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments &lt;/i&gt;(&amp;#8220;ASU 2016-15&amp;#8221;) and in November 2016 issued &lt;i&gt;ASU 2016-18
 Statement&#13;of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash&lt;/i&gt; (&amp;#8220;ASU 2016-18&amp;#8221;). The new standards are effective for fiscal years beginning&#13;after December 15
 2017
 and interim periods within those fiscal years and amend the existing accounting standards for the statement&#13;of cash flows. The amendments provide guidance on the following nine cash flow issues: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs;&#13;settlement of zero-coupon or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective&#13;interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement&#13;of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies; distributions received from equity&#13;method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; separately identifiable cash flows and application of the&#13;predominance principle; and restricted cash. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 and ASU 2016-18 on January 1

 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09
 which&#13;superseded virtually all existing revenue guidance. Under this update
 an entity is required to recognize revenue upon transfer&#13;of promised goods or services to customers
 in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those&#13;goods or services. As such
 an entity will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the current guidance. ASU&#13;2014-09 is to be applied retrospectively either to each prior reporting period presented in the financial statements
 or only to&#13;the most current reporting period presented in the financial statements with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings.&#13;The Company elected to apply ASU 2014-09 with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings. In August 2015
 the FASB issued&#13;ASU No. 2015-14
 &lt;i&gt;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date &lt;/i&gt;(&amp;#8220;ASU 2015-14&amp;#8221;).&#13;ASU 2015-14 deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year
 making it effective for the year beginning December 31
 2017
&#13;with early adoption permitted as of January 1
 2017. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 as of January 1

 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
&#13;&lt;i&gt;Leases (Topic 842)&lt;/i&gt; (&amp;#8220;ASU 2016-02&amp;#8221;)&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; Under the new guidance

 which is a lessee&amp;#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
 measured on a discounted basis; and&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#13;&lt;tr&gt;&#13;    &lt;td style=text-align: justify&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&#13;    &lt;td style=vertical-align: top; text-align: justify&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&#13;    &lt;td style=text-align: justify&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#13;&lt;tr&gt;&#13;    &lt;td style=text-align: justify&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&#13;    &lt;td style=vertical-align: top; text-align: justify&gt;&lt;font style=font-size: 10pt&gt;-&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#13;    &lt;td style=text-align: justify&gt;&lt;font style=font-size: 10pt&gt;A right-of-use asset
 which is an asset that represents the lessee&amp;#8217;s right to use
 or control the use of

 lessor accounting will&#13;be largely unchanged. Certain targeted improvements were made to align
 where necessary
 lessor accounting with the lessee accounting&#13;model and ASU No. 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The new lease guidance simplified the accounting for sale and&#13;leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Lessees will no longer be provided&#13;with a source of off-balance sheet financing. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years&#13;beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years (i.e.
 January 1
 2019
 for a calendar year&#13;entity). Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type
 direct financing
 and operating leases) must apply&#13;a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the beginning of the earliest comparative&#13;period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for&#13;leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition&#13;approach. In July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-11
 &lt;i&gt;Leases (Topic 842). &lt;/i&gt;This guidance provides an additional (and optional)&#13;transition method whereby the new lease standard is applied at the adoption date and recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings.&#13;In addition
 this ASU provides a practical expedient
 by class of underlying asset
 to not separate nonlease components from the&#13;associated lease and instead account for the lease as a single component if both the timing and pattern of transfer of the nonlease&#13;component(s) are the same
 and if the lease would be classified as an operating lease. These amendments have the same effective&#13;date as ASU 2016-02. On January 1
 2019
 the Company adopted the new accounting standard using the modified retrospective approach&#13;and elected to not adjust comparative periods. Upon adoption
 the Company recognized right-of-use assets of $0.9 million
 lease&#13;liabilities of $1.1 million

 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07
&#13;&lt;i&gt;Compensation &amp;#8211; Stock Compensation (Topic 718) &amp;#8211; Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting&lt;/i&gt;&#13;(&amp;#8220;ASU 2018-07&amp;#8221;)
 which aligns the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to employees and nonemployees.&#13;Under ASU 2018-07
 the existing employee guidance will apply to nonemployee share-based transactions (as long as the transaction&#13;is not effectively a form of financing)
 with the exception of specific guidance related to the attribution of compensation cost.&#13;The cost of nonemployee awards will continue to be recorded as if the grantor had paid cash for the goods or services. In addition
&#13;the contractual term will be able to be used in lieu of an expected term in the option-pricing model for nonemployee awards. The&#13;new standard became effective on January 1
 2019 and should be applied to all new awards granted after the date of adoption. The&#13;Company adopted ASU 2018-07 as of January 1


 the FASB issued ASU 2017-04
&#13;&lt;i&gt;Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) &amp;#8211; Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment&lt;/i&gt; (&amp;#8220;ASU 2017-04&amp;#8221;).&#13;ASU 2017-04 will simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Current&#13;guidance requires that companies compute the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2 by performing procedures to determine&#13;the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities following the procedure that would be required in&#13;determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. ASU 2017-04 will require companies&#13;to perform annual or interim goodwill impairment tests by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount&#13;and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&amp;#8217;s fair value.&#13;However
 the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 will&#13;be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 including interim periods within those fiscal years

 establishes a framework
for measuring fair value
 and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. GAAP permits an entity to choose to measure
many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and contains financial statement presentation and disclosure requirements
for assets and liabilities for which the fair value option is elected. At December 31
 2019 and December 31
 2018
 management has
not elected to report any of the Company&#8217;s assets or liabilities at fair value under the &#8220;fair value option&#8221;
provided by GAAP.


under GAAP provides for three levels: Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value
 whereas Level 3
 if applicable
generally would require significant management judgment. The three levels for categorizing assets and liabilities under GAAP&#8217;s
fair value measurement requirements are as follows:



    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
Fair value of the asset or liability is determined using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the applicable asset or liability
 either directly or indirectly
 such as quoted prices for similar (as opposed to identical) assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.

    
    
    

    
    
    



were measured at fair value at December 31
 2019 or 2018. However
 GAAP requires the disclosure of fair value information about
financial instruments that are not measured at fair value. Financial instruments consist principally of trade receivables
 accounts
payable
 accrued liabilities
 note payable
 and convertible note payable. The estimated fair value of trade receivables
 accounts
payable
 and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to the short period of time to their maturities. At December
31
 2019 and December 31
 2018
 the Company&#8217;s notes are payable at fixed rates and their carrying value approximates fair
value.

which approximates cost under the first-in
 first-out (FIFO) method. A portion of inventory is held by certain independent distributors
on consignment until it is sold to a third party. The Company regularly monitors inventory quantities on hand and records write-downs
for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on the Company&#8217;s estimated forecast of product demand and production
requirements. Such write-downs establish a new cost basis of accounting for the related inventory. The Company recorded write-downs
of inventory of $0.3 million and $Nil for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.




accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the assets
 ranging from three to seven years. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method
over the life of the lease or the useful lives of the assets
 whichever is shorter. The cost and related accumulated depreciation
and amortization of property and equipment sold or otherwise disposed of are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is
reported as current period income or expense. The costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If there is an indication
of impairment
 management would prepare an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to
result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these estimated cash flows were less than the carrying amount
an impairment loss would be recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The Company performed a qualitative
assessment of goodwill at December 31
 2019 and determined that goodwill was not impaired.

management would prepare an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the

income and expenses as reported for financial statement purposes using the &#8220;asset and liability method&#8221; for accounting
for deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets
or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled.


deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. A valuation allowance
 if needed
 reduces
deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. At December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company established valuation allowances
against its net deferred tax assets.


recognition threshold are measured at the largest amount of income tax benefit that is more than 50 % likely to be realized upon
settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with income tax positions taken that exceeds
the amount measured as described above would be reflected as a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon
examination. Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits would be classified as additional income taxes
in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. There were no unrecognized income tax benefits
 nor any interest and
penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits

the TTB regulations
 which includes making timely and accurate excise tax payments. The Company is subject to periodic compliance
audits by the TTB. Individual states also impose excise taxes on alcoholic beverages in varying amounts. The Company calculates
its excise tax expense based upon units produced and on its understanding of the applicable excise tax laws. Excise taxes totaled
$0.8 million and $0.7 million in years 2019 and 2018
 respectively.




all stock-based awards issued to employees. The compensation cost is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the related
stock-based awards and is recognized over the service period of stock-based awards
 which is generally the same as the vesting
period. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model
 which estimates the fair value of
each award on the date of grant based on a variety of assumptions including expected stock price volatility
 expected terms of
the awards
 risk-free interest rate
 and dividend rates
 if applicable. Stock-based awards issued to nonemployees are recorded
at fair value on the measurement date and are subject to periodic market adjustments at the end of each reporting period and as
the underlying stock-based awards vest. Stock-based compensation was $0.7 million and $0.7 million in fiscal years 2019 and 2018
respectively.




factoring programs. One for its spirits customers (the &#8220;spirits program&#8221;) and another for its co-packing customers
(the &#8220;co-packing program&#8221;). Under the programs
 the Company has the option to sell certain customer account receivables
in advance of payment for 75% (spirits program) or 85% (co-packing program) of the amount due. When the customer remits payment
the Company receives the remaining balance. For the spirits program
 interest is charged on the advanced 75% payment at a rate
of 2.4% for the first 30 days plus 1.44% for each additional ten-day period. For the co-packing program
 interest is charged against
the greater of $500
000 or the total funds advanced at a rate of 5% plus the prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal. Under
the terms of both agreements
 the factoring provider has full recourse against the Company should the customer fail to pay the
invoice. In accordance with ASC 860
 we have concluded that these agreements have met all three conditions identified in ASC 860-10-40-5
(a) &#8211; (c) and have accounted for this activity as a sale. Given the quality of the factored accounts
 the Company has not
recognized a recourse obligation. In certain limited instances
 the Company may provide collection services on the factored accounts
but does not receive any fees for acting as the collection agent
 and as such
 the Company has not recognized a service obligation
asset or liability. The Company factored $2.2 million of invoices and incurred $0.1 million in fees associated with the factoring
programs during the year ended December 31
 2019. At December 31
 2019
 the Company had $0.6 million factored invoices outstanding.

 management made a strategic shift to focus the Company&#8217;s sale and marketing efforts
on the nationally branded product platform
 resulting in the decision to close all four of its retail stores in the Portland

 the Financial Accounting Standards

 Statement of Cash Flows &#8211; Classification
ASU 2016-18
 Statement
of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash
after December 15
 2017
 and interim periods within those fiscal years and amend the existing accounting standards for the statement
of cash flows. The amendments provide guidance on the following nine cash flow issues: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs;
settlement of zero-coupon or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective
interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement
of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies; distributions received from equity
method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; separately identifiable cash flows and application of the
predominance principle; and restricted cash. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 and ASU 2016-18 on January 1
 2018 did not have a material
effect on the consolidated financial statements.


 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09
 which
superseded virtually all existing revenue guidance. Under this update
 an entity is required to recognize revenue upon transfer
of promised goods or services to customers
 in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those
goods or services. As such
 an entity will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the current guidance. ASU
2014-09 is to be applied retrospectively either to each prior reporting period presented in the financial statements
 or only to
the most current reporting period presented in the financial statements with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings.
The Company elected to apply ASU 2014-09 with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings. In August 2015
 the FASB issued
ASU No. 2015-14
(&#8220;ASU 2015-14&#8221;).
ASU 2015-14 deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year
 making it effective for the year beginning December 31
 2017
with early adoption permitted as of January 1
 2017. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 as of January 1
 2018. The Company does not
believe the adoption of ASU 2014-09 had any material impact on its consolidated financial statements.


 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
 Under the new guidance
 lessees will be required to recognize the
following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date:



    
    
A lease liability
 which is a lessee&#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
 measured on a discounted basis; and

    
    
    

    
    
A right-of-use asset
 which is an asset that represents the lessee&#8217;s right to use
 or control the use of
 a specified asset for the lease term.



 lessor accounting will
be largely unchanged. Certain targeted improvements were made to align
 where necessary
 lessor accounting with the lessee accounting
model and ASU No. 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The new lease guidance simplified the accounting for sale and
leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Lessees will no longer be provided
with a source of off-balance sheet financing. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years
beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years (i.e.
 January 1
 2019
 for a calendar year
entity). Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type
 direct financing
 and operating leases) must apply
a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the beginning of the earliest comparative
period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for
leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition
approach. In July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-11
This guidance provides an additional (and optional)
transition method whereby the new lease standard is applied at the adoption date and recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings.
In addition
 this ASU provides a practical expedient
 by class of underlying asset
 to not separate nonlease components from the
associated lease and instead account for the lease as a single component if both the timing and pattern of transfer of the nonlease
component(s) are the same
 and if the lease would be classified as an operating lease. These amendments have the same effective
date as ASU 2016-02. On January 1
 2019
 the Company adopted the new accounting standard using the modified retrospective approach
and elected to not adjust comparative periods. Upon adoption
 the Company recognized right-of-use assets of $0.9 million
 lease
liabilities of $1.1 million
 and a net adjustment to retained earnings of $0.2 million. The Company considers the impact of the
adoption to be immaterial to its consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis.


 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07
 (&#8220;ASU
2018-07&#8221;)
 which aligns the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to employees and nonemployees. Under ASU 2018-07
the existing employee guidance will apply to nonemployee share-based transactions (as long as the transaction is not effectively
a form of financing)
 with the exception of specific guidance related to the attribution of compensation cost. The cost of nonemployee
awards will continue to be recorded as if the grantor had paid cash for the goods or services. In addition
 the contractual term
will be able to be used in lieu of an expected term in the option-pricing model for nonemployee awards. The new standard became
effective on January 1
 2019 and should be applied to all new awards granted after the date of adoption. The Company adopted ASU
2018-07 as of January 1
 2019. The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2018-07 had any material impact on its consolidated
financial statements.




 the FASB issued ASU 2017-04
 (&#8220;ASU 2017-04&#8221;).
ASU 2017-04 will simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Current
guidance requires that companies compute the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2 by performing procedures to determine
the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities following the procedure that would be required in
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. ASU 2017-04 will require companies
to perform annual or interim goodwill impairment tests by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount
and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value.
However
 the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 will
be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 including interim periods within those fiscal years
 and will
be applied prospectively. Early adoption of this standard is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating
the impact of ASU 2017-04 on its consolidated financial statements.

Tabular disclosure of warrants or rights issued. Warrants and rights outstanding are derivative securities that give the holder the right to purchase securities (usually equity) from the issuer at a specific price within a certain time frame. Warrants are often included in a new debt issue to entice investors by a higher return potential. The main difference between warrants and call options is that warrants are issued and guaranteed by the company
 whereas options are exchange instruments and are not issued by the company. Also
 the lifetime of a warrant is often measured in years
 while the lifetime of a typical option is measured in months. Disclose the title of issue of securities called for by warrants and rights outstanding

that require management&#8217;s judgment. The expected term of the options is calculated using the simplified method described
in GAAP. The simplified method defines the expected term as the average of the contractual term and the vesting period. Estimated
volatility is derived from volatility calculated using historical closing prices of common shares of similar entities whose share
prices are publicly available for the expected term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury constant

in a large
 international spirits marketplace occupied by large multi-national conglomerates
 we seek to utilize our size and our
public company stature to our advantage and position Eastside Distilling as a leading tier 2 spirits provider by acquiring and
developing brands
 growing them to a national presence and positioning them for sale to the tier 1 suppliers to the market. This
strategy was demonstrated by the launch of our Redneck Riviera Brand (RRW) in conjunction with&#160;our branding partners
&#160;Sandstrom
Partners in 2018. This demonstrated how our team can leverage its position to launch nascent or new brands and grow them more quickly
than the tier 1 larger conglomerates because we are able to focus and dedicate more of our attention to developing
innovative products. Our RRW brand went from idea
 to market roll-out in less than nine months and achieved national distribution
in 49 states in 18 months.&#160;In September 2019
 we acquired the Azu&#241;ia tequila brand and have begun to distribute this
brand through our national platform.


we used our shares to acquire 90% of Big Bottom Distilling
 LLC (&#8220;BBD&#8221;)
 known for its award-winning
 super-premium
gins and whiskeys
 and American Single Malt Whiskey. BBD&#8217;s super-premium spirits give us a presence at the &#8220;ultra-premium
segment&#8221; of the market. In December 2018
 we acquired the remaining 10% of BBD. In September 2019
 we also acquired the
high-end
 luxury tequila brand
 Azu&#241;ia
 to complement our portfolio and provide us with a larger established brand in the
high-growth tequila category. In addition
 through MotherLode Craft Distillery (&#8220;MotherLode&#8221;)
 our wholly-owned subsidiary
acquired in March 2017 and Craft Canning + Bottling
 LLC (formerly known as Craft Canning
 LLC) (&#8220;Craft Canning&#8221;)
which we acquired in January 2019
 we provide contract bottling
 canning
 and packaging services for existing and emerging beer
wine and spirits producers. We have used our&#160;mobile&#160;canning&#160;operations&#160;to profit from the rapid growth
in the canned beverages industry (beer

outstanding and the potential number of any dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities
consist of the incremental common stock issuable upon exercise of stock options and convertible notes. Potentially dilutive securities

which include sales to the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC)
 the Company recognizes sales upon the consignee&#8217;s shipment
to the customer. Postage and handling charges billed to customers are also recognized as sales upon shipment of the related merchandise.
Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point
 and title passes to the customer at the time and place of shipment or purchase
by customers at a retail location. For consignment sales
 title passes to the consignee concurrent with the consignee&#8217;s shipment
to the customer. The customer has no cancellation privileges after shipment or upon purchase at retail locations
 other than customary
rights of return. The Company excludes sales tax collected and remitted to various states from sales and cost of sales. Sales from
items sold through the Company&#8217;s retail locations are recognized at the time of sale.

 establishes a framework
for measuring fair value
 and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. GAAP permits an entity to choose to measure
many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and contains financial statement presentation and disclosure requirements
for assets and liabilities for which the fair value option is elected. At December 31
 2019 and December 31
 2018
 management has
not elected to report any of the Company&#8217;s assets or liabilities at fair value under the &#8220;fair value option&#8221;
provided by GAAP.


under GAAP provides for three levels: Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value
 whereas Level 3
 if applicable
generally would require significant management judgment. The three levels for categorizing assets and liabilities under GAAP&#8217;s
fair value measurement requirements are as follows:



    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
Fair value of the asset or liability is determined using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the applicable asset or liability
 either directly or indirectly
 such as quoted prices for similar (as opposed to identical) assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.

    
    
    

    
    
    



were measured at fair value at December 31
 2019 or 2018. However
 GAAP requires the disclosure of fair value information about
financial instruments that are not measured at fair value. Financial instruments consist principally of trade receivables
 accounts
payable
 accrued liabilities
 note payable
 and convertible note payable. The estimated fair value of trade receivables
 accounts
payable
 and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to the short period of time to their maturities. At December
31
 2019 and December 31
 2018
 the Company&#8217;s notes are payable at fixed rates and their carrying value approximates fair
value.

bottled liquor and merchandise and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using an average costing methodology
which approximates cost under the first-in
 first-out (FIFO) method. A portion of inventory is held by certain independent distributors
on consignment until it is sold to a third party. The Company regularly monitors inventory quantities on hand and records write-downs
for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on the Company&#8217;s estimated forecast of product demand and production
requirements. Such write-downs establish a new cost basis of accounting for the related inventory. The Company recorded write-downs
of inventory of $0.3 million and $Nil for the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 respectively.








accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the assets
 ranging from three to seven years. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method
over the life of the lease or the useful lives of the assets
 whichever is shorter. The cost and related accumulated depreciation
and amortization of property and equipment sold or otherwise disposed of are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is
reported as current period income or expense. The costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.








including property and equipment and intangible assets
 at amortized cost. Management reviews long-lived assets for probable impairment
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If there is an indication
of impairment
 management would prepare an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected
to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these estimated cash flows were less than the carrying amount
an impairment loss would be recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The Company performed a qualitative
assessment of goodwill at December 31
 2019 and determined that goodwill was not impaired.








including property and equipment
 at amortized cost. Management reviews long-lived assets for probable impairment whenever events
or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If there is an indication of impairment

the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these estimated cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset

income and expenses as reported for financial statement purposes using the &#8220;asset and liability method&#8221; for accounting
for deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets
or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled.


deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. A valuation allowance
 if needed
 reduces
deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. At December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company established valuation allowances
against its net deferred tax assets.


recognition threshold are measured at the largest amount of income tax benefit that is more than 50 % likely to be realized upon
settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with income tax positions taken that exceeds
the amount measured as described above would be reflected as a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon
examination. Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits would be classified as additional income taxes
in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. There were no unrecognized income tax benefits
 nor any interest and
penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits
 accrued or expensed at and for the years ended December 31
 2019 and
2018.

with the TTB regulations
 which includes making timely and accurate excise tax payments. The Company is subject to periodic compliance
audits by the TTB. Individual states also impose excise taxes on alcoholic beverages in varying amounts. The Company calculates
its excise tax expense based upon units produced and on its understanding of the applicable excise tax laws. Excise taxes totaled
$0.8 million and $0.7 million in years 2019 and 2018
 respectively.








all stock-based awards issued to employees. The compensation cost is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the related
stock-based awards and is recognized over the service period of stock-based awards
 which is generally the same as the vesting
period. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model
 which estimates the fair value
of each award on the date of grant based on a variety of assumptions including expected stock price volatility
 expected terms
of the awards
 risk-free interest rate
 and dividend rates
 if applicable. Stock-based awards issued to nonemployees are recorded
at fair value on the measurement date and are subject to periodic market adjustments at the end of each reporting period and as
the underlying stock-based awards vest. Stock-based compensation was $0.7 million and $0.7 million in fiscal years 2019 and 2018
respectively.








receivable factoring programs. One for its spirits customers (the &#8220;spirits program&#8221;) and another for its co-packing
customers (the &#8220;co-packing program&#8221;). Under the programs
 the Company has the option to sell certain customer account
receivables in advance of payment for 75% (spirits program) or 85% (co-packing program) of the amount due. When the customer remits
payment
 the Company receives the remaining balance. For the spirits program
 interest is charged on the advanced 75% payment
at a rate of 2.4% for the first 30 days plus 1.44% for each additional ten-day period. For the co-packing program
 interest is
charged against the greater of $500
000 or the total funds advanced at a rate of 5% plus the prime rate published in the Wall
Street Journal. Under the terms of both agreements
 the factoring provider has full recourse against the Company should the customer
fail to pay the invoice. In accordance with ASC 860
 we have concluded that these agreements have met all three conditions identified
in ASC 860-10-40-5 (a) &#8211; (c) and have accounted for this activity as a sale. Given the quality of the factored accounts
the Company has not recognized a recourse obligation. In certain limited instances
 the Company may provide collection services
on the factored accounts but does not receive any fees for acting as the collection agent
 and as such
 the Company has not recognized
a service obligation asset or liability. The Company factored $2.2 million of invoices and incurred $0.1 million in fees associated
with the factoring programs during the year ended December 31
 2019. At December 31
 2019
 the Company had $0.6 million factored
invoices outstanding.

: (1) Component of an entity; (2) Held for sale criteria;
(3) Strategic shift. On December 31
 2019
 management made a strategic shift to focus the Company&#8217;s sale and marketing efforts
on the nationally branded product platform
 resulting in the decision to close all four of its retail stores in the Portland
Oregon area. Although this decision meets the criteria (1) and (3) for reporting discontinued operations
 it does not meet the
(2) Held for sale criteria until the retail stores are closed / abandoned
 which is planned to occur by March 31
 2020. As a result
the retail operations will not be reported as discontinued operations as of December 31
 2019.

 Statement
of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash
after December 15

 and interim periods within those fiscal years and amend the existing accounting standards for the statement

settlement of zero-coupon or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective
interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement
of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies; distributions received from equity

predominance principle; and restricted cash. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 and ASU 2016-18 on January 1
 2018 did not have a material
effect on the consolidated financial statements.


 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09
 which
superseded virtually all existing revenue guidance. Under this update
 an entity is required to recognize revenue upon transfer
of promised goods or services to customers
 in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those
goods or services. As such
 an entity will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the current guidance. ASU
2014-09 is to be applied retrospectively either to each prior reporting period presented in the financial statements
 or only to
the most current reporting period presented in the financial statements with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings.
The Company elected to apply ASU 2014-09 with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings. In August 2015
 the FASB issued
ASU No. 2015-14
(&#8220;ASU 2015-14&#8221;).
ASU 2015-14 deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year
 making it effective for the year beginning December 31
 2017
with early adoption permitted as of January 1
 2017. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 as of January 1
 2018. The Company does not
believe the adoption of ASU 2014-09 had any material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

 which is a lessee&#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease
 measured on a discounted basis; and

    
    
    

    
    
A right-of-use asset
 which is an asset that represents the lessee&#8217;s right to use
 or control the use of
 a specified asset for the lease term.



 lessor accounting will
be largely unchanged. Certain targeted improvements were made to align
 where necessary
 lessor accounting with the lessee accounting
model and ASU No. 2014-09
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The new lease guidance simplified the accounting for sale and
leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Lessees will no longer be provided
with a source of off-balance sheet financing. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years
beginning after December 15
 2018
 including interim periods within those fiscal years (i.e.
 January 1
 2019
 for a calendar year
entity). Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type
 direct financing
 and operating leases) must apply
a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at
 or entered into after
 the beginning of the earliest comparative
period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for
leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition
approach. In July 2018
 the FASB issued ASU 2018-11
This guidance provides an additional (and optional)
transition method whereby the new lease standard is applied at the adoption date and recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings.
In addition
 this ASU provides a practical expedient
 by class of underlying asset
 to not separate nonlease components from the
associated lease and instead account for the lease as a single component if both the timing and pattern of transfer of the nonlease
component(s) are the same
 and if the lease would be classified as an operating lease. These amendments have the same effective
date as ASU 2016-02. On January 1
 2019
 the Company adopted the new accounting standard using the modified retrospective approach
and elected to not adjust comparative periods. Upon adoption
 the Company recognized right-of-use assets of $0.9 million
 lease
liabilities of $1.1 million
 and a net adjustment to retained earnings of $0.2 million. The Company considers the impact of the
adoption to be immaterial to its consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis.


 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07

(&#8220;ASU 2018-07&#8221;)
 which aligns the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to employees and nonemployees.
Under ASU 2018-07
 the existing employee guidance will apply to nonemployee share-based transactions (as long as the transaction
is not effectively a form of financing)
 with the exception of specific guidance related to the attribution of compensation cost.
The cost of nonemployee awards will continue to be recorded as if the grantor had paid cash for the goods or services. In addition
the contractual term will be able to be used in lieu of an expected term in the option-pricing model for nonemployee awards. The
new standard became effective on January 1
 2019 and should be applied to all new awards granted after the date of adoption. The
Company adopted ASU 2018-07 as of January 1
 2019. The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2018-07 had any material impact
on its consolidated financial statements.








 the FASB issued ASU 2017-04
 (&#8220;ASU 2017-04&#8221;).
ASU 2017-04 will simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Current
guidance requires that companies compute the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2 by performing procedures to determine
the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities following the procedure that would be required in
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. ASU 2017-04 will require companies
to perform annual or interim goodwill impairment tests by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount
and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value.
However
 the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 will
be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2019
 including interim periods within those fiscal years
 and will
be applied prospectively. Early adoption of this standard is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating
the impact of ASU 2017-04 on its consolidated financial statements.

The estimated measure of the percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends

Organization
 Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]









 the Company
has funded its cash and liquidity needs through&#160;operating cash flow&#160;convertible notes
 extended credit terms
 and equity
financings. For the years ended December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the Company incurred a net loss of approximately&#160;$16.9&#160;million
and $9.0 million
 respectively
 and has an accumulated deficit of approximately&#160;$44.2&#160;million as of December 31
 2019.
The Company has been dependent on raising capital from debt and equity financings to meet its needs for cash flow used in operating
activities. For the year ended December 31
 2019
 we raised approximately&#160;$2.5&#160;million in additional capital through
equity and debt financing (net of repayments).


 2019
 we
had $0.3 million of cash on hand with a positive working capital of $8.3 million. Our ability to meet our ongoing operating cash
needs over the next 12 months depends on reducing our operating costs
 raising additional debt or equity capital and generating
positive operating cash flow
 primarily through increased sales
 improved profit growth and controlling expenses. We intend to
implement actions to improve profitability
 by managing expenses while continuing to increase sales. Additionally
 we are seeking
to leverage our large inventory balances and our accounts receivable balance to help satisfy its working capital needs over the
next 12 months. See Notes 10
 11 and 18 to our financial statements for a description of our debt and the debt refinancing initiatives
completed in the first quarter of 2020. If we are unable to obtain additional financing
 or additional financing is not available
on acceptable terms
 we may seek to sell assets
 reduce operating expenses or reduce or eliminate marketing initiatives
 and take
other measures that could impair our ability to be successful.




































The entire disclosure when substantial doubt is raised about the ability to continue as a going concern. Includes
 but is not limited to
 principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern
 management's evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the ability to meet its obligations
 and management's plans that alleviated or are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern.

 2019
 the Company has a cumulative
net operating loss carryforward (NOL) of approximately $37.8 million
 to offset against future income for federal and state tax
purposes. These federal and state NOLs can be carried forward for 20 and 15 years
 respectively. The federal NOLs begin to expire
in 2034
 and the state NOLs begin to expire in 2029. The utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to
substantial annual limitation due to ownership change provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended
 the Internal
Revenue Code) and similar state provisions. In general
 if the Company experiences a greater than 50 percentage aggregate change
in ownership of certain significant stockholders over a three-year period (a &#8220;Section 382 ownership change&#8221;)
 utilization
of its pre-change NOL carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (and similar
state laws). The annual limitation generally is determined by multiplying the value of the Company&#8217;s stock at the time of
such ownership change (subject to certain adjustments) by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate. Such limitations may result
in expiration of a portion of the NOL carryforwards before utilization and may be substantial.


tax assets
 management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not
be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generation of future taxable income during the
periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Due to the uncertainty of the realizability of the deferred tax
assets
 management has determined a full valuation allowance is appropriate.



































The entire disclosure for income taxes. Disclosures may include net deferred tax liability or asset recognized in an enterprise's statement of financial position
 net change during the year in the total valuation allowance
 approximate tax effect of each type of temporary difference and carryforward that gives rise to a significant portion of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets
 utilization of a tax carryback
 and tax uncertainties information.
