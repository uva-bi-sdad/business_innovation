&#160; Inc.
 (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada
 on June 10
 1977. The purposes for which the corporation was organized were: (1) to engage in any lawful business from time to time authorized by the board of directors
 (2) to act as principal
 agent
 partner or joint venturer or in any other capacity in any transaction
 (3) to do business anywhere in the world
 and (4) to have and exercise all rights and powers from time to time granted to the corporation by law. From 1977 until 1981 the Company was dormant and undertook no activities. Beginning in 1982 the Company explored the option of entering into a joint venture to develop a mercury mining property at Mercury Mountain
 Nevada. As a part of these activities the Company
 through the sale of its common stock
 raised funds to engage the services of an independent mining engineer to prepare a report on the feasibility of the project. By late 1983 it had been determined that the project did not warrant any further investment. From that time until 1997 the Company's activities concentrated on maintaining its corporate existence and looking for other opportunities for the Company. In May of 1997 new management was appointed
 a shareholders' meeting was held
 amendments to the Company's articles of incorporation were approved
 and additional effort was made by new management to make the Company a viable merger candidate. These efforts included engaging the services of a certified Public Accounting firm to audit the Company's financial statements
 obtaining an Opinion of Counsel as to the tradability of the Company's outstanding shares
 preparation of the information required by Rule 15c2-11




 no viable acquisitions or merger candidates had been located for the Company and management became aware that the Company would be required to register its shares under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in order to maintain its stock on the OTC Bulletin Board. Management determined that the Company needed new management which might be better positioned to find a suitable acquisition or merger candidate and which would be in a position of funding the upcoming expenses of the Company. On September 1
 1999 management of the Company resigned and Claudio Gianascio was appointed as sole director and officer. On November 9
 1999 the Company sold 700
000 of its common stock to Mr. Gianascio for $.05 per share
 netting a total of $35
000. On November 18




000&#160; consisting&#160; of 100
000 shares of $.25 par value common stock. On June 10
 1997 the shareholders approved an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation of The Company changing the authorized capital to 100
000
000 shares at a par value of $.001 and providing for a 10 to 1 share forward split of the outstanding shares. The Articles of Amendment were filed with the State of Nevada on August 6




 the Company completed a private placement of 2
500
000 units for which it received $250
000 Each unit consisted of one share of common stock; one a warrant giving the holder thereof the right to purchase
 upon a minimum of 60 days prior notice of exercise
 one share of common stock at $.10 per share within two years of the date of issuance; and one b warrant giving the holder thereof the right to purchase
 upon a minimum of 60 days prior notice of exercise











&#160; properties or businesses to acquire
&#160; the Company has had no business&#160; operations&#160; since&#160; inception. To provide revenue on an interim basis
 the Company has held its funds in interest bearing bank accounts
 made short term loans to reputable unaffiliated corporations




&#160; property&#160; or&#160; business&#160; that may benefit the Company and its&#160; stockholders
&#160; it is&#160; essentially&#160; a blank&#160; check company.&#160; Because&#160; the&#160; Company has&#160; limited&#160; assets and&#160; conducts no&#160; business
 management&#160; anticipates&#160; that any such&#160; acquisition&#160; would&#160; require&#160; it to issue shares of its common stock as the sole&#160; consideration for the acquisition.&#160; This may result in substantial&#160; dilution of the shares of current&#160; stockholders.&#160; The Company's&#160; Board of&#160; Directors&#160; shall&#160; make the final&#160; determination&#160; whether to complete any such&#160; acquisition;&#160; the approval of stockholders will not be sought unless&#160; required by&#160; applicable&#160; laws
&#160; rules and&#160; regulations
&#160; its Articles of Incorporation&#160; or Bylaws




 the Company may be deemed to be a vehicle to acquire or merge with a business or company.&#160; The Company does not intend to restrict its search to any particular business or industry
 and the areas in which it will seek out acquisitions
&#160; reorganizations&#160; or mergers may include
&#160; but will not be limited to
 the fields of high technology
&#160; manufacturing
&#160; natural resources
&#160; service
 research and development
 communications
&#160; transportation
 insurance
 brokerage
 finance and all medically related fields
&#160; among others.&#160; The Company recognizes that the number of suitable potential business ventures that may be available to it may be extremely limited
 and may be restricted to entities who desire to avoid what these entities may deem to be the adverse factors related to an initial public offering (IPO).&#160; The most prevalent of these factors include substantial time requirements
 legal and accounting costs
 the inability to obtain an underwriter who is willing to publicly offer and sell shares
 the lack of or the inability to obtain the&#160; required financial&#160; statements&#160; for such an undertaking
&#160; limitations&#160; on the&#160; amount of&#160; dilution&#160; to public&#160; investors&#160; in comparison to the stockholders of any such entities
 along with other conditions or requirements&#160; imposed by various federal and state securities laws
 rules and regulations.&#160; Any of these types of entities
&#160; regardless of their&#160; prospects
 would require the Company to issue a substantial&#160; number of shares of its common stock to&#160; complete&#160; any such&#160; acquisition
&#160; reorganization&#160; or&#160; merger
&#160; usually amounting to between 80 and 95 percent of the outstanding shares of the Company following the completion of any such transaction;&#160; accordingly
&#160; investments in any such private&#160; entity
&#160; if available




&#160; the Company will be required to file with the Commission&#160; a Current&#160; Report on Form 8-K within the time periods provided for.&#160; A filing on Form 8-K also requires the filing of audited financial statements of the business acquired
 as well as pro forma financial information&#160; consisting of a pro forma condensed balance sheet

 in the case of a new&#160; business&#160; venture&#160; or one&#160; that&#160; is in a&#160; research&#160; and development mode
 the risks will be substantial
&#160; and there will be no objective criteria to examine the&#160; effectiveness or the abilities of its management or its business&#160; objectives.&#160; Also

&#160; the Company may agree to pay a finder's fee or to otherwise&#160; compensate&#160; the persons who submit a potential&#160; business&#160; endeavor in which&#160; the&#160; Company&#160; eventually&#160; participates.&#160; Such persons&#160; may&#160; include&#160; the Company's directors
&#160; executive officers
 beneficial owners or their affiliates. In this&#160; event
&#160; such&#160; fees may&#160; become a factor&#160; in&#160; negotiations&#160; regarding&#160; a potential acquisition and
&#160; accordingly



 the possibility&#160; exists that the Company may acquire or merge with a business or company in which the Company's executive officers
 directors
&#160; beneficial owners or their affiliates may have an ownership interest.&#160; Current Company policy does not prohibit such&#160; transactions.&#160; Because no such transaction is currently contemplated




 substantial fees are often paid in connection with the completion of these types of acquisitions
 reorganizations or mergers
 ranging from a small amount to as much as $250
000. These fees are usually divided among promoters or founders
&#160; after deduction of legal
&#160; accounting and other related expenses
 and it is not&#160; unusual&#160; for a&#160; portion&#160; of&#160; these&#160; fees&#160; to be paid&#160; to&#160; members&#160; of management or to principal&#160; stockholders as consideration for their agreement to retire a portion of the shares of common stock owned by them.&#160; In the event that such fees are paid
&#160; they may&#160; become a factor in&#160; negotiations&#160; regarding&#160; any potential acquisition by the Company and

&#160; and whose only viable business opportunity is that of providing a publicly-held vehicle through which a private entity may have access to the public capital markets. There is no reasonable way to predict the&#160; competitive&#160; position of the Company or any other&#160; entity in the strata of these endeavors;&#160; however
 the Company
 having limited assets and cash reserves
&#160; will no doubt be at a&#160; competitive&#160; disadvantage&#160; in&#160; competing&#160; with entities which have recently&#160; completed&#160; IPO's

 in the event that the Company&#160; engages in a merger or acquisition&#160; transaction&#160; with an entity&#160; that&#160; engages&#160; in&#160; such&#160; activities






















&#160; environmental&#160; laws
 rules and regulations may have an adverse&#160; effect on any business&#160; venture viewed by the Company as an attractive&#160; acquisition
&#160; reorganization or merger candidate
&#160; and these factors may further&#160; limit the number of potential&#160; candidates&#160; available to the Company for acquisition














 The Company has no significant assets or financial resources. The Company will
 in all likelihood
 sustain operating expenses without corresponding revenues



As shown in the accompanying financial statements
 the Company incurred a net loss of $28
152 during year ended December 31
 2016 and accumulated losses of $359
065 since inception at in 1977. The Company's current liabilities exceed its current assets by $4
897 at December 31
 2016. These factors create an uncertainty as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the success of raising additional capital through the issuance of common stock
 borrowing from existing shareholders



&#160; The success of the Company's proposed plan of operation will depend to a great extent on the operations
 financial condition and management of the identified target company. While management will prefer business combinations with entities having established operating histories
 there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in locating candidates meeting such criteria. In the event the Company completes a business combination
 of which there can be no assurance



 A large number of established and well-financed entities
 including venture capital firms
 are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies which may be merger or acquisition target candidates for the Company. Nearly all such entities have significantly greater financial resources
 technical expertise and managerial capabilities than the Company and
 consequently
 the Company will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. Moreover



&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company has no current agreement or understanding with respect to engaging in a merger with or acquisition of a specific business entity. However

 assets
 net worth or other criteria which it will require a target company to have achieved
 or without which the Company would not consider a business combination with such business entity. Accordingly
 the Company may enter into a business combination with a business entity having no significant operating history
 losses
 limited or no potential for immediate earnings
 limited assets









&#160; While seeking a business combination
 management anticipates devoting only a limited amount of time per month to the business of the Company. The Company's sole officer has not entered into a written employment agreement with the Company and he is not expected to do so in the foreseeable future. The Company has not obtained key man life insurance on its officer and director. Notwithstanding the combined limited experience and time commitment of management



 Additional conflicts of interest and non-arms length transactions may also arise in the future.&#160; Management has adopted a policy that the Company will not seek a merger with
 or acquisition of
 any entity in which any member of management serves as an officer
 director or partner



&#160; Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) requires companies subject thereto to provide certain information about significant acquisitions including certified financial statements for the company acquired covering one or two years



&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company has neither conducted
 nor have others made available to it




&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company's proposed operations
 even if successful




&#160; Although the Company will be subject to regulation under the Exchange Act
 management believes the Company will not be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940
 insofar as the Company will not be engaged in the business of investing or trading in securities. In the event the Company engages in business combinations which result in the Company holding passive investment interests in a number of entities
 the Company could be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. In such event
 the Company would be required to register as an investment company and could be expected to incur significant registration and compliance costs. The Company has obtained no formal determination from the Securities and Exchange Commission as to the status of the Company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and
 consequently









&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A business combination involving the issuance of the Company's common stock will
 in all likelihood

 there are no pending acquisitions



&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Company's primary plan of operation is based upon a business combination with a business entity which
 in all likelihood
 will result in the Company issuing securities to shareholders of such business entity.


&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Federal and state tax consequences will
 in all likelihood

 such transactions may be structured so as to result in tax-free treatment to both companies
 pursuant to various federal and state tax provisions. The Company intends to structure any business combination so as to minimize the federal and state tax consequences to both the Company and the target company; however



 One or more attractive business opportunities may choose to forego the possibility of a business combination with the Company rather than incur the expenses associated with preparing audited financial statements. In such case
 the Company may choose to obtain certain assurances as to the target company's assets
 liabilities
 revenues and expenses prior to consummating a business combination

&#160; its&#160; activities&#160; will be limited to keeping itself in good standing in the State of Nevada

To the knowledge&#160; of&#160; management
&#160; no federal
&#160; state or local&#160; governmental&#160; agency is presently&#160; contemplating&#160; any&#160; proceeding&#160; against&#160; the&#160; Company.&#160; No director












 the Company is aware of only a few transactions that have taken place in the previous ten years. In any event




 the Company has no plans to register its securities in any particular state.&#160; Further
 most likely the Company's&#160; shares will be subject to the provisions of Section 15(g) and Rule 15g-9 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 as amended (the Exchange Act)











 subject to certain exceptions.&#160; Rule 3a51-1 provides that any equity security is considered to be a penny stock unless that security is: registered and traded on a national securities exchange meeting specified criteria set by the Commission; authorized for quotation on The NASDAQ Stock Market; issued by a registered investment company; excluded from the definition on the basis of price (at least $5.00 per share) or the issuer's net tangible assets; or exempted from the definition by the Commission.&#160; If the Company's shares are deemed to be a penny stock
 trading in the shares will be subject to additional sales practice requirements on broker- dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors
 generally persons with assets in excess of $1
000
000 or annual income exceeding $200
000
 or $300




 broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and must have received the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase.&#160; Additionally
 for any transaction involving a penny stock
 unless exempt
 the rules require the delivery
 prior to the first transaction
 of a risk disclosure document relating to the penny stock market.&#160; A broker- dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative
 and current quotations for the securities.&#160; Finally
 monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stocks held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.&#160; Consequently













 and until the Company completes any acquisition
 reorganization or merger
 as to which no assurance may be given
 no such policy will be formulated. There are no material restrictions limiting
 or that are likely to limit






















&#160; properties&#160; or businesses&#160; that&#160; may&#160; benefit&#160; the&#160; Company&#160; and&#160; its stockholders. Management intends to focus its efforts outside the United States both because management is located in Europe and because management believes that the Company can locate superior acquisition opportunities outside the United States.&#160; Management anticipates that to achieve any such acquisition










 the Company's only foreseeable cash requirements will relate to maintaining&#160; the&#160; Company in good&#160; standing&#160; or the&#160; payment of expenses&#160; associated&#160; with&#160; reviewing or&#160; investigating&#160; any potential&#160; business venture
&#160; which&#160; the&#160; Company&#160; expects&#160; to pay from its&#160; cash&#160; resources. As of December 31
 2016
 it had $3
234 in cash. Management does not believe that these funds are sufficient to cover its cash needs for the next 12 months. If additional funds are required during this period
 such funds may be advanced&#160; by&#160; management&#160; or stockholders as loans to the Company. Because the Company has not identified any such venture as of the date of this Report
 it is impossible to predict the amount of any such loan.&#160; As of the date of this Report

 accounting and EDGAR filing. The Company
 although more aggressively seeking an acquisition or merger partner and incurring travel and other expenses in relation thereto
 does not anticipate this changing in the next 12 months

 it believes that present officers and shareholders will provide any necessary funds through either the purchase of stock or loans to the Company.&#160; However

 the Company performed an analysis of its previous tax filings and determined that there were no positions taken that it considered uncertain. Therefore
 there was no provision for uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31

 if any
 as part of interest and other expenses in its statements of operations. The Company has incurred no interest or penalties as of December 31

The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 16
For purposes of the statement of cash flows
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures.&#160; Accordingly
ASC 820-10 requires entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments
 both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet
 for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. ASC 820-10 defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. As of December 31
 2016 and 2015
 the carrying value of certain financial instruments approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of such instruments.

 Income Taxes
 the Company performed an analysis of its previous tax filings and determined that there were no positions taken that it considered uncertain. Therefore
 there was no provision for uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31
