 cartons or powdered
 frozen
 flavored
 carbonated and sweetened. With all these choices
it can be confusing and difficult to know if you are choosing the best one. The Company&rsquo;s product competes broadly with all
beverages available to consumers. The coconut water industry is highly competitive with estimated sales in the United States of
1 billion dollars and growing. We estimate that there are approximately 50 bottled coconut water brands in the United States with
sales concentrated among the larger companies
 especially those controlled by PepsiCo and Coca-Cola. Nearly all of our competitors
are more experienced
 have vastly greater financial and management resources and have more established proprietary trademarks and
distribution networks than we do. On a national basis
 we would compete with large beverage companies
 such as PepsiCo (which produces
O.N.E Coconut Water)
 Coca-Cola (which produces Zico coconut water). Other brands include Vito CoCo (partially owned by Red Bull)
Harmless Harvest
 Invo Coconut Water
 Taste Nirvana Coconut water and CocoZona to name a few&nbsp;competitions for market share
in the coconut water industry.&nbsp;These and other competitors are likely to have distribution channels for their products that
we do not have
 which places us at a significant disadvantage. While the Company believes that it can compete favorably on differentiation
providing our proposed organic non-additive coconut water
 we are yet to see if we can compete in quality
 merchandising and are
weak with regards to
 brand name recognition and loyalty
 there can be no assurance that the Company and its product lines will
not experience increasing competitive pressures from both traditional and new age beverage companies
 many of whom have substantially
greater marketing

 distribution
 technical and other resources than the Company.

has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for
the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated revenues and
no revenues are anticipated until we begin selling bottled water. There is no assurance we will ever reach that stage.





    
    






phases
 as follows: (I) develop a business relationship with the Philippine coconut water producer we have identified and contacted;
and conclude an contract with one of the several bottler
 labeler and packer we have sourced; and run an initial production for
marketing purposes while we conduct marketing studies
 initial promotional events
 and generate interest for China WuYi Mountain
Ltd..
 under the brand name &ldquo;Koos Coconut Water&rdquo;; (II) negotiate and enter into supply agreements with retail businesses
merchandisers
 and distributors
 (III) expand proposed operations through-out Oregon
 Washington State and nationally
 (IV) establish
a national and possibly international distributor network and team
 with possibly production facilities or multiple co-packer agreements
.. While we have identified both a supplier and bottler for our proposed product
 we do not have any signed agreements or formal
commitments to obligate any identified company to supply
 bottle
 label and package China WuYi Mountain&rsquo;s proposed coconut
water product. We have not yet commenced any production or activities.

 Ltd. branded product &ldquo;Koos Coconut Water&rdquo; throughout Oregon
 Washington
State and neighboring States to large box store retailers
 convenience stores
 specialty health food stores
 grocery chains
 hotels
and some non-traditional corporate business within this market. The Company is also investigation potential acquisition or merger
targets in the beverage industry. No definite targets have been identified to date.


following the date of this prospectus is to (i) complete Phase I of our program
 which is to develop our a business relationship
with the Philippine coconut water producer we have identified and conclude an contract with one of the several bottler
 labeler
and packer we have sourced
 and run an initial production for marketing purposes while we conduct marketing studies
 initial promotional
events
 and generate interest for China WuYi Mountain

 we anticipate spending $550
000
on program development
 professional and administrative fees
 including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration
statement
 complying with reporting obligations and arranging financing for Phases I and II of our development program. Total expenditures
over the next 12 - 14 months are therefore expected to be approximately $550
000. If we experience a shortage of funds prior to
funding during the next 12 -14 months
 we may utilize funds from shareholder of the Company
 who has informally agreed to advance
funds to allow us to pay for professional fees
 including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement
and operation expenses
 however he has no formal commitment
 arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company.
We will require the funds from this offering to proceed. If we receive only nominal funds from this offering
 we plan to operate
on a limited basis for the limited purpose of meeting our reporting obligations to the Securities and Exchange Commission. No such
plan exists at this time in case of such contingency
 and we cannot guarantee we would be able to raise additional funding if only
nominal funding is obtained from this offering. New management will not as of the date of this filing change its business.


this offering
 we plan to commence activities to raise the $400
000 in funds required for Phase II of the development program in
Februaryof 2020. We expect this phase to take 120 - 180 days to complete and an additional 9 to 12 months for distribution networks
and market acceptance. We cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to proceed
with any work or activities on Phase I and or II of the development program since we currently have no plan in place to raise these
funds. We plan to raise the additional funding for Phase I and Phase II by way of a private debt or equity financing but have not
commenced any activities to raise such funds.

 2018 financial statements expresses an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as an ongoing business.
Since our sole director maybe unwilling or unable to loan or advance us additional capital
 we believe that if we do not raise
additional capital over the next 12 months
 we may be required to suspend or cease the implementation of our business plans. See

from financing activities will be insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. To date the Company
has incurred operating losses since inception of $112
323. As at August 31
 2018
 the Company has a working capital of $12

funds during this time and will seek to raise the necessary additional capital. If we are unable to obtain additional financing

323. As at August 31
 2018
 the Company
has working capital of $12
768. The Company requires additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated
operating losses. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial
business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly
 these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company&rsquo;s
ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue to fund its business by way of private placements and advances
from related parties as may be required. As of August 31
 2018
 the Company has issued 800

000
000 shares of restricted common stock at $0.0075 per share for an aggregate

the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company&rsquo;s net income (loss) available to common
shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number
of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted earnings
(loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company.

 and which cause a change in management's judgment about the realizability of deferred income tax assets

 2017
 new federal tax reform&#13;legislation was enacted in the United States (the &amp;#8220;2017 Tax Act&amp;#8221;)
 resulting in significant changes from previous tax&#13;law. The 2017 Tax Act reduces the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35% effective July 1
 2018 for the Company. The&#13;rate change
 along with certain immaterial changes in tax basis resulting from the 2017 Tax Act
 resulted in a reduction of the&#13;Company&amp;#8217;s deferred tax assets of $4

 2018

The Company&amp;#8217;s policy for classifying interest and&#13;penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits is to include such items as tax expense. No interest or penalties have&#13;been recorded during the year ended August 31
 2018 and August 31
 2017 and no interest or penalties have been accrued as of August&#13;31
 2018 and August 31
