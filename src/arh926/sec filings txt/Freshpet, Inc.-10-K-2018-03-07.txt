 Inc. (&#8220;Freshpet&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is disrupting the $28.0 billion North American pet food industry by driving consumers to reassess conventional dog and cat food offerings that have remained essentially unchanged for decades. We position our brand to benefit from mainstream trends of growing pet humanization and consumer focus on health and wellness. We price our products to be accessible to the average consumer
 providing us with broad demographic appeal and allowing us to penetrate multiple classes of retail
 including grocery (including online)
 mass
 club
 pet specialty and natural. We have successfully expanded our network of Freshpet Fridges within leading blue-chip retail chains. The strength of our business model extends to our customers
 who we believe find that Freshpet grows their pet category sales
 drives higher traffic
 increases shopper frequency and delivers category leading margins. As of December&#160;31
 2017
 Freshpet Fridges were located in over 18
000 stores
 and we believe there is an opportunity to install a Freshpet Fridge in at least 30
000 stores across North America. Additionally
 we believe that there are opportunities to expand our network into international markets as demonstrated with our recent initiatives in the U.K. market.



 we estimate that dog food
 cat food and treats &amp; mixers accounted for retail sales of $28.0 billion. The pet food market has historically been resilient as consumers continue to spend on their pets even during economic downturns. 



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently 84.6 million pet-owning households
 or 68% of total households
 and over 300 million pets in the United States
 according to the American Pet Products Association.
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Packaged Facts
 83% of U.S. pet owners view their pets as members of the family. As pets are increasingly viewed as companions
 friends and family members
pet owners are being transformed into &#8220;pet parents&#8221; who spare no expense for their loved ones
 driving premiumization across pet categories. This trend is reflected in food purchasing decisions. Nearly 80% of U.S. pet owners are as concerned about the quality of their pet&#8217;s food as they are about their own
 according to market researcher Mintel.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Consumers are increasingly purchasing fresh
 natural and organic food products. We believe consumers are seeking simple
 fresh and easy to understand food products from brands they trust and made with ingredients that are transparently sourced. 


 resulting in high repeat purchasing behavior. As a result
 we believe that as consumers try fresh
 refrigerated pet food
 they are likely to become repeat users of the product.



 conventional pet food sold as dry kibble or in wet cans has not changed substantially for decades. We believe that the pet food industry has not kept pace with how consumers think about food for their families
 including their pets. As a result
 consumers are searching for higher quality
 less processed food for their dogs and cats&#8212;meals that measure up to today&#8217;s sensibilities of what actually constitutes &#8220;good food.&#8221; Freshpet was specifically designed to address this growing need with affordable offerings accessible to the average consumer.

 healthy food that we do. We cook our fresh
 nutritious pet food with the same care that we would take in preparing human food. Through the Freshpet Foundation
 we support nutritional research in areas of prevention
 care and treatment of diseases in dogs. Since founding Freshpet
 we have donated over three million fresh meals to pets via shelters
 charitable organizations and humane societies. Our team members get paid time off to pursue activities that help pets in their community. We also participate in Random Acts of Kindness to do our part to improve the lives of pets and pet parents.

 distributors and suppliers by conducting business with honesty and transparency. Additionally
 we strive to help pet owners by providing pet parenting resources.

 cat food and dog treats. All Freshpet products are made according to our nutritional philosophy of fresh
 meat-based nutrition and minimal processing. Our proprietary recipes include real
 fresh meat and varying combinations of vitamin-rich vegetables
 leafy greens and anti-oxidant rich fruits
 without the use of preservatives
 additives or artificial ingredients. Our unique product attributes appeal to diverse consumer needs across multiple classes of retail where Freshpet is sold. Consequently
 our brand resonates across a broad cross-section of pet parent demographics. 

 with ingredients
 packaging and labeling customized by class of trade. Our products are customized to different classes of trade and are available in multiple forms
 including slice and serve rolls
 bagged meals and tubs. 







 refrigerated pet food distributed across North America
 product innovation is core to our strategy. We take a fresh approach to pet food and are not constrained by conventional pet food products
 attributes and production capabilities. We employ a tightly-knit
 creative team of marketing and research and development professionals
 and we consult with outside experts through our Nutrition Council
 which consist of PhD&#8217;s in nutrition and veterinary nutritionists. Our team often identifies pet parents&#8217; needs by evaluating emerging demand trends in both pet food and human food. Our research and development facility located next door to the Freshpet Kitchens tests small batches of new recipes and tries out new cooking techniques. New products are refined iteratively with the help of consumer panel data to arrive at products that we believe can be commercially successful. 

 refrigerated slice and serve rolls
 and over time have steadily expanded into successful new product forms including bags
 tubs and treats. We also introduced new fresh recipes and ingredients
 such as proteins and grain-free options never before seen in pet food that cater to the specific dietary requirements of pets.

 next door to our Freshpet Kitchens manufacturing plant
 helped us ensure that we remain capable of strong innovation including creating new product platforms to expand the breadth of our fresh offerings. We expect that new product introductions will continue to meaningfully drive growth going forward.

 All of our products are manufactured in the United States. We own and operate what we believe to be the first fresh
 refrigerated pet food manufacturing facility in North America
 the Freshpet Kitchens at Bethlehem
 Pennsylvania. This 100
000 square foot facility was built to United States Department of Agriculture standards and houses four production lines customized to produce fresh
 refrigerated food. In 2017
 approximately 94% of our product volume was manufactured by us.
 Our products are made with natural and fresh ingredients including meat
 vegetables
 fruits
 whole grains
 vitamins and minerals. We use high quality food grade plastic packaging materials. Over 60% of our ingredients are sourced locally from within a 200 mile radius of the Freshpet Kitchens
 96% are from North America and none are sourced from China. We maintain rigorous standards for ingredient quality and safety. By volume
 our largest input
 fresh chicken
 represents approximately 50% of total ingredients. In order to retain operating flexibility and negotiating leverage
 we do not enter into exclusivity agreements or long-term commitments with any of our suppliers. All of our suppliers are well-established companies that have the scale to support our growth. For every ingredient
 we either use multiple suppliers or have identified alternative sources of supply that meet our quality and safety standards. 
 Beginning in 2016
 outbound transportation from our facility is handled through a third-party refrigerated freight broker. We expect to be able to leverage certain distribution costs as volumes grow. We use national and regional distributors to cover the grocery (including online)
 mass
 pet specialty and natural retail classes.

 calibrate instruments
 record data and perform corrective actions. Our on-site laboratory has microbial and composition testing capabilities. Quality control approvals are based on a positive release strategy
 wherein a batch can only be shipped when it passes control point record reviews and laboratory testing. At the end of each working day
 a third shift consisting of a cleaning crew sanitizes all equipment that is in contact with food material. Before commencing production the next day
 quality assurance professionals swab equipment to test for potential contaminants. 

 which is the highest standard determined under the Global Food Safety Initiative Benchmarks. We believe our systems and standards for product quality and safety can support our growth and ensure continued success in the market.

 on our ability to implement our growth strategy of expanding distribution by installing new Freshpet Fridges

 and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow or raise capital on acceptable terms to meet our needs. 

 we expect to rely on our cash flow from operations
 our credit facilities
 and other third-party financing. Third-party financing in the future may not
 however
 be available on terms favorable to us
 or at all. Our ability to obtain additional funding will be subject to various factors
 including general market conditions
 our operating performance
 the market&#8217;s perception of our growth potential
 lender sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with other contractual restrictions
 such as financial covenants under our debt documents. 

 our ability to make payments on and to refinance any indebtedness and to fund planned expenditures for our growth plans will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. If our business does not achieve the levels of profitability or generate the amount of cash that we anticipate or if we expand faster than anticipated
 we may need to seek additional debt or equity financing to operate and expand our business. 
We believe that cash and cash equivalents
 expected cash flow from operations and planned borrowing capacity are adequate to fund debt service requirements
 operating lease obligations
 capital expenditures and working capital obligations for the foreseeable future. However
 our ability to continue to meet these requirements and obligations will depend on
 among other things
 our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenue and cash flow from operations and our ability to manage costs and working capital successfully. Additionally
 our cash flow generation ability is subject to general economic
 financial
 competitive
 legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs. Further
 our capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned if
 for example
 our revenues do not reach expected levels or we have to incur unforeseen capital expenditures and make investments to maintain our competitive position. If this is the case
 we may seek alternative financing
 such as selling additional debt or equity securities
 and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on favorable terms
 if at all. Moreover
 if we issue new debt securities
 the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets
 and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations
 including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities
 existing stockholders may experience dilution
 and such new securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. These factors may make the timing

 and the reputation we enjoy with suppliers
 contract manufacturers
 distributors
 customers and consumers. The loss of the services of any of these employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects
 as we may not be able to find and integrate suitable replacements on a timely basis
 if at all. In addition
 any such departure could be viewed in a negative light by investors and analysts
 which may cause the price of our common stock to decline. 
If our products are alleged to cause injury or illness or fail to comply with governmental regulations
 we may suffer adverse public relations

 including voluntary recalls or withdrawals
 and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to cause injury or illness or if we are alleged to have mislabeled or misbranded our products or otherwise violated governmental regulations. We may also voluntarily recall or withdraw products that we consider below our standards
 whether for taste
 appearance or otherwise
 in order to protect our brand reputation. Consumer or customer concerns (whether justified or not) regarding the safety of our products could adversely affect our business. A product recall or withdrawal could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures
 destruction of product inventory
 and lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time
 which could reduce profitability and cash flow. In addition
 a product recall or withdrawal may require significant management attention. Product recalls
 product liability claims (even if unmerited or unsuccessful)
 or any other events that cause consumers to no longer associate our brands with high quality and safe products may also result in adverse publicity
 hurt the value of our brands
 lead to a decline in consumer confidence in and demand for our products
 and lead to increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies of our operations
 which could have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations. 

 our insurance may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we may incur in connection with product liability claims. For example
 punitive damages are generally not covered by insurance. In addition
 we may not be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance
 obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost
 if at all
 or secure additional coverage (which may result in future product liability claims being uninsured). A product liability judgment against us or our agreement to settle a product liability claim could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures
 which would reduce profitability and cash flow. In addition
 even if product liability claims against us are not successful or are not fully pursued
 these claims could be costly and time-consuming and may require management to spend time defending the claims rather than operating our business. 

 certain actions by a significant customer or financial difficulties of a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations. 
A relatively limited number of customers account for a large percentage of our net sales. During 2017
 ten customers
 who purchase either directly from us or through third-party distributors
 collectively accounted for more than 67% of our net sales. In 2017
 our largest distributor by net sales
 McLane Company
 Inc.
 accounted for 18% of our net sales. These percentages may increase if there is consolidation among retailers or if mass merchandisers grow disproportionately to their competition. We expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers; however
 these customers may not continue to purchase our products in the same quantities as they have in the past. Our customers are not contractually obligated to purchase from us. Changes in our customers&#8217; strategies
 including a reduction in the number of brands they carry
 shipping strategies
 a shift of shelf space to or increased emphasis on private label products (including &#8220;store brands&#8221;)
 a reduction in shelf space for pet food items or a reduction in the space allocated for our Freshpet Fridges may adversely affect our sales. Requirements that may be imposed on us by our customers
 such as sustainability
 inventory management or product specification requirements
 may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally
 especially during economic downturns
 our customers may face financial difficulties
 bankruptcy or other business disruptions that may impact their operations and their purchases from us and may affect their ability to pay us for products purchased from us. Customers may grow their inventory in anticipation of a price increase
 or in anticipation of
 or during
 our promotional events
 which typically provide for reduced prices during a specified time or other customer or consumer incentives. To the extent customers seek to reduce their 


ls or change their practices regarding purchases in excess of consumer consumption
 our sales and results of operations could be adversely impacted in that period. If our sales of products to one or more of our significant customers are reduced
tion could have a material adverse effect on our business
 financial condition and results of operations. 

 in part
 on the sufficiency and effectiveness of our marketing and trade spending programs. 

 due to the highly competitive nature of the businesses in which we compete
 we must execute effective and efficient marketing investments and trade spending programs with respect to our businesses overall to sustain our competitive position in our markets. Marketing investments may be costly. Additionally
 we may
 from time to time
 change our marketing and trade spending strategies
 including the timing
 amount or nature of television advertising and related promotional programs. The sufficiency and effectiveness of our marketing and trade spending practices is important to our ability to retain or improve our market share or margins. If our marketing and trade spending programs are not successful or if we fail to implement sufficient and effective marketing and trade spending programs
 our business
 financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.

 the development and introduction of new products requires substantial research

 these aspects of our operations are regulated by the FDA
 and various state and local public health and agricultural agencies. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 provides direct recall authority to the FDA and includes a number of other provisions designed to enhance food safety
 including increased inspections by the FDA of domestic and foreign food facilities and increased review of food products imported into the United States. In addition
 many states have adopted the Association of American Feed Control Officials&#8217; model pet food regulations or variations thereof
 which generally regulate the information manufacturers provide about pet food. Complying with government regulation can be costly or may otherwise adversely affect our business. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil remedies

 which in turn could reduce our supply of ingredients
 lower recoveries of usable ingredients
 increase the prices of our ingredients
 increase our transportation costs or increase our cost of storing ingredients if harvests are accelerated and processing capacity is unavailable. Additionally
 the growth of crops
 as well as the manufacture and processing of our products
 requires significant amounts of water. Drought or other causes of a reduction of water in aquifers may affect availability of water
 which in turn may adversely affect our results of operations. Competing manufacturers may be affected differently by weather conditions and natural disasters depending on the location of their supplies or operations. If our supply of ingredients is reduced
 we may not be able to find enough supplemental supply sources on favorable terms

 including divisions or subsidiaries of larger companies. We face strong competition from competitors&#8217; products that are sometimes sold at lower prices. Price gaps between our products and our competitors&#8217; products may result in market share erosion and harm our business. A number of our competitors have broader product lines

These competitors may also prove to be more successful in marketing and selling their products or may be better able to increase prices to reflect cost pressures. We may not compete successfully with these other companies or maintain or grow the distribution of our products. We cannot predict the pricing or promotional activities of our competitors or whether they will have a negative effect on us. Many of our competitors engage in aggressive pricing and promotional activities. There are competitive pressures and other factors which could cause our products to lose market share or decline in sales or result in significant price or margin erosion

 our profitability and growth depend significantly on our efforts to control our operating costs. Because many of our costs
 such as energy and logistics costs
 packaging costs and ingredient
 commodity and raw product costs
 are affected by factors outside or substantially outside our control
 we generally must seek to control or reduce costs through operating efficiency or other initiatives. If we are not able to identify and complete initiatives designed to control or reduce costs and increase operating efficiency on time or within budget
 our results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition
 if the cost savings initiatives we have implemented to date
 or any future cost-savings initiatives
 do not generate expected cost savings
 our business

 commodities and ingredients that we require are subject to price increases and shortages that could adversely affect our results of operations. 

 commodities and ingredients that we use include meat
 vegetables
 fruits
 carrageenans
 whole grains
 vitamins
 minerals
 packaging and energy (including wind power). Prices for these and other items we use may be volatile
 and we may experience shortages in these items due to factors beyond our control
 such as commodity market fluctuations
 availability of supply
 increased demand (whether for the item we require or for other items
 which in turn impacts the item we require)
 weather conditions
 natural disasters
 currency fluctuations
 governmental regulations (including import restrictions)
 agricultural programs or issues
 energy programs
 labor strikes and the financial health of our suppliers. Input
 commodity and ingredient price increases or shortages may result in higher costs or interrupt our production schedules
 each of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Production delays could lead to reduced sales volumes and profitability
 as well as loss of market share. Higher costs could adversely impact our earnings. For example
 fuel prices affect our transportation costs for both ingredients and finished product. If we are not able to implement our productivity initiatives or increase our product prices to offset price increases of our inputs
 commodities and ingredients
 as a result of consumer sensitivity to pricing or otherwise
 or if sales volumes decline due to price increases
 our results of operations could be adversely affected. Our competitors may be better able than we are to implement productivity initiatives or effect price increases or to otherwise pass along cost increases to their customers. Moreover
 if we increase our prices in response to increased costs
 we may need to increase marketing spending
 including trade promotion spending
 in order to retain our market share. Such increased marketing spending may significantly offset the benefits

 the cost of alternative sources of the protein-based ingredients we use in our products has from time to time increased significantly and may increase again in the future if additional cases of mad cow disease are found. 

 such as foot-and-mouth disease or highly pathogenic avian influenza
 also known as &#8220;bird flu
&#8221; impacts the availability of the protein-based ingredients we use in our products
 we may be required to locate alternative sources for protein-based ingredients. Those sources may not be available to sustain our sales volumes
 may be more costly and may affect the quality and nutritional value of our products. If outbreaks of mad cow disease
 foot-and-mouth disease
 bird flu or any other animal disease or the regulation or publicity resulting therefrom impacts the cost of the protein-based ingredients we use in our products
 or the cost of the alternative protein-based ingredients necessary for our products as compared to our current costs
 we may be required to increase the selling price of our products to avoid margin deterioration. However
 we may not be able to charge higher prices for our products without negatively impacting future sales volumes. 


 from time to time
 a co-packer may experience financial difficulties
 bankruptcy or other business disruptions
 which could disrupt our supply of finished goods or require that we incur additional expense by providing financial accommodations to the co-packer or taking other steps to seek to minimize or avoid supply disruption
 such as establishing a new co-packing arrangement with another provider. During an economic downturn
 our co-packers may be more susceptible to experiencing such financial difficulties
 bankruptcies or other business disruptions. A new co-packing arrangement may not be available on terms as favorable to us as the existing co-packing arrangement
 if at all.

 as well as having too much inventory on hand that may reach its expiration date and become unsaleable. Changes in the availability and cost of freight may affect our supply chain and ultimately the pricing and availability of our products. If we are unable to manage our supply chain effectively and ensure that our products are available to meet consumer demand
 our operating costs could increase and our profit margins could decrease. 


 shipment tracking and freight dispatch services. Our use of transportation services for shipments is subject to risks
 including increases in fuel prices
 which would increase our shipping costs
 and employee strikes and inclement weather
 which may impact the ability of providers to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs
 including keeping our products adequately refrigerated during shipment. Any such change could cause us to incur costs and expend resources. Moreover
 in the future we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those we receive from the third-party transportation providers that we currently use
 which in turn would increase our costs and thereby adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. 


If we are unable to maintain or increase prices for our products

 including competition
 our competitors&#8217; pricing and marketing
 aggregate industry supply
 category limitations
 market demand and economic conditions
 including inflationary pressures. During challenging economic times
 our ability to increase the prices of our products may be particularly constrained. Additionally
 customers may pressure us to rescind price increases that we have announced or already implemented (either through a change in list price or increased promotional activity). If we are unable to maintain or increase prices for our products (or must increase promotional activity)
 our results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore
 price increases generally result in volume losses
 as consumers purchase fewer units. If such losses (also referred to as the elasticity impact) are greater than expected or if we lose distribution due to a price increase (which may result from a customer response or otherwise)
 our business
 financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 


 we recently expanded our business to two retailers in the United Kingdom
 where our products are selling in 370 stores.&nbsp;&nbsp;As we expand our business into new countries we may encounter regulatory

 train and retain employees
 we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business. 

 train and retain a sufficient number of employees who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to represent our brand effectively and establish credibility with our business partners and consumers. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of meeting our business needs and expectations
 our business and brand image may be impaired. Any failure to meet our staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates of our employees may adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. 


 our employees may elect to be represented by labor unions in the future. If a significant number of our employees were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements
 it could adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations. In addition
 a labor dispute involving some or all of our employees may harm our reputation
 disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues
 and resolution of disputes may increase our costs. 

 we may be subject to various employment-related claims
 such as individual or class actions or government enforcement actions relating to alleged employment discrimination
 employee classification and related withholding
 wage-hour
 labor standards or healthcare and benefit issues. Such actions
 if brought against us and successful in whole or in part
 may affect our ability to compete or could materially adversely affect our business

 customer and consumer demand for our products. In addition
 our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our suppliers
 contract manufacturers
 distributors
 customers
 consumers and creditors may suffer. Consumers have access to lower-priced offerings and
 during economic downturns
 may shift purchases to these lower-priced or other perceived value offerings. Customers may become more conservative in response to these conditions and seek to reduce their inventories. For example
 during the economic downturn from 2007 through 2009
 customers significantly reduced their inventories. Our results of operations depend upon
 among other things
 our ability to maintain and increase sales volume with our existing customers
 to attract new consumers and to provide products that appeal to consumers at prices they are willing and able to pay. Prolonged unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability. 


We are subject to environmental regulation and environmental risks
 which may adversely affect our business. Climate change or concerns regarding climate change may increase environmental regulation and environmental risks. 

 we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent and compliance with them is becoming increasingly expensive. Changes in environmental conditions may result in existing legislation having a greater impact on us. Additionally
 we may be subject to new legislation and regulation in the future. For example
 increasing concern about climate change may result in additional federal and state legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of green-house gas emissions. Compliance with environmental legislation and regulations
 particularly if they are more aggressive than our current sustainability measures used to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency
 may increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations. We cannot predict the extent to which any environmental law or regulation that may be enacted or enforced in the future may affect our operations. The effect of these actions and future actions on the availability and use of pesticides could adversely impact our financial position or results of operations. If the cost of compliance with applicable environmental laws or regulations increases
 our business
 financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.

 or others who have entrusted us with information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs
 including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies

 and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities
 new technological discoveries or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. In addition
 data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues
 including breach by us or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. Any compromise or breach of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws
 significant legal and financial exposure
 and a loss of confidence in our security measures
 which could have an adverse effect on our business

If we are unable to substantially utilize our net operating loss carryforward
 our financial results will be adversely affected. 

 2017
 we had federal net operating loss (&#8220;NOLs&#8221;) carryforwards of approximately $175.0 and state NOLs of approximately $143.4 million. In general
 a corporation that undergoes an &#8216;&#8216;ownership change&#8217;&#8217; is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its prechange NOLs to offset future taxable income. In general
 under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986
 as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;)
 an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% stockholders
 applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders&#8217; lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). Purchases of our common stock in amounts greater than specified levels
 which will be beyond our control
 could create a limitation on our ability to utilize our NOLs for tax purposes in the future. Limitations imposed on our ability to utilize NOLs could cause U.S. federal and state income taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expire unused
 in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Furthermore
 we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our NOLs before they expire. If any of these events occur
 we may not derive some or all of the expected benefits from our NOLs. In addition
 NOLs incurred in one state may not be available to offset income earned in a different state. Furthermore
 there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited for state tax purposes
 which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. 


 we are required to comply with the SEC&#8217;s rules implementing Section&#160;302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

 and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the purchase price. Those fluctuations could be based on various factors in addition to those otherwise described in this report
 including those described under &#8220;&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business and Industry&#8221; and the following: 

















the public&#8217;s reaction to our press releases
 our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC; 

















global

 legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance; 

















future sales of our common stock by our officers
 directors and significant stockholders; 

















other developments affecting us
 our industry or our competitors. 

 in recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause declines in the market price of our common stock. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business
 financial condition and results of operations
 and those fluctuations could materially reduce our common stock price. 

 we are especially vulnerable to these factors to the extent that they affect our industry or our products. In the past
 securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price and we are currently defending against the claims made in Curran v. Freshpet
 Inc. et al. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management&#8217;s attention and resources
 and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation.

548 shares of common stock outstanding
 and our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 200 million shares of common stock. 

 we may issue additional shares of common stock or other securities if we need to raise additional capital. The number of new shares of our common stock issued in connection with raising additional capital could constitute a material portion of the then outstanding shares of our common stock. Any future sales of our common stock
 or the perception that such sales may occur
 could negatively impact the price of our common stock. 

 our stock price and trading volume could decline. 

 our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly
 demand for our common stock could decrease
 which could cause our stock prices and trading volume to decline. 


Our principal stockholder and its affiliates own a substantial portion of our outstanding equity
 and their interests may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders. 

 2017
 MidOcean Partners and certain of its affiliates (&#8220;MidOcean&#8221;) owned approximately 20.8% of our common stock. As a result
 MidOcean could potentially have significant influence over all matters presented to our stockholders for approval
 including election and removal of our directors
 change in control transactions and the outcome of all actions requiring a majority stockholder approval.

 a member who currently serves on our Board of Directors is associated with MidOcean. The interests of MidOcean may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock
 and the concentration of control in MidOcean will limit other stockholders&#8217; ability to influence corporate matters. The concentration of ownership and voting power of MidOcean may also delay
 defer or even prevent an acquisition by a third-party or other change of control of our Company and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without their support
 even if such events are in the best interests of our other stockholders. Therefore
 the concentration of voting power that MidOcean has may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. We may also take actions that our other stockholders do not view as beneficial
 which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and cause the value of your investment to decline.

 you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it. 

 even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders
 and could make it more difficult for you to change our management. 

 we have a classified Board of Directors with three-year staggered terms

 may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 

 we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making offerings of debt securities or additional offerings of equity securities. Upon bankruptcy or liquidation
 holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock

 and may result in future Section&#160;382 limitations that could reduce the rate at which we utilize our NOL carryforwards. Preferred stock
 if issued
 could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments or both that could limit our ability to make a dividend distribution to the holders of our common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control. As a result
 we cannot predict or estimate the amount
 timing or nature of our future offerings
 and purchasers of our common stock in this offering bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their ownership interest in our company.

 we amended our Credit Facilities to replace our Term Facility (as defined below) and Capex Commitments (as defined below) of $30.0 million and $10.0 million Revolving Facility with a straight $30.0 million revolver (the &#8220;New Revolving Facility&#8221;) and the ability to increase the New Revolving Facility by an additional $10.0 million.

 plus an applicable margin. Subject to the Company&#8217;s leverage ratio
 the applicable margin will vary between 0.75% and 1.25% for base rate loans and 1.75% and 2.25% for LIBOR loans. The amendment resulted in a reduction in the unused rate of between 25 and 75 basis points and a reduction in the total rate of between 200 and 250 basis points. At closing
 we had total borrowings of $5.5 million under the $30.0 million New Revolving Facility
 with $24.5 million available. All borrowings were fully repaid by December 31
 2017.

 our SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to 48.1% in 2017. We believe that as we begin to realize the benefits of our Feed the Growth initiative
 SG&amp;A expenses will once again decrease as a percentage of net sales.

Prior to the second quarter of 2016
 outbound freight from our Freshpet Kitchens was managed by a national third-party refrigerated and frozen human food manufacturer. During the second quarter of 2016
 we transitioned to a new third-party logistics provider. Through our new third-party logistics provider&#8217;s infrastructure
 we continue to realize cost efficiencies in logistics.
Our marketing and advertising expenses primarily consist of national television media
 digital marketing
 social media and grass roots marketing to drive brand awareness. These expenses may vary from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our marketing and advertising campaigns. Our Feed the Growth initiative will focus on growing the business through increased marketing investments.



. We account for all share-based compensation payments issued to employees
 directors and non-employees using a fair value method. Accordingly
 share-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date. We recognize compensation expense for the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the period during which the recipient renders the required services to us using the straight-line single option method.

 2017
 we had approximately $143.4 million of state NOLs
 which expire between 2017 and 2037. At December&#160;31
 2017
 we had a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets as the realization of such assets was not considered more likely than not.

 income tax expense
 and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus loss on disposal of equipment

 leadership transition costs and litigation expense.
We believe that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional metrics to evaluate our operations and
 when considered with both our U.S. GAAP results and the reconciliation to the closest comparable U.S. GAAP measures
 provide a more complete understanding of our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. We use the non-GAAP financial measures
 together with U.S GAAP financial measures
 such as net sales
 gross profit margins and cash 


flow from operations
 to assess our historical and prospective operating performance
ds
 to enhance our understanding of our operating performance and to compare our performance to that of our peers and competitors.


 and other items as detailed below. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net loss
 income from operations or any other measure of financial performance calculated and prescribed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA should be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures in other organizations because other organizations may not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner as we do.

 the non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect:

















the interest expense (including Fees on debt guarantee which we believe were at cost of our prior financing agreement akin to interest expense)
 or the cash requirements necessary to service interest expense or principal payments
 associated with indebtedness;








depreciation and amortization
 which are non-cash charges
 although the assets being depreciated and amortized will likely have to be replaced in the future
 nor any cash requirements for such replacements; and










 Adjusted EBITDA excludes (i) non-cash share-based compensation expense
 which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package
 and (ii) certain costs essential to our sales growth and strategy
 including an allowance for marketing expenses for each new store added to our network and non-capitalizable freight costs associated with Freshpet Fridge replacements. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations. Other companies in our industry may calculate the non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do
 limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

 we expect to rely on our current and future cash flow from operations
 and our current available borrowing capacity. Our ability to obtain additional funding will be subject to various factors
 including general market conditions
 our operating performance
 the market&#8217;s perception of our growth potential
 lender sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with other contractual restrictions
 such as financial covenants under our debt agreements.
Additionally
 our ability to make payments on
 and to refinance
 any indebtedness under our Credit Facilities and to fund any necessary expenditures for our growth will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. If our business does not achieve the levels of profitability or generate the amount of cash that we anticipate or if we expand faster than anticipated
 we may need to seek additional debt or equity financing to operate and expand our business. Future third-party financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all.

 expected cash flow from operations and planned borrowing capacity are adequate to fund debt service requirements
 operating lease obligations
 capital expenditures and working capital obligations for the foreseeable future. However
 our ability to continue to meet these requirements and obligations will depend on
 among other things
 our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenue and cash flow from operations and our ability to manage costs and working capital successfully. Additionally
 our cash flow generation ability is subject to general economic
 financial
 competitive
 legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs. Further
 our capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned if
 for example
 our revenues do not reach expected levels or we have to incur unforeseen capital expenditures and make investments to maintain our competitive position. If this is the case
 we may seek alternative financing
 such as selling additional debt or equity securities
 and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on favorable terms
 if at all. Moreover
 if we issue new debt securities
 the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets
 and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations
 including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities
 existing stockholders may experience dilution
 and such new securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. These factors may make the timing
 amount
 terms and conditions of additional financings unattractive. Our inability to raise capital could impede our growth or otherwise require us to forego growth opportunities and could materially adversely affect our business
 financial condition and results of operations.
Working capital increased $9.7 million to $10.3 million at December 31
 2017 compared with $0.6 million at December 31
 2016. The increase was a result of increased accounts receivable inventory
 and a decrease in borrowing offset by an increase in accounts payable
 accrued expenses
 and a decrease in cash.

As of December 31
 2017
 our capital resources consisted primarily of $2.2 million cash on hand and $30.0 million available under our Credit Facilities. In the third quarter of 2017
 we amended our Credit Facilities
 to replace our Term Facility and Capex Commitments of $30.0 million and $10.0 million Revolving Facility (the New Revolving Facility) and the ability to increase the New Revolving Facility by an additional $10.0 million. The New Revolving Facility will mature in September 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment resulted in a reduction in the unused rate of between 25 and 75 basis points and a reduction in the total rate of between 200 and 250 basis points. The existing facility
 which had $7.5 million outstanding
 was repaid with proceeds from the New Revolving Facility and cash on hand.

 2017
 net cash provided by operating activities was $10.3 million
 consisting of net income
 adjusted for reconciling non-cash items
 of $14.0 million and an increase in operating assets and liabilities of $3.7 million. Net income
 adjusted for reconciling non-cash items
 excludes $18.3 million of non-cash items primarily relating to $4.4 million of share-based compensation and $12.7 million of depreciation and amortization. The increase in assets of $9.7 million is primarily related to growth in accounts receivable and inventory. The growth in accounts receivable is primarily due to growth in net sales. The increase in inventory is a result of timing of sales in December year-over-year as well as manufacturing of certain new items towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 that will reach retailers in January and February of 2018. The increase in liabilities of $6.0 million was due to timing of payments
 including $2.1 million related to accrued compensation.

 net cash provided by operating activities was $12.8 million
 primarily consisting of net income adjusted for non-cash items of $11.2 million
 which excludes $14.3 million of non-cash items primarily relating to $4.2 million of share-based compensation and $9.9 million of depreciation and amortization
 and proceeds from an increase in operating assets and liabilities of $1.6 million. The increase in assets of $1.5 million is primarily related to growth in accounts receivable
 which is primarily due to growth in net sales and an increase in the number of stores with a Freshpet fridge. The increase in liabilities of $3.1 million was due to timing of payments and accrued leadership transition costs.

 net cash provided by operating activities was $6.7 million
 which consisted of net income
 adjusted for non-cash items
 of $3.7 million
 and a $0.7 million decrease related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. The change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable of $1.7 and a decrease in accrued expenses of $0.7 million
 offset by a decrease in inventories of $0.6 million
 decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1.1 million
 and an increase in accounts payable of $0.2 million. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to growth in net sales. The change in remaining operating accounts is due to timing.


 2017 relates primarily to capital expenditures related to the Freshpet Kitchens of $3.3 million and investments in fridges as well as other miscellaneous capital spend of $9.7 million.

 2016 relates primarily to capital expenditures related to the Freshpet Kitchens of $20.8 million (including the Freshpet Kitchens expansion of $17.6 million and recurring capital expenditures of $3.2 million)
 investments in fridges
 as well as other miscellaneous capital spend of $9.1 million
 offset by maturities of short-term investments of $3.2 million.

 2015 relates primarily to capital expenditures related to the Freshpet Kitchens of $19.1 million (including the Freshpet Kitchens expansion of $17.6 million and recurring capital expenditures of $1.5 million)

 2014
 the Company entered into senior secured credit facilities (the &#8220;Debt Refinancing&#8221;) comprised of a 5-year $18.0 million term facility (the &#8220;Term Facility&#8221;)
 a 3-year $10.0 million revolving facility (the &#8220;Revolving Facility&#8221;) and a $12.0 million additional term loan commitment earmarked primarily for capital expenditures (the &#8220;Capex Commitments&#8221; and together with the Term Facility and Revolving Facility
 the &#8220;Credit Facilities&#8221; and such loan agreement
 the &#8220;Loan Agreement&#8221;). 

 2014
 the Company modified the terms of the $40.0 million Credit Facilities. The $18.0 million Term Facility was repaid and extinguished
 the 3-year $10.0 million Revolving Facility remained unchanged
 and the $12.0 million Capex Commitments was increased to $30.0 million. Amounts borrowed under the Capex Commitments reduce the $30.0 million available such that the borrowed funds are no longer available after repayment. Any drawn Capex Commitments will mature on the fifth anniversary of the execution of the Loan Agreement
 and undrawn Capex Commitments will expire on the third anniversary of the execution of the Loan Agreement. Under the terms of the Loan Agreement
 the commitments for the $10.0 million Revolving Facility may be increased up to $20.0 million subject to certain conditions. 

 2017
 the Company further amended the Loan Agreement (the &#8220;New Loan Agreement&#8221;) which modified the $10.0 million Revolving Facility to $30.0 million and extinguished the $30.0 million Capex Commitments. The New Loan Agreement has a term of three years and the ability to increase the New Revolving Facility by $10.0 million
 with borrowings bearing interest at variable rates.

 which was repaid with proceeds from the New Revolving Facility and cash on hand. Upon closing
 the Company had $5.5 million outstanding and $24.5 million available under the New Revolving Facility.


 the Company accelerated the amortization of $0.3 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the existing Loan Agreement. These costs are included in Interest Expense in the twelve months ended December 31
 2017.

The New Loan Agreement provides for the maintenance of various covenants
 including financial covenants
 and includes events of default that are customary for facilities of this type. During the year ended December 31
 2017
 the Company borrowed $7.5 million under our Credit Facilities


 2017. Interest expense and fees totaled $0.5 million
 $0.7 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31
 2017
 2016 and 2015
 respectively. There was less than $0.1 million of accrued interest on the Credit Facilities as of December 31
 2017 and 2016.

 which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
 or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 as well as the revenue and expenses incurred during the reported periods. On an ongoing basis
 we evaluate our estimates and judgments
 including those related to accrued expenses and share-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances

Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

 as these policies related to the more significant areas involving management&#8217;s judgments and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results

 2017
 we had federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $175.0 million
 which expire at various dates between 2025 and 2037. We may be subject to the NOL utilization provisions of Section&#160;382 of the Code. The effect of an ownership change would be the imposition of an annual limitation on the use of NOL carryforwards attributable to periods before the change. The amount of the annual limitation depends upon our value immediately before the ownership change
 changes to our capital during a specified period prior to the change and the federal published interest rate. Although we have not completed a Code Section&#160;382 analysis
 if we were to undergo an ownership change it is likely that the utilization of the NOLs will be substantially limited.

 the deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December&#160;31
 2017 and 2016
 we determined that a valuation allowance of 100% is deemed appropriate.


&#8212;Revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon shipment or delivery to our customers
eterminable. This completes the revenue-earning process specifically that an arrangement exists

 consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances and merchandising funds and from time-to-time
 consumer coupons are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of estimated trade incentive spending
 which is recognized as incurred at the time of sale. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are included as accrued expense in the consolidated balance sheet. Coupon redemption costs are also recognized as reduction to calculate net sales when the coupons are issued. Estimates of trade promotion expense and coupon redemption costs are based upon programs offered
 timing of those offers
 estimated redemption/usage rates from historical performance
 management&#8217;s experience and current economic trends.
We account for all share-based compensation payments issued to employees
 directors and nonemployees using a fair value method. Accordingly
 share-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the period during which the recipient renders the required services to us using the straight-line single option method.


 we reassess the probability of achieving the performance criteria and the performance period required to meet those targets. Determining whether the performance criteria will be achieved involves judgment
 and the estimate of share-based compensation expense may be revised periodically based on changes in the probability of achieving the performance criteria. Revisions are reflected in the period in which the estimate is changed. If performance goals are not met
 no share-based compensation expense is recognized for the cancelled shares
 and
 to the extent share-based compensation expense was previously recognized for those cancelled shares
 such share-based compensation expense is reversed.


 the Financial Accounting Standard Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued ASU No. 2014-09
 &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers
&#8221; which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In connection with this ASU
 the FASB also issued ASU No. 2016-10 regarding identification of performance obligations and licensing considerations
 ASU No. 2016-12 regarding narrow scope improvements and practical expedients- and ASU No. 2016-08 which clarifies the implementation of guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In August 2015
 the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 to fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017
 with early adoption permitted only for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2016. Topic 606 permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method)
 or modified retrospectively with the cumulative effect of applying the guidance as of the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). 

In February 2016
 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases
&#8221; which requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is assessing the impact of ASU No. 2016-02 on its corporate office lease
 and upon adoption of this guidance
 expects to record the lease on its consolidated balance sheet in accordance with ASU No. 2016-02.

 the Company considers all relevant positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The realization of the gross deferred tax assets is dependent on several factors

The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the Company&#8217;s deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The Company has experienced taxable losses from inception. As such

 tax years subject to potential tax examination could apply from that date because the utilization of net operating losses from prior years opens the relevant year to audit by the IRS and/or state taxing authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest and penalties
 if any
 as they relate to income taxes assessed
 are included in the income tax provision. The Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits and has not accrued any interest or penalties through 2017.

 2017
 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;2017 Tax Act&#8221;) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include
 but are not limited to
 a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 34% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31
 2017
 which will result in a reduction of approximately $18.9 million for the deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and other assets
 the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system
 and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. The 2017 Tax Act had no impact on tax expense primarily due to us maintaining a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets.


 2017
 the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available
 prepared
 or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act. We did not identify items with the exception of Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) noted below for which the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act have not been completed and could not be reasonably estimated as of December 31
 2017
 and as such
 our financial results reflect the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC Topic 740 is complete.

&#8212;In December 2006
 the Company approved the 2006 Stock Plan (the &#8220;2006 Plan&#8221;) under which options to purchase approximately 624
223 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock were granted to employees and affiliates of the Company. These options are time-based (vest over five years). Certain option awards provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control (as defined in the 2006 Plan). At December&#160;31
 2017
 there were zero shares available for grant as the plan is frozen. 
&#8212;In December 2010
 the Company approved the 2010 Stock Plan (the &#8220;2010 Plan&#8221;) under which options to purchase approximately 2
146
shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock were granted to employees and affiliates of the Company (in 2012
 the 2010 Plan was amended to allow for option to purchase approximately 2
220
280 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock). These options are either time-based (vest over four years)
 performance-based (vest when performance targets are met
 as defined in the stock option grant agreement)
 or vest at the occurrence of an exit event which is defined as a Change of Control in the Company or an initial public offering registered under the Securities Act
 as defined in the stock grant agreement. 

 the Company modified 419
366 of its performance-based awards to time-based awards that vest over two years. At the time of the December 2016 modification the performance-based awards&#8217; vesting criteria was not considered probable. All modified awards were fair valued on the modification date. As of December 31
 2016
 the vesting of any remaining performance-based awards which were not modified in December 2016 is not considered probable of vesting and accordingly the Company has not recognized the related compensation expense.

&#8212;In November 2014
 the Company approved the 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the &#8220;2014 Plan&#8221;) under which 1
479
200 shares of common stock may be issued or used for reference purposes as awards granted under the 2014 Plan. In September 2016
 the 2014 Plan was amended to allow for the granting of an additional 2

 for a total of 3
979
200 shares. These awards may be in the form of stock options
 stock appreciation rights
 restricted stock
 as well as other share-based and cash-based awards. As of December 31
 2017
 the awards granted were either time-based (cliff vest over three years)
 performance-based (vest when performance targets are met

For the grants during the year ended December&#160;31

 the expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of the Company&#8217;s common stock. 

 we no longer deemed it appropriate to use historical volatility as it was not representative of the Company&#8217;s stock on the public market.&nbsp;&nbsp;As such expected volatility that was utilized was based upon the volatility of a group of similar entities
 referred to as &#8220;guideline&#8221; companies. As Freshpet has more historical data based on more time as a public company
 the historical volatility of Freshpet becomes a more significant input.

 that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company&#8217;s management
 including its principal executive and principal financial officers
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

 with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
 evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December&#160;31
 2017. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December&#160;31
 2017
 our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
 as of such date
 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

 using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992). This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on this assessment
 management concluded that as of December 31

 the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting was effective.


 2017 that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.


 including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
 believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However
 our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system
 no matter how well conceived and operated
 can provide only reasonable
 not absolute
 assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further
 the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
 and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems
 no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud
 if any
 have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty
 and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally
 controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons
 by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
 and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time
 controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
 or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system
 misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 Inc. (hereafter referred to as &amp;#8220;Freshpet&amp;#8221; or the &amp;#8220;Company&amp;#8221;)
 a Delaware corporation
 manufactures and markets natural fresh
 refrigerated meals and treats for dogs and cats. The Company&amp;#8217;s products are distributed throughout the United States and other international markets into major retail classes including Grocery and Mass (which includes club)
 and Online
 as well as Pet Specialty
 and Natural retail. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Basis of Presentation &lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt;&amp;#8211;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt;The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (&amp;#8220;U.S. GAAP&amp;#8221;).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Principles of Consolidation&lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt; &amp;#8211; The financial statements include the accounts of the Company as well as the Company&amp;#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Segments&lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt; &amp;#8211; The Company operates as a single operating segment reporting to its chief operating decision maker. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Estimates and Uncertainties&lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt; &amp;#8211; The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
 as determined at a later date
 could differ from those estimates. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Cash and Cash Equivalents&lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt; &amp;#8211; The Company at times considers money market funds and all other highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold;;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-top:2pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Short-Term Investments &lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt;&amp;#8211;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt;The Company at times holds interest-bearing certificates of deposits with financial institutions with maturities ranging from three months to one year. Certificates of deposit are classified as short-term investments and interest is recorded as other expenses
 net. Historically
 interest income has not been material. The Company will continue to monitor interest income and will disclose separately if significant. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Accounts Receivable&lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt; &amp;#8211; The Company records trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts. On a periodic basis
 the Company evaluates its accounts receivable and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its history of write-offs and collections and current credit conditions. Accounts receivable are written off when management deems them to be uncollectible. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Inventories&lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt; &amp;#8211; Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market
 using the first-in
 first-out method. When necessary
 the Company provides allowances to adjust the carrying value of its inventories to the lower of cost or net realizable value
 including any costs to sell or dispose and consideration for obsolescence
 excessive inventory levels
 product deterioration and other factors in evaluating net realizable value. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Property
 Plant and Equipment&lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt; &amp;#8211; Property
 plant and equipment are recorded at cost. The Company provides for depreciation on the straight-line method by charges to income at rates based upon estimated recovery periods of 7 years for furniture and office equipment
 5 years for automotive equipment
 9 years for refrigeration equipment
 5 to 10 years for machinery and equipment
 and 15 to 39 years for building and improvements. Capitalized cost includes the costs incurred to bring the property
 plant and equipment to the condition and location necessary for its intended use
 which includes any necessary delivery
 electrical and installation cost for equipment. Maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful life of the assets over two years are charged to expense as incurred. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful lives on the straight-line method. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Long-Lived Assets&lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt; &amp;#8211; The Company evaluates all long-lived assets for impairment. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future net cash flows
 an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to their fair value less estimated costs to sell. Estimating future cash flows and calculating fair value of assets requires significant estimates and assumptions by management. If the carrying amount is not fully recoverable
 an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carry amount to fair value
 and is charged to expense in the period of impairment. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Income Taxes &lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt;&amp;#8211; The Company provides for deferred income taxes for temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting
 principally net operating loss carryforwards
 depreciation
 and share-based compensation. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;A valuation allowance is appropriate when management believes it is more likely than not
 the deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December&amp;#160;31
 2017
 and 2016
 the Company determined that a valuation allowance of 100% is appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Revenue Recognition and Incentives &lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt;&amp;#8211; Revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment to the customers as terms are free on board (&amp;#8220;FOB&amp;#8221;) shipping point
 at which point title and risk of loss is transferred and the selling price is fixed or determinable. This completes the revenue-earning process specifically that an arrangement exists
 delivery has occurred
 ownership has transferred
 the price is fixed and collectability is reasonably assured. A provision for payment discounts and product return allowances
 which is estimated based upon the Company&amp;#8217;s historical performance
 management&amp;#8217;s experience and current economic trends
 is recorded as a reduction of sales in the same period that the revenue is recognized. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Trade incentives
 consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances and merchandising funds
 and consumer coupons are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of estimated trade incentive spending
 which is recognized as incurred at the time of sale. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are included as accrued expense in the consolidated balance sheet. Coupon redemption costs are also recognized as reductions of net sales when the coupons are issued. Estimates of trade promotion expense and coupon redemption costs are based upon programs offered
 timing of those offers
 estimated redemption/usage rates from historical performance
 management&amp;#8217;s experience and current economic trends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Advertising&lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt; &amp;#8211; Advertising costs are expensed when incurred

 general
 and administrative expenses within the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Shipping and handling costs primarily consist of costs associated with moving finished products to customers
 including costs associated with our distribution center and the cost of shipping products to customers through third-party carriers. Shipping and handling cost totaled $12

Share-based compensation expense recognized in the statement of operations included compensation expense for share-based payment awards granted subsequent to December 31
 2006
 based on the grant date fair value estimated. Share awards are amortized under the straight-line method over the requisite service period of the entire award. Upon the adoption of ASU 2016-09
 the Company no longer estimates expected forfeitures but accounts for forfeitures as they occur.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;The Company determines the fair value of the stock options granted as either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued
 whichever is more reliably measurable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;Fair Value of Financial Instruments&lt;font style=font-weight:normal;&gt; &amp;#8211; Financial Accounting Standards Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) guidance specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources
 while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-top:6pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;In May 2014
 the Financial Accounting Standard Board (&amp;#8220;FASB&amp;#8221;) issued ASU No. 2014-09
 &amp;#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers
&amp;#8221; which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In connection with this ASU
 the FASB also issued ASU No. 2016-10 regarding identification of performance obligations and licensing considerations
 ASU No. 2016-12 regarding narrow scope improvements and practical expedients- and ASU No. 2016-08 which clarifies the implementation of guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In August 2015
 the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 to fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2017
 with early adoption permitted only for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2016. Topic 606 permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method)
 or modified retrospectively with the cumulative effect of applying the guidance as of the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=text-align:justify;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;&gt;The Company will adopt Topic 606 in the first quarter of 2018 using the full retrospective method approach requiring the company to adopt Topic 606 to each prior reporting period presented. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements and is limited to classification differences within the statement of operating income from cost of goods sold to a reduction to net sales. The net effect will decrease net sales for 2017 by approximately 2.6% lower than under the previous accounting standard. The new accounting standard will not impact Net Income.&lt;/p&gt;

 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02

&#8221; which requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15
 2018
 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.

 the Company considers all relevant positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The realization of the gross deferred tax assets is dependent on several factors
 including the generation of sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the Company&#8217;s deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The Company has experienced taxable losses from inception. As such
 there is a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets as of December&#160;31

The amount of the annual limitation depends upon the value of the Company immediately before the change

 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;2017 Tax Act&#8221;) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include
 but are not limited to
 a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 34% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31
 2017
 which will result in a reduction of approximately $18.9 million for the deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and other assets
 the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system
 and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. The 2017 Tax Act had no impact on tax expense primarily due to us maintaining a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets.


 2017
 the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available
 prepared
 or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act.

660 and $52
566 respectively.

&#8212;In December 2006
 the Company approved the 2006 Stock Plan (the &#8220;2006 Plan&#8221;) under which options to purchase approximately 624
223 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock were granted to employees and affiliates of the Company. These options are time-based (vest over five years). Certain option awards provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control (as defined in the 2006 Plan). At December&#160;31
 2017
 there were zero shares available for grant as the plan is frozen. 
&#8212;In December 2010
 the Company approved the 2010 Stock Plan (the &#8220;2010 Plan&#8221;) under which options to purchase approximately 2
146
shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock were granted to employees and affiliates of the Company (in 2012
 the 2010 Plan was amended to allow for option to purchase approximately 2
220
280 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock). These options are either time-based (vest over four years)
 performance-based (vest when performance targets are met
 as defined in the stock option grant agreement)
 or vest at the occurrence of an exit event which is defined as a Change of Control in the Company or an initial public offering registered under the Securities Act
 as defined in the stock grant agreement. 

 the Company modified 419
366 of its performance-based awards to time-based awards that vest over two years. At the time of the December 2016 modification the performance-based awards&#8217; vesting criteria was not considered probable. All modified awards were fair valued on the modification date. As of December 31
 2016
 the vesting of any remaining performance-based awards which were not modified in December 2016 is not considered probable of vesting and accordingly the Company has not recognized the related compensation expense.

&#8212;In November 2014
 the Company approved the 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the &#8220;2014 Plan&#8221;) under which 1
479
200 shares of common stock may be issued or used for reference purposes as awards granted under the 2014 Plan. In September 2016
 the 2014 Plan was amended to allow for the granting of an additional 2
500
000 shares of common stock to be issued or used for reference purposes as awards granted
 for a total of 3
979
200 shares. These awards may be in the form of stock options
 stock appreciation rights
 restricted stock
 as well as other share-based and cash-based awards. As of December 31
 2017
 the awards granted were either time-based (cliff vest over three years)
 performance-based (vest when performance targets are met
 as defined in the stock option grant agreement)
 or restricted stock units (employee RSUs cliff vest over three years and non-employee director RSUs cliff vest over one year).

 2017
 there were 2
173
343 shares of common stock available to be issued or used for reference purposes under the 2014 Plan. 
&#8212;During the year ended December 31
 2016
 500
000 service period stock options and 500
000 performance-based stock options were granted to the Company&#8217;s CEO as an inducement under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. Under the terms of the agreement
 the grant is governed as if issued under the 2014 Omnibus Plan. As of December 31
 2016
 the awards granted were time-based (cliff vest over four years) and performance-based (vest when performance targets are met

 respectively. 
For the grants during the year ended December&#160;31
 2013
 the expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of the Company&#8217;s common stock. 

 we no longer deemed it appropriate to use historical volatility as it was not representative of the Company&#8217;s stock on the public market.&nbsp;&nbsp;As such expected volatility that was utilized was based upon the volatility of a group of similar entities
 referred to as &#8220;guideline&#8221; companies. As Freshpet has more historical data based on more time as a public company
 the historical volatility of Freshpet becomes a more significant input.
&#8212;The Company determined the expected term based on the &#8220;shortcut method&#8221; described in FASB ASC 718
 Compensation&#8212;

&#8212;The Company has not historically declared dividends
 and no future dividends are expected to be available to benefit option holders. Accordingly
 the Company used an expected dividend yield of zero in the valuation model.

 &#8211; Freshpet
 Inc. (hereafter referred to as &#8220;Freshpet&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;)
 a Delaware corporation
 manufactures and markets natural fresh
 refrigerated meals and treats for dogs and cats. The Company&#8217;s products are distributed throughout the United States and other international markets into major retail classes including Grocery and Mass (which includes club)
 and Online
 as well as Pet Specialty
 and Natural retail. 























 &#8211; The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
 as determined at a later date
 could differ from those estimates. 











The Company at times holds interest-bearing certificates of deposits with financial institutions with maturities ranging from three months to one year. Certificates of deposit are classified as short-term investments and interest is recorded as other expenses
 net. Historically
 interest income has not been material. The Company will continue to monitor interest income and will disclose separately if significant. 





 &#8211; The Company records trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts. On a periodic basis
 the Company evaluates its accounts receivable and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its history of write-offs and collections and current credit conditions. Accounts receivable are written off when management deems them to be uncollectible. 





 &#8211; Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market
 using the first-in
 first-out method. When necessary
 the Company provides allowances to adjust the carrying value of its inventories to the lower of cost or net realizable value
 including any costs to sell or dispose and consideration for obsolescence
 excessive inventory levels
 product deterioration and other factors in evaluating net realizable value. 



Property
 Plant and Equipment



 plant and equipment are recorded at cost. The Company provides for depreciation on the straight-line method by charges to income at rates based upon estimated recovery periods of 7 years for furniture and office equipment
 5 years for automotive equipment
 9 years for refrigeration equipment
 5 to 10 years for machinery and equipment
 and 15 to 39 years for building and improvements. Capitalized cost includes the costs incurred to bring the property
 plant and equipment to the condition and location necessary for its intended use
 which includes any necessary delivery
 electrical and installation cost for equipment. Maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful life of the assets over two years are charged to expense as incurred. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful lives on the straight-line method. 





 &#8211; The Company evaluates all long-lived assets for impairment. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future net cash flows
 an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to their fair value less estimated costs to sell. Estimating future cash flows and calculating fair value of assets requires significant estimates and assumptions by management. If the carrying amount is not fully recoverable
 an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carry amount to fair value
 and is charged to expense in the period of impairment. 





&#8211; The Company provides for deferred income taxes for temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting
 principally net operating loss carryforwards
 depreciation
 and share-based compensation. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 

 the deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December&#160;31
 2017
 and 2016
 the Company determined that a valuation allowance of 100% is appropriate. 





&#8211; Revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment to the customers as terms are free on board (&#8220;FOB&#8221;) shipping point
 at which point title and risk of loss is transferred and the selling price is fixed or determinable. This completes the revenue-earning process specifically that an arrangement exists
 delivery has occurred
 ownership has transferred
 the price is fixed and collectability is reasonably assured. A provision for payment discounts and product return allowances
 which is estimated based upon the Company&#8217;s historical performance
 management&#8217;s experience and current economic trends
 is recorded as a reduction of sales in the same period that the revenue is recognized. 

 consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances and merchandising funds
 and consumer coupons are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of estimated trade incentive spending
 which is recognized as incurred at the time of sale. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are included as accrued expense in the consolidated balance sheet. Coupon redemption costs are also recognized as reductions of net sales when the coupons are issued. Estimates of trade promotion expense and coupon redemption costs are based upon programs offered
 timing of those offers
 estimated redemption/usage rates from historical performance
 management&#8217;s experience and current economic trends. 





 &#8211; Advertising costs are expensed when incurred
 with the exception of production costs which are expensed the first time advertising takes place. Advertising costs
 consisting primarily of media ads
 were $22
127
170
 $15
374
392
 and $16
302
237
 in 2017
 2016
 and 2015
 respectively. 





 &#8211; Costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in selling
 general
 and administrative expenses within the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Shipping and handling costs primarily consist of costs associated with moving finished products to customers
 including costs associated with our distribution center and the cost of shipping products to customers through third-party carriers. Shipping and handling cost totaled $12

 and $11

 2016
 and 2015
 respectively.











 &#8211; The Company recognizes share-based compensation based on the value of the portion of share-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period. Share-based compensation expense recognized in the statement of operations included compensation expense for share-based payment awards granted subsequent to December 31
 2006
 based on the grant date fair value estimated. Share awards are amortized under the straight-line method over the requisite service period of the entire award. Upon the adoption of ASU 2016-09
 the Company no longer estimates expected forfeitures but accounts for forfeitures as they occur.

 whichever is more reliably measurable. 





 &#8211; Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) guidance specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources
 while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). 



















 either directly or indirectly (e.g.
 quoted prices of similar assets or liabilities in active markets
 or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active). Level 2 includes financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies.

 other receivables
 accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments. The warrant liability is recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss.

 the Company only maintained Level 1 assets and liabilities.

Risk-free interest rate

The estimated measure of the percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.













































































































































































Expected term of share-based compensation awards
