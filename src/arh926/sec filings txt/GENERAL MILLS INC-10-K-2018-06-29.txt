We are a leading global manufacturer
and marketer of branded consumer foods sold through retail stores. We also are a leading supplier of branded and unbranded food products to the North American foodservice and commercial baking industries. Following our acquisition of Blue Buffalo
Pet Products
 Inc. (Blue Buffalo) in fiscal 2018
 we are also a leading manufacturer and marketer in the wholesome natural pet food category. We manufacture our products in 13 countries and market them in more than 100 countries. In addition to our
consolidated operations
 we have 50&nbsp;percent interests in two strategic joint ventures that manufacture and market food products sold in more than 130 countries worldwide. 

 2018
 we acquired Blue Buffalo for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0&nbsp;billion. We financed the transaction with a combination of
$6.0&nbsp;billion in debt
 $1.0&nbsp;billion in equity
 lag.
Accordingly
 in fiscal 2018
 our Consolidated Statements of Earnings do not include Pet operating segment results. For further information on the acquisition of Blue Buffalo

We manage and review the financial results of our business under five operating segments: North America Retail; Convenience

 please refer to Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. During fiscal 2018
 Walmart Inc. and its affiliates (Walmart) accounted for 21&nbsp;percent of our consolidated net sales and 30&nbsp;percent of net sales of our North America Retail

The packaged foods categories are highly competitive
 with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the United States and
throughout the world. The categories in which we participate also are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers
 as well as retailers with their own branded products. Competitors market and sell their products
 All of our principal competitors have substantial financial
 marketing
 and other
resources. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation
 product quality
 price
 brand recognition and loyalty
 effectiveness of marketing
 promotional activity
 convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer
 and the
ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include unique consumer insights
 effective customer relationships
 superior product quality
 innovative advertising
 product
promotion
 product innovation aligned with consumers&#146; needs
 an efficient supply chain
 and price. In most product categories
 we compete not only with other widely advertised
 branded products
 but also with regional brands and with generic
and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Internationally
 we compete with both multi-national and local manufacturers
 and each country includes a unique group of competitors. 
Raw materials
 ingredients
The principal raw materials that we use are grains (wheat
 oats
 and corn)
 dairy products
 sugar
fruits
 vegetable oils
 meats
 nuts
 vegetables
 and other agricultural products. We also use substantial quantities of carton board
 corrugated
 plastic and metal packaging materials
 operating supplies
 and energy. Most of these inputs for our
domestic and Canadian operations are purchased from suppliers in the United States. In our other international operations
 inputs that are not locally available in adequate supply may be imported from other countries. The cost of these inputs may
fluctuate widely due to external conditions such as weather
 product scarcity
 limited sources of supply
 commodity market fluctuations
 currency fluctuations
 and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. We have
some long-term fixed price contracts
 but the majority of our inputs are purchased on the open market. We believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of needed inputs. Occasionally and where possible
 we make advance purchases of items
significant to our business in order to ensure continuity of operations. Our objective is to procure materials meeting both our quality standards and our production needs at price levels that allow a targeted profit margin. Since these inputs
generally represent the largest variable cost in manufacturing our products
 to the extent possible
 we often manage the risk associated with adverse price movements for some inputs using a variety of risk management strategies. We also have a grain
merchandising operation that provides us efficient access to
 and more informed knowledge of
 various commodity markets
 principally wheat and oats. This operation holds physical inventories that are carried at net realizable value and uses
derivatives to manage its net inventory position and minimize its market exposures.

 Walmart accounted for 21&nbsp;percent of our consolidated net sales and 30&nbsp;percent of net sales of our North America Retail
segment. In its fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31
 2017
 PetSmart (including Chewy.com as of June&nbsp;1

Price changes for the
commodities we depend on for raw materials
 packaging
The principal raw materials that we use are
commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather
 product scarcity
 limited sources of supply
 commodity market fluctuations
 currency fluctuations
 and changes in governmental agricultural and energy
policies and regulations. Commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material
 packaging
 and energy costs. If we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices
 we may experience
reduced margins and profitability. We do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices
 and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend. 
Volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and
We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs
 including grains (oats
 wheat
 and
corn)
 oils (principally soybean)
 dairy products
 natural gas
 and diesel fuel. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently
 resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses are
reported in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocated corporate items outside our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process
 at which time the gains and losses are
reclassified to segment operating profit. We also record our grain inventories at net realizable value. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments. 
If we are not efficient in our production
 our profitability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate. 

markets. Gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs 
 






resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position. Many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of
manufacturing facilities and production lines. Such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production
 which may negatively impact product volume and margins. We are currently pursuing several multi-year restructuring and cost
savings initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce expenses. If we are unable to execute those initiatives as planned
 we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits
 which could adversely affect our business and results

capabilities due to weather
 including any potential effects of climate change
 natural disaster
 fire
 terrorism

 or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our

Concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certain food
We could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain
food products or ingredients. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns

If our products become adulterated

 or mislabeled
 we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers
We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated
 misbranded
 or mislabeled. A widespread product
recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall
 the destruction of product inventory
 and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability
judgment against us. A significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity
 damage to our reputation
 and a loss of consumer confidence in our products
 which could have an adverse effect on our business
We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends
 which may result in decreased demand
Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes
 eating habits and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to
offer products that appeal to their preferences in channels where they shop. Consumer preferences and category-level consumption may change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors. If we fail to
anticipate
 identify or react to these changes and trends
 channels
 or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis
 we may experience reduced demand for
our products
 which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer. Similarly
 demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium
 trans fats
 genetically modified
organisms
 sugar
 processed wheat
 or other product ingredients or attributes. 
 





We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable
The food industry&#146;s growth potential is constrained by population growth. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our
business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve. One way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories. Our future results will also
depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories. If we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories
 our growth may slow
 which could adversely affect our profitability. 


 consumers may purchase
more generic
 private label
 and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether. In those circumstances
 we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. In
addition
 as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions
 we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins. Consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase
products from our Convenience Stores&nbsp;&amp; Foodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 


large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors
 including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner
 adverse
publicity about our products
 our failure to maintain the quality of our products
 the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences
 concerns about food safety
 or our products becoming unavailable to consumers.
Consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support. The use of social and digital media by consumers
 us
 and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or
misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us

Global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity

We depend on stable
 liquid
 and well-functioning capital and credit markets to
fund our operations. Although we believe that our operating cash flows
 financial assets
 access to capital and credit markets
 and revolving credit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future
 there can be no
assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. We also utilize interest rate derivatives to reduce the volatility of our financing costs. If we are
not effective in hedging this volatility
 we may experience an increase in our costs of borrowing. Our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets
Volatility in the securities markets

globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in interest rates
 mortality rates
 health care costs
 early retirement rates

defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of
Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately
Information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business. We rely on information
technology networks and systems
 including the internet
 to process
 transmit
 and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes and to comply with regulatory
 legal
 and tax requirements. Our information technology systems
and infrastructure are critical to effectively manage our key business processes including digital marketing
 order entry and fulfillment
 supply chain management
 finance
 administration
 and other business processes. These technologies enable
internal and external communication among our locations
 employees
 suppliers
 customers
 and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about our employees
 consumers
 and proprietary business information. Our information
technology systems
 some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties
 may be vulnerable to damage
 interruption
 or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events
 natural disasters
 fires
 power outages
 systems
failures
 telecommunications failures
 security breaches
 computer viruses
 hackers
 employee error or malfeasance
 and other causes. Increased cyber-security threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology
systems
 as well as the confidentiality
 integrity
 and availability of the data stored on those systems. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors
processing inefficiencies

A change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different
weighted-average cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth. 

 2018
 we had $20.9&nbsp;billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for
impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
 






that impairment may have occurred. We compare the carrying value of the reporting unit
 including goodwill
 to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is
less than the carrying value of the reporting unit
 including goodwill
 impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from
our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates
 perpetuity growth assumptions
 market comparables
 and other factors. Our Latin America and U.S. Yogurt reporting units have experienced declining business performance and we
continue to monitor these businesses. While we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired

In addition

 even if Blue Buffalo is integrated successfully
 the full anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized
 including the synergies

 or at all. Further
 additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process. All of these factors could cause reductions in our earnings

 we announced a new global
organization structure to streamline our leadership
 enhance global scale
 and drive improved operational agility to maximize our growth capabilities.&nbsp;We restated our fiscal 2016 net sales by segment and segment operating profit amounts to
reflect our new operating segments. These segment changes had no effect on previously reported consolidated net sales

The primary source of our
liquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent three-year period
 our operations have generated $8.0&nbsp;billion in cash. A substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to shareholders through share repurchases
and dividends. We also use cash from operations to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions. We typically use a combination of cash
 notes payable
 and long-term debt and occasionally issue shares of stock to finance significant acquisitions

 we have recorded a provisional estimate for local country withholding taxes related to certain
entities from which we expect to begin repatriating undistributed earnings. As a result of the transition tax
 we may repatriate our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further U.S. income
tax liability. In fiscal 2018
 we repatriated a portion of our foreign cash holdings to finance part of the Blue Buffalo acquisition

In fiscal 2018
 cash provided by operations was $2.8&nbsp;billion compared to $2.4&nbsp;billion in fiscal 2017. The
$426&nbsp;million increase was primarily driven by the $462&nbsp;million increase in net earnings and the $736&nbsp;million change in current assets and liabilities
 partially offset by a $688&nbsp;million change in deferred income taxes. The change
in deferred income taxes was primarily related to the $638&nbsp;million provisional benefit from revaluing our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities to reflect the new U.S. corporate tax rate as a result of the TCJA. The $736&nbsp;million change in
current assets and liabilities was primarily due to changes in accounts payable of $476&nbsp;million related to the extension of payment terms and timing of payments
 and $264&nbsp;million of changes in other current liabilities primarily driven by
changes in income taxes payable
 trade and advertising accruals
We strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of
growth in our net sales. For fiscal 2018

In fiscal 2017
 our
operations generated $2.4&nbsp;billion of cash
 compared to $2.8&nbsp;billion in fiscal 2016. The $349&nbsp;million decrease was primarily driven by a $493&nbsp;million change in current assets and liabilities.&nbsp;The $493&nbsp;million change in
current assets and liabilities was primarily due to changes in other current liabilities driven by changes in income taxes payable
 a decrease in incentive accruals
 and changes in trade and advertising accruals due to reduced spending. The change
in current assets and liabilities was also impacted by the timing of accounts payable.&nbsp;Additionally
 we recorded a $14&nbsp;million loss on a divestiture during fiscal 2017
 compared to a $148&nbsp;million net gain on divestitures during fiscal
2016
 and classified the related cash flows as investing activities.

 primarily driven by an increase in long-term debt. 

Sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of these entities. We consolidate these entities into our consolidated financial statements. We record Sodiaal&#146;s 50&nbsp;percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Libert&eacute; Marques

 including
the underfunded status of certain of our defined benefit pension
 other postretirement benefit
 and postemployment benefit plans
 and miscellaneous liabilities. We expect to pay $20&nbsp;million of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit
plans and $18&nbsp;million of deferred compensation in fiscal 2019. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2019. As of May&nbsp;27
 2018
 our total liability for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest and
penalties was $223.6&nbsp;million. 

 please see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Our
significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact 
 






on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. These estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures
 valuation of long-lived assets
 intangible assets
redeemable interest
 stock-based compensation
 income taxes
 and defined benefit pension
 other postretirement benefit
 and postemployment benefit plans. 
Our promotional
activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers. These activities include: payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf
 such as advertising or
 displays; discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices; payments to gain distribution of new products; coupons
 contests
 and other incentives; and media and advertising expenditures. The
recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels. These estimates are based on the forecasted customer sales
 the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities
 and other factors. Differences
between estimated expenses and actual costs are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade
 coupon
 and consumer marketing liabilities were $500&nbsp;million as of May&nbsp;27
 2018
 and $483&nbsp;million
as of May&nbsp;28
 2017. Because our total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues) are significant
 if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a
significant effect on our results of operations. 

circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals
 as appropriate. 
Goodwill and other
indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment
testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. We use inputs from our long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits. We also make estimates of discount rates
 perpetuity growth assumptions
 market
comparables
We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets
 mainly brands
 to determine if they are finite or
indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence
 demand
 competition
 other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry
 known
technological advances
 legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment
 and expected changes in distribution channels)
 the level of required maintenance expenditures
 and the expected lives of other related
groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis
 over their useful lives
 generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. Our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a
discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our long-range plan
 assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands
 and a discount rate. 

 2018
 we had $20.9&nbsp;billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair value of each
intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows
 materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of
capital could result in material impairment losses and amortization expense. We performed our fiscal 2018 assessment of our intangible assets as of August&nbsp;28
 2017. As of our annual assessment date
 there was no impairment of any of our
intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values except for&nbsp;the
 






&nbsp;brand intangible
assets and the Latin America reporting unit was as follows:

Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in
excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow. The actual impact on future years&#146; cash flows will depend
 in part
 on
the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes.
Realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards are recognized in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings. Because employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control
 it is possible that significantly different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. 


 we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50&nbsp;percent likelihood of being

Defined Benefit Pension
 Other Postretirement Benefit
 and Postemployment Benefit
We have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States
 Canada
 Switzerland
 France
 and the United Kingdom. We
also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States
 Canada
 and Brazil. Under certain circumstances
 we also provide accruable benefits
 primarily severance
 to former and inactive employees in the
United States
 Canada
 and Mexico. Please see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a description of our defined benefit pension
 other postretirement benefit
 and postemployment benefit plans. 

 we make various
assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit
expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets
 the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans
 and health care cost trend rates. 
Our expected rate
of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation
 our historical long-term investment performance
 our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries
 investment services
 and investment managers)
and long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan; however
 our annual investment performance for one particular year does not
 by itself
 significantly influence our evaluation.

volatility. The market-related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated
using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income. 
Beginning in fiscal 2017
 we changed the
method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our United States and most of our international defined benefit pension
 other postretirement benefit
 and postemployment benefit plans. We
adopted a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. This method provides a more
precise measurement of service and interest costs by correlating the timing of the plans&#146; liability cash flows to the corresponding rate on the yield curve. Previously
 we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weighted-average
discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. This change does not affect the measurement of our benefit obligations related to these plans. We have accounted for this change
Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as
of May&nbsp;31 for our defined benefit pension
 other postretirement benefit
 and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants
and
 using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield
 to develop a forward interest rate curve
 including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine
our discount rate assumptions.

period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as &#147;all or almost all&#148; inactive participants. 
We review our health care
cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience
 plan design
 overall industry experience and
projections
 and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review
 recent experiences
 and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost
trend rate assumption is 7.0&nbsp;percent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.7&nbsp;percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2018. Rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5&nbsp;percent is reached in 2029 for
all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees&#146; benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually
 as necessary
 to approximate the current economic view on
the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.

plan is viewed as &#147;all or almost all&#148; inactive participants. 

 we recorded net defined benefit pension
 other postretirement benefit
 and postemployment benefit plan expense of $23&nbsp;million compared to
$56&nbsp;million of expense in fiscal 2017 and $163&nbsp;million of expense in fiscal 2016. As of May&nbsp;27
 2018
 we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $1.8&nbsp;billion on our defined benefit pension plans and cumulative
unrecognized actuarial net gains of $40&nbsp;million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans
 mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates
 partially offset by recent increases in the values of plan assets.
These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP. 

 other postretirement benefit
 and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment
performance
 changes in future discount rates
 changes in health care cost trend rates
 and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans. 
 





 

 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new hedge accounting requirements. The new standard amends the hedge accounting
recognition and presentation requirements to better align an entity&#146;s risk management activities and financial reporting. The new standard also simplifies the application of hedge accounting guidance. The requirements of the new standard are
effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15
 2018
 and interim periods within those annual periods
 which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of analyzing the
In March 2017
 the FASB issued new accounting requirements related to the
presentation of net periodic defined benefit pension expense
 net periodic postretirement benefit expense
 and net periodic postemployment benefit expense. The new standard requires the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense to be
recorded in the same line items as other employee compensation costs within our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Other components of net periodic benefit expense must be presented separately outside of operating profit in our Consolidated
Statements of Earnings. In addition
 the new standard requires that only the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense is eligible for capitalization. We recognized net periodic benefit expense of $23&nbsp;million in fiscal 2018
$56&nbsp;million in fiscal 2017
 and $163&nbsp;million in fiscal 2016 of which $123&nbsp;million
 $141&nbsp;million
 and $161&nbsp;million
 respectively
 related to service cost. These amounts may not necessarily be indicative of future amounts that
may be recognized subsequent to the adoption of this new standard. The new standard requires retrospective adoption of the presentation of net periodic benefit expense and prospective application of the capitalization of the service cost component.
The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15
 2017
 and interim periods within those annual periods
 which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2019. 

 the FASB issued new accounting requirements for accounting
 presentation and classification of leases. This will result in most leases being
capitalized as a right of use asset with a related liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15
 2018
 and interim periods within those
annual periods
 which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We are in the process of implementing lease accounting software and analyzing the impact of this standard on our results of operations and financial position. Based on our assessment
to date
 we expect this guidance will have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets due to the amount of our lease commitments but we are unable to quantify the impact at this time. 

 the FASB issued new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. Under the new guidance
 companies will
apply a principles-based five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods
and services. The requirements of the new standard and its subsequent amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15
 2017
 and interim periods within those annual periods
 which for us is the first quarter of
fiscal 2019. We will adopt these requirements using the cumulative effect approach. We have evaluated and documented the impact of the guidance on our current accounting policies and practices and have not identified any material differences
resulting from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts. Additionally
 we did not identify any significant changes to our business processes
 systems
 and controls to support recognition and disclosure requirements under the new
guidance. This guidance will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.

Item&nbsp;7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
We are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices. Changes in
these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. In the normal 
 






course of business
 we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions
 authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these
activities. The counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions. We establish credit limits for each counterparty. Our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments.
For information on interest rate
 foreign exchange
 commodity price
 and equity instrument risk
 please see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
The estimates in the table below are
intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates
 foreign exchange rates
 commodity prices


The VAR calculation used historical interest and foreign exchange rates
 and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the
potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future. The market data were drawn from the RiskMetrics&#153; data set. The calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur. Further
 since the
hedging instrument (the derivative) inversely correlates with the underlying exposure
 we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the
underlying exposure. The positions included in the calculations were: debt; investments; interest rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards; commodity swaps
 futures
 and options; and equity instruments. The calculations do not include the underlying

As part of a long-term plan to conform the fiscal year ends of all our operations
 in fiscal 2017 we changed the reporting period
 to match our fiscal
calendar. Accordingly
 in fiscal 2017
 our results included 13 months of results from the affected operations. The impact of these changes was not material to our consolidated results of operations. Our General Mills India business and Pet operating
In fiscal 2016 we changed the reporting period of Yoplait SAS and Yoplait Marques SNC within our
Europe&nbsp;&amp; Australia segment and Annie&#146;s

to match our fiscal calendar. Accordingly
 in fiscal 2016
 our results included 13 months of results from the affected operations. The impact of these changes was not material to our consolidated results of operations.

occurred. In fiscal 2016
 we changed the date of our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment from the first day of the third quarter to the first day of the second quarter to more closely align with the timing of
our annual long-range planning process. Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We compare the carrying value of a reporting unit
 including goodwill
 to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and
liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit
 which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value
 impairment has occurred. We
recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a
discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates

estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included projected revenues from our long-range plan
 assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands
 and a discount rate.
Our finite-lived intangible assets
 primarily acquired franchise agreements and customer relationships
 are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset are less than the
carrying amount of the asset. Assets generally have identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other assets. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. Fair
value is measured using a discounted cash flow model or other similar valuation model
Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
Our investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are stated at cost plus our share of undistributed
earnings or losses. We receive royalty income from certain joint ventures
 incur various expenses (primarily research and development)
 and record the tax impact of certain joint venture operations that are structured as partnerships. In addition
we make advances to our joint ventures in the form of loans or capital investments. We also sell certain raw materials
 semi-finished goods
 and finished goods to the joint ventures
 generally at market prices. 
 






 we assess our investments in our joint ventures if we have reason to believe an impairment may
have occurred including
 but not limited to
 as a result of ongoing operating losses
 projected decreases in earnings
 increases in the weighted average cost of capital
 or significant business disruptions. The significant assumptions used to
estimate fair value include revenue growth and profitability
 royalty rates
 capital spending
 depreciation and taxes
 foreign currency exchange rates
 and a discount rate. By their nature
 these projections and assumptions are uncertain. If we were
to determine the current fair value of our investment was less than the carrying value of the investment
 then we would assess if the shortfall was of a temporary or permanent nature and write down the investment to its fair value if we concluded
the impairment is other than temporary. 

 a consolidated entity. Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) holds the remaining 49&nbsp;percent
interest in Yoplait SAS. Sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year
 up to three times before December 2024. This put option requires us to classify Sodiaal&#146;s interest as a
redeemable interest outside of equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for as long as the put is exercisable by Sodiaal. When the put is no longer exercisable
 the redeemable interest will be reclassified to noncontrolling interests on our
 capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets quarterly to the redeemable interest&#146;s redemption value
which approximates its fair value. During the second quarter of fiscal 2018
 we adjusted the redeemable interest&#146;s redemption value based on a discounted cash flow model. The significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include
projected revenue growth and profitability from our long-range plan

 except for gains and losses on investments in subsidiaries for which settlement is not planned for the foreseeable
future and foreign exchange gains and losses on instruments designated as net investment hedges. These gains and losses are recorded in AOCI. 
All derivatives are
recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value based on quoted market prices or our estimate of their fair value
 and are recorded in either current or noncurrent assets or liabilities based on their maturity. Changes in the fair values
of derivatives are recorded in net earnings or other comprehensive income
 based on whether the instrument is designated and effective as a hedge transaction and
 if so
 the type of hedge transaction. Gains or losses on derivative instruments
reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist
 any associated amounts reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings at that time. Any
ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings in the current period.

Certain
equity-based compensation plans contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon retirement
 termination

award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service. Accordingly
 the related compensation cost is generally recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible individuals or over the period from the grant date to the date

circumstances
 we also provide accruable benefits

 and Mexico. We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service.
Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded. 

In fiscal 2018
 we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and
the supplemental pension plans that resulted in the spinoff of a portion of the General Mills Pension Plan (the Plan) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Retirement Plan (Grandfathered) (together
 the Supplemental Plans)
into new plans effective May&nbsp;31
 2018. The benefits offered to the plans&#146; participants were unchanged. The result of the reorganization was the creation of the General Mills Pension Plan I (Plan I) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan
I and the Supplemental Retirement Plan I (Grandfathered) (together
 
 






the Supplemental Plans I). The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investment strategy over time and to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and
volatility. Actuarial gains and losses associated with the Plan and the Supplemental Plans are amortized over the average remaining service period of the active participants. Actuarial gains and losses associated with the Plan I and the Supplemental
Plans I are amortized over the average remaining life of the participants. Please refer to Note 13 for a description of our defined benefit pension
 other postretirement benefit
 and postemployment benefit plans. 
Preparing our Consolidated
Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities

liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures

In
the third quarter of fiscal 2018
 we adopted new accounting requirements that provide the option to reclassify stranded income tax effects resulting from the TCJA from AOCI to retained earnings. We elected to reclassify the stranded income tax
effects of the TCJA of $329.4&nbsp;million from AOCI to retained earnings. This reclassification consists of deferred taxes originally recorded in AOCI that exceed the newly enacted federal corporate tax rate. The new accounting requirements allow
In the first quarter of
fiscal 2018
 we adopted new requirements for the accounting and presentation of stock-based payments. The adoption of this guidance resulted in the prospective recognition of realized windfall and shortfall tax benefits related to the exercise or
 within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recognized a windfall tax benefit in income
tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings of $25.2&nbsp;million in fiscal 2018. We retrospectively adopted the guidance related to reclassification of realized windfall tax benefits in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This
resulted in reclassifications of $25.2&nbsp;million
 $64.1&nbsp;million
 and $94.1&nbsp;million of cash provided by financing activities to operating activities for fiscal 2018
 fiscal 2017
 and fiscal 2016
 respectively. Additionally
 we
retrospectively adopted the guidance related to reclassification of employee tax withholdings in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This resulted in reclassifications of $26.8&nbsp;million
 $37.8&nbsp;million
 and $40.3&nbsp;million of cash
used by operating activities to financing activities for fiscal 2018
 fiscal 2017
 and fiscal 2016
 respectively. Stock-based compensation expense continues to reflect estimated forfeitures. 

 we adopted new accounting requirements which permit reporting entities to measure a goodwill impairment loss by the
amount by which a reporting unit&#146;s carrying value exceeds the reporting unit&#146;s fair value. Previously
 goodwill impairment losses were required to be measured by determining the implied fair value of goodwill. Our annual goodwill
impairment test was performed as of the first day of the second quarter of fiscal 2018
 and the adoption of this guidance did not impact our results of operations or financial position.

On April&nbsp;24
2018
 we acquired Blue Buffalo Pet Products
 Inc. (&#147;Blue Buffalo&#148;) for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0&nbsp;billion
 including $103.0&nbsp;million of consideration for net debt repaid at the time of the acquisition. In accordance with
the definitive agreement and plan of merger
 a subsidiary of General Mills merged into Blue Buffalo
 with Blue Buffalo surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of General Mills. In accordance with the merger agreement
 equity holders of
Blue Buffalo received $40.00 per share in cash. We financed the transaction with a combination of $6.0&nbsp;billion in debt
 $1.0&nbsp;billion in equity
 and cash on hand. The acquisition accelerates our portfolio reshaping strategy. In fiscal 2018
we recorded acquisition transaction and integration costs of $34.0&nbsp;million recorded in selling
 general
 and administrative expenses and $49.9&nbsp;million in interest
 net related to the debt issued to finance the acquisition. 

 an indefinite lived intangible asset for the
Blue Buffalo brand of $2.7&nbsp;billion
 and a finite lived customer relationship asset of $269.0&nbsp;million. The goodwill was primarily attributable to future growth opportunities and any intangible assets that did not qualify for separate
recognition. The goodwill is included in the Pet reporting unit and is not deductible for tax purposes. We have conducted a preliminary assessment of certain assets and liabilities related to the acquisition of Blue Buffalo. We are continuing our
review of these items during the measurement period
 and if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date
 the acquisition accounting will be revised to reflect the resulting adjustments to current

NOTE 4. RESTRUCTURING
 IMPAIRMENT
 AND OTHER EXIT COSTS 
In fiscal 2018
 we recorded

 Yoki
 brand intangible assets in restructuring
 impairment
 and other exit costs. Please see Note 6 for additional information.
We view our restructuring
activities as actions that help us meet our long-term growth targets. Activities we undertake must meet internal rate of return and net present value targets. Each restructuring action normally takes one to two years to complete. At completion (or
as each major stage is completed in the case of multi-year programs)
 the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation. These activities result in various restructuring costs
 including asset write-offs
 exit charges including
severance
 contract termination fees
 and decommissioning and other costs. Accelerated depreciation associated with restructured assets
 as used in the context of our disclosures regarding restructuring activity
 refers to the increase in
depreciation expense caused by shortening the useful life or updating the salvage value of depreciable fixed assets to coincide with the end of production under an approved restructuring plan. Any impairment of the asset is recognized immediately in
We are currently pursuing several multi-year restructuring initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and focus our
business behind our key growth strategies. Charges recorded in fiscal 2018 related to these initiatives were as follows:

In the fourth quarter of 2018
 we approved global cost savings initiatives designed to reduce administrative costs and align
resources behind high growth initiatives. These actions will affect approximately 625 positions
 and we expect to incur approximately $55&nbsp;million of net expenses relating to these actions
 most of which will be cash. We recorded
$49.3&nbsp;million of restructuring charges relating to these actions in fiscal 2018. We expect these actions to be completed by the end of fiscal 2019.

As of May&nbsp;27

 we did not any have cash and cash equivalents pledged as collateral for derivative contracts. As of
May&nbsp;27
 2018
The fair
value and carrying amounts of long-term debt
 including the current portion
 were $14
169.7&nbsp;million and $14
268.8&nbsp;million
 respectively
 as of May&nbsp;27
 2018. The fair value of long-term debt was estimated using market quotations and
discounted cash flows based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments. Long-term debt is a Level&nbsp;2 liability in the fair value hierarchy. 
As a part of our ongoing
operations
 we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity and equity prices. To manage these risks
 we may enter into various derivative transactions (e.g.
 futures
 options
 and swaps)
pursuant to our established policies. 

our principal ingredients and energy costs
 including grains (oats
 wheat
 and corn)
 oils (principally soybean)
 dairy products
 natural gas
 and diesel fuel. Our primary objective when entering into these derivative contracts is to achieve
certainty with regard to the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. We manage our exposures through a combination of purchase orders
 long-term contracts with suppliers
 exchange-traded futures and options


We use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices. We do not perform the assessments required to achieve
hedge accounting for commodity derivative positions. Accordingly
 the changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded currently in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 

 we believe that these instruments are effective in achieving our objective of providing
certainty in the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. Accordingly
 for purposes of measuring segment operating performance these gains and losses are reported in unallocated corporate items outside of segment operating
results until such time that the exposure we are managing affects earnings. At that time we reclassify the gain or loss from unallocated corporate items to segment operating profit
 allowing our operating segments to realize the economic effects of
 volatility
 which remains in unallocated corporate items.

As of May&nbsp;27
 2018
 the net notional value of commodity derivatives was $238.8&nbsp;million
 of which $147.9&nbsp;million
related to agricultural inputs and $90.9&nbsp;million related to energy inputs. These contracts relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the next 12 months. 
We are exposed to interest rate
volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed-rate debt
 and existing and future issuances of floating-rate debt. Primary exposures include U.S. Treasury rates
 LIBOR
 Euribor
 and commercial paper rates in the United States and Europe. We use
interest rate swaps
 forward-starting interest rate swaps
 and treasury locks to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes
 to reduce the volatility of our financing costs
 and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed rate versus floating-rate
debt
 based on current and projected market conditions. Generally under these swaps
 we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount.
 interest rate
swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges
 as are all hedges of forecasted issuances of debt. Effectiveness is assessed based on either the perfectly effective hypothetical derivative method or changes in the present value of interest payments on
the underlying debt. Effective gains and losses deferred to AOCI are reclassified into earnings over the life of the associated debt. Ineffective gains and losses are recorded as net interest. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was a

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES
Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain an investment grade credit rating on our debt from each of the
major credit rating agencies. If our debt were to fall below investment grade
 the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of
all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on May&nbsp;27

 was $7.2&nbsp;million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts. If the credit-risk-related contingent features

We have defined benefit
pension plans covering many employees in the United States
 Canada
 Switzerland
 France
 and the United Kingdom. Benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include
various monthly amounts for each year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. We made no voluntary contributions to our principal U.S. plans in fiscal 2018
 2017
 and 2016. We do not expect to
be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2019. Our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five
years of a change in control. All salaried employees hired on or after June&nbsp;1
 2013
 are eligible for a retirement program that does not include a defined benefit pension plan. 

 we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and the supplemental pension plans that resulted in
the spinoff of a portion of the General Mills Pension Plan (the Plan) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Retirement Plan (Grandfathered) (together
 the Supplemental Plans) into new plans effective May&nbsp;31
 2018. The
benefits offered to the plans&#146; participants were unchanged. The result of the reorganization was the creation of the General Mills Pension Plan I (Plan I) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan I and the Supplemental Retirement Plan I
(Grandfathered) (together
 the Supplemental Plans I). The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investment strategy over time and to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains
and losses associated with the Plan and the Supplemental Plans are amortized over the average remaining service life of the active participants. Actuarial gains and losses associated with the Plan I and the Supplemental Plans I are amortized over
In May 2017
 we announced changes to the United States pension plans. The Company will freeze the pay and
service amounts used to calculate pension benefits for active employees who participate in the United States 
 






pension plans as of December&nbsp;31
 2027. Beginning January&nbsp;1
 2028
 active employees in the United States will not accrue additional benefits for future service and eligible compensation
received under these plans. These changes resulted in a $130.9&nbsp;million decline in the projected benefit obligation as of May&nbsp;28
 2017
 due to the decrease in expected future compensation. 
We also sponsor plans
that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States
 Canada
 and Brazil. The United States salaried health care benefit plan is contributory
 with retiree contributions based on years of service. We make decisions to fund
related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis. We made no voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2018 and $20.0&nbsp;million in fiscal 2017. 
Assumed health care cost
trends are as follows: 




























































We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims
experience and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience
 plan design
 overall industry experience and projections
 and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend
rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review
 recent experiences
 and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 7.0&nbsp;percent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.7&nbsp;percent for
retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2018. Rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5&nbsp;percent is reached in 2029 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees&#146;
benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually
 as necessary
 to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed
A one percentage point
change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects:

 we adopted the full yield curve method. 

 we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our United
States and most of our international defined benefit pension
 other postretirement benefit
 and postemployment benefit plans. We adopted a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along
the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. This method provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by correlating the timing of the plans&#146; liability cash flows to the
corresponding rate on the yield curve. Previously
 we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. This
change does not affect the measurement of our benefit obligations related to these plans. We have accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 

 our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of May&nbsp;31 for our defined benefit pension
 other postretirement
benefit
 and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We also use discount rates as of May&nbsp;31 to determine defined benefit pension
 other postretirement benefit
 and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year.
We work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and
 using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield
 to develop a forward interest rate curve
 including a margin to that
index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions.

Our expected rate
of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation
 our historical long-term investment performance
 our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries
 investment services
 and investment managers)
and long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan; however
 our annual investment performance for one particular year does not
 by itself
 significantly influence our evaluation. 

















































































































































































The investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit
obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us. Our goal is to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan portfolios are broadly
diversified across asset classes. Within asset classes
 the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations. For the defined benefit pension plans
 the long-term investment policy allocation is:
20&nbsp;percent to equities in the United States; 15&nbsp;percent to international equities; 10&nbsp;percent to private equities; 40&nbsp;percent to fixed income; and 15&nbsp;percent to real assets (real estate
 energy
 and infrastructure). For
other postretirement benefit plans
 the long-term investment policy allocations are: 15&nbsp;percent to equities in the United States; 10&nbsp;percent to international equities; 5&nbsp;percent to private equities; 65&nbsp;percent to fixed income;
and 5&nbsp;percent to real assets (real estate
 energy
 and timber). The actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations. 
We do not
expect to be required to make contributions to our defined benefit pension
 other postretirement benefit
 and postemployment benefit plans in fiscal 2019. Actual fiscal 2019 contributions could exceed our current projections
 as influenced by our
decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts and future changes in regulatory requirements. Estimated benefit payments
 which reflect expected future service
 as appropriate
 are expected to be paid from fiscal 2019 to 2028 as

 or a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction involving a Participant or
Beneficiary)
 it believes that a Participant or Beneficiary has recognized or will recognize income for federal income tax purposes with respect to amounts that are or will be payable under the Plan before they are to be paid. In making this
determination
 the Minor Amendment Committee shall take into account the hardship that would be imposed on the Participant or Beneficiary by the payment of federal income taxes under such circumstances. 
. In the event the dollar amount of the Maximum Benefit increases as a
result of federal legislation
 the benefits of any Participant payable under the Plan
 whether or not in pay status

already commenced under the provisions of the applicable Base Plan and the Plan
 benefit amounts under both Plans shall be adjusted to reflect the higher Maximum Benefit
 by increasing the amount paid under the Base Plan and decreasing the amount
paid under the Plan
 as soon as administratively possible after such a change. Notwithstanding the above
 if a Base Plan is terminated
 no adjustments shall be made to benefits payable under the Plan with respect to changes in the Maximum Benefit
. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Plan
 partial prepayment of benefits may be made from time to time

rate listed in the Wall Street Journal banking survey for the business day coincident with or next following the date of the Participant&#146;s benefit commencement date. 
. In the event the dollar amount of the Maximum Benefit increases as a
result of federal legislation
 the benefits of any Participant payable under the Plan
 whether or not in pay status
 shall be recalculated to take into account the higher Maximum Benefit payable from the applicable Base Plan. If payments have
already commenced under the provisions of the applicable Base Plan and the Plan
 benefit amounts under both Plans shall be adjusted to reflect the higher Maximum Benefit
 by increasing the amount paid under the Base Plan and decreasing the amount
paid under the Plan
 as soon as administratively possible after such a change. Notwithstanding the above

Minneapolis
 N.A. as Trustee to hold assets of the Company under certain circumstances as a reserve for the discharge of the Company&#146;s obligations under the Plan and certain other plans of deferred compensation of the Company. In the event of a
Change in Control as defined in Section&nbsp;2.3 hereof
 the Company shall be obligated to immediately contribute such amounts to the Trust as may be necessary to fully fund all benefits payable under the Plan. Any Participant of the Plan shall have
the right to demand and secure specific performance of this provision. The Company may fund the Trust in the event of the occurrence of a potential Change in Control as determined by the Finance Committee of the Board. All assets held in the Trust
remain subject only to the claims of the Company&#146;s general creditors whose claims against the Company are not satisfied because of the Company&#146;s bankruptcy or insolvency (as those terms are defined in the Trust Agreement). No Participant
has any preferred claim on
 or beneficial ownership interest in
 any assets of the Trust before the assets are paid to the Participant and all rights created under the Trust
 as under the Plan
 are unsecured contractual claims of the Participant

Effective as of

 2018
 this Plan was spun off from the Supplemental Retirement Plan of General Mills
 Inc. (Grandfathered). This Plan is its own legally separate plan
 with its own plan document. However
 no substantive changes are made to the terms of
the Plan which are identical in all substantive ways to the Supplemental Retirement Plan of General Mills
 Inc. (Grandfathered). In this connection
 and to ensure protection of the Plan&#146;s status as grandfathered from the provisions of Code
section 409A
 the remaining portions of this Plan document consist of a copy of the Supplemental Retirement Plan of General Mills
 Inc. (Grandfathered). 

 the following specific provisions are made for clarification purposes: 





 The name of the Plan is the &#147;Supplemental Retirement Plan I of General Mills
 Inc. (Grandfathered)&#148;. 




 The Plan covers the nonqualified accrued benefits (earned or vested prior to January&nbsp;1
 2005) credited to certain participants under the Supplemental Retirement Plan of General Mills
 Inc.
(Grandfathered) who had experienced a Separation from Service before January&nbsp;1
 2018. 




 Eligible individuals who accrued benefits that were earned or vested prior to January&nbsp;1
 2005 and credited under the Supplemental
Retirement Plan of General Mills
 Inc. (Grandfathered) shall be entitled to benefit payments exclusively from either this Plan or the Supplemental Retirement Plan of General Mills
 Inc. (Grandfathered)
 but in no case from both. If for any reason
the intent of the previous sentence is frustrated
 benefits under this Plan shall be offset by the value of any person&#146;s benefit payments under the Supplemental Retirement Plan of General Mills
 Inc. (Grandfathered).

(As Grandfathered Effective January&nbsp;1

 2005
 General Mills
 Inc. amended and restated the Supplemental Retirement Plan of General Mills
 Inc. for the
exclusive benefit of its eligible employees. This is the plan document from which benefits earned and vested (within the meaning of Code section 409A and official guidance thereunder) before January&nbsp;1
 2005 are paid. Benefits earned
 or which
become vested

determination
 the Minor Amendment Committee shall take into account the hardship that would be imposed on the Participant or Beneficiary by the payment of federal income taxes under such circumstances. 
. In the event the dollar amount of the Maximum Benefit increases as a
result of federal legislation

already commenced under the provisions of the applicable Base Plan and the Plan
 benefit amounts under both Plans shall be adjusted to reflect the higher Maximum Benefit

paid under the Plan

 no adjustments shall be made to benefits payable under the Plan with respect to changes in the Maximum Benefit
. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Plan

 the provisions of this Section shall apply. Subject to the aggregate limits of Section&nbsp;4.4
 such Participant shall be
entitled to receive benefits determined under this Section
 in addition to any benefit provided under Section&nbsp;3.3. Such additional benefits shall be in the form of a retirement supplement
 calculated as the difference between an Early
Retirement Pension under the provisions of such Base Plan and a Vested Deferred Pension under such Base Plan. For purposes of clarification
 no additional age or service credit is granted hereunder
 and benefits may not commence prior to the time

the changes required under Section&nbsp;11.4 of said plan shall be entitled to receive such excess benefits under this Plan. 
. Any benefit amount payable under the Plan to a married Participant shall be adjusted and paid in the
form of a joint and 100% to survivor annuity. Any benefit amount payable under the Plan to an unmarried Participant shall be paid in the form of a single life annuity. Notwithstanding the above

. In the event the dollar amount of the Maximum Benefit increases as a
result of federal legislation
 the benefits of any Participant payable under the Plan
 whether or not in pay status
 shall be recalculated to take into account the higher Maximum Benefit payable from the applicable Base Plan. If payments have
already commenced under the provisions of the applicable Base Plan and the Plan
 benefit amounts under both Plans shall be adjusted to reflect the higher 



Maximum Benefit
 by increasing the amount paid under the Base Plan and decreasing the amount paid under the Plan
 as soon as administratively possible after such a change. Notwithstanding the
above
 if a Base Plan is terminated
 no adjustments shall be made to benefits payable under the Plan with respect to changes in the Maximum Benefit after the date of termination of the Base Plan. 
. If the Participant&#146;s benefits under the Plan are includible in income pursuant to Code
section 409A

provided
 that any
Special
Transition Rule During 2005
 After 2005
 the provisions of this Article III shall apply as otherwise applicable. 
. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article III
 for purposes of this
Plan if a Participant is entitled to the special vesting acceleration provided under Sections 4.4 (of Plan A) or 4.7 (of Plan B) of the Separation Pay and Benefits Program for Officers of General Mills
 Inc.
 he or she will be treated as being fully
vested and eligible for a Normal
 Early or Late Retirement under the relevant Base Plan. The determination of whether a retirement is a Normal
 Early or Late Retirement shall be made without regard to any service requirements under the Base Plan.
For purposes of clarity
 Participants entitled to a benefit solely as a result of this Section&nbsp;3.13 shall have the entire amount of their benefit
 including the portion which is below the Maximum Benefit
 paid under this Plan.

 2013 and
 on the date of such Involuntary Termination
 the
Participant has attained age 53 (but not age 55) and completed at least 10 years of Eligibility Service
 the Participant&#146;s benefit under this Plan shall be determined as if the Participant continued to work until and terminated employment upon
attainment of age 55. For this purpose
 the Participant will be credited with additional years of Benefit Service recognizing the period between the date of Involuntary Termination and the date the Participant would attain age 55. All benefits under
this Section&nbsp;3.14(a) will be calculated as though the Participant had attained age 55. In addition
 the Participant&#146;s Earnable Compensation shall be determined as of the date of Involuntary Termination without any further adjustment. In
all events
 the timing of payment of benefits under this Plan shall be governed solely by Section&nbsp;3.8 and no payment shall be made prior to the time a Participant actually attains age 55. 







 2014 and May&nbsp;22
 2015 and
 on the date of such Involuntary Termination
 the Participant has
attained age 53 (but not age 55) and completed at least 10 years of Eligibility Service
 each Participant&#146;s benefit under this Plan shall be determined as if the Participant continued to work until and terminated employment upon attainment of
age 55. For this purpose
 the Participant will be credited with additional years of Benefit Service recognizing the period between the date of Involuntary Termination and the date the Participant would attain age 55. All benefits under this
Section&nbsp;3.14(b) will be calculated as though the Participant had attained age 55. In addition
 the Participant&#146;s Earnable Compensation shall be determined as of the date of Involuntary Termination without any further adjustment. In all
events
 the timing of payment of benefits under this Plan shall be governed solely by Section&nbsp;3.8 and no payment shall be made prior to the time a Participant actually attains age 55. 
. The Plan was created from a spinoff from the Prior Plan and provides for benefit
accruals for services performed prior to the Plan&#146;s Effective Date (such benefits were initially earned under the Prior Plan). On and after the Effective Date
 it is the intent that all benefits previously accrued under the Prior Plan (or any
other predecessor plan) for an individual who is a Participant of this Plan be provided solely under this Plan and none from the Prior Plan. Accordingly
 if any Participant in this Plan has a period of service that is recognized for benefit accrual
purposes under both this Plan and the Prior Plan
 the benefits under this Plan shall be reduced by the value of the Participant&#146;s benefit under the Prior Plan applicable to such service.

the same manner and at the time described in Article III

Plan
 no further benefit accruals shall occur.

accordance with the laws of the United States and the laws of the State applicable to the Base Plan covering the Participant. 


. The Company has established a Supplemental
Benefits Trust with Wells Fargo Bank Minneapolis
 N.A. as Trustee to hold assets of the Company under certain circumstances as a reserve for the discharge of the Company&#146;s obligations under the Plan and certain other plans of deferred
compensation of the Company. In the event of a Change in Control as defined in Section&nbsp;2.3 hereof
 the Company shall be obligated to immediately contribute such amounts to the Trust as may be necessary to fully fund all benefits payable under
the Plan. Any Participant of the Plan shall have the right to demand and secure specific performance of this provision. The Company may fund the Trust in the event of the occurrence of a potential Change in Control as determined by the Finance
Committee of the Board. All assets held in the Trust remain subject only to the claims of the Company&#146;s general creditors whose claims against the Company are not satisfied because of the Company&#146;s bankruptcy or insolvency (as those terms
are defined in the Trust Agreement). No Participant has any preferred claim on
 or beneficial ownership interest in
 any assets of the Trust before the assets are paid to the Participant and all rights created under the Trust

 we have not completed our accounting for&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font style='font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;' &gt; the tax effects of the TCJA.  During fiscal 2018

 we have not recognized a deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of approximately $2.4 billion from our foreign operations because we currently believe our subsidiaries have invested or will invest the &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font style='font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;' &gt;undistributed earnings indefinitely
 or the earnings will be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction. Deferred taxes are recorded for earnings of our foreign operations when we determine that such earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested.  As a result &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font style='font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;' &gt;of the TCJA
 we are re-evaluating our assertion regarding the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings for most legal entities owned directly by our U.S. subsidiaries

 we may need to accrue additional deferred taxes related to any future ch&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font style='font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;' &gt;anges in our assertion. As of May 27

 we believe that these instruments are effective in achieving our objective of providing certainty in the future pri&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font style='font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;' &gt;ce of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. Accordingly
 for purposes of measuring segment operating performance these gains and losses are reported in unallocated corporate items outside of segment operating results until such time that the e&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font style='font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;' &gt;xposure we are managing affects earnings. At that time we reclassify the gain or loss from unallocated corporate items to segment operating profit

Accumulated gain (loss) on foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Includes foreign currency transactions designated as hedges of net investment in a foreign entity and intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term nature
 when the entities to the transaction are consolidated
 combined
 or accounted for by the equity method in the reporting enterprise's financial statements. Includes the gain or loss on a derivative instrument or nonderivative financial instrument that may give rise to a foreign currency transaction gain or loss under FAS 52 and that have been designated and have qualified as hedging instruments for hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation.
















































































































































This item represents the difference between the gross realized gains and losses realized on the sale of debt or equity securities categorized neither as held-to-maturity nor trading securities. Additionally
 this item would include any losses recognized for other than temporary impairments (OTTI) of the subject investments in debt and equity securities.




























Maximum amount of loss due to credit risk that
 based on the gross fair value of the financial instrument
 the entity would incur if parties to the financial instruments that make up the concentration failed completely to perform according to the terms of the contracts and the collateral or other security
 if any
 for the amount due proved to be of no value to the entity.




























Contractual interest rate for funds borrowed
 under the debt agreement.




























Date when the debt instrument is scheduled to be fully repaid
 in CCYY-MM-DD format.




























Period of time between issuance and maturity of debt instrument
 in PnYnMnDTnHnMnS' format
 for example
 'P1Y5M13D' represents the reported fact of one year
 five months
 and thirteen days.


















































































































Date the derivative contract matures
 in CCYY-MM-DD format.




























The aggregate fair value amounts of derivative instruments that contain credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position at the end of the reporting period. For nonderivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments
 the fair value amounts are the carrying value of the nonderivative hedging instrument
 including the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain (loss) on that instrument.





































































































































































































































Maximum period of time the entity is hedging its exposure to variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions
 in 'PnYnMnDTnHnMnS' format
 for example
 'P1Y5M13D' represents the reported fact of one year
 five months
 and thirteen days. Excludes forecasted transactions related to payment of variable interest on existing financial instruments.

























































The net cash outflow or inflow for a financial contract that meets the hedge criteria as either cash flow hedge
 fair value hedge or hedge of net investment in foreign operations.
























































The cash inflow from a debt initially having maturity due after one year or beyond the operating cycle
 if longer.

 which requires us to make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility
 employee exercise behavior
 dividend yield
 and the forfeiture rate. We estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option
 excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility. We also have considered
 but did not use
 implied volatility in our estimate
 because trading activity in options on our stock
 especially those with tenors of greater than 6 months
 is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility.







Share-based Compensation
 Allocation and Classification in Financial Statements [Abstract]

















Unrecognized compensation expense on non-vested awards
 weighted average period of recognition










































































































































Represents the expense recognized during the period arising from equity-based compensation arrangements (for example
 shares of stock
 unit
 stock options or other equity instruments) with employees
 directors and certain consultants qualifying for treatment as emmployees
 including any applicable restructuring items and non-cash items.




























Period over which the company must achieve target performance goals in order for an employee to receive an equity-based payment award
 in 'PnYnMnDTnHnMnS' format
 for example
 'P1Y5M13D' represents the reported fact of one year
 five months
 and thirteen days.






















































































Weighted average period over which unrecognized compensation is expected to be recognized for equity-based compensation plans
 in 'PnYnMnDTnHnMnS' format
 for example
 'P1Y5M13D' represents the reported fact of one year
 five months
 and thirteen days.
























































Period which an employee's right to exercise an award is no longer contingent on satisfaction of either a service condition
 market condition or a performance condition
 in 'PnYnMnDTnHnMnS' format
 for example
 'P1Y5M13D' represents the reported fact of one year
 five months
 and thirteen days.




























Fair value of share-based awards for which the grantee gained the right by satisfying service and performance requirements
 to receive or retain shares or units
 other instruments
 or cash.




























For each plan
 identification of the award pricing model or other valuation method used in calculating the weighted average fair values disclosed. The model is also used to calculate the compensation expense that is shown within the balance sheet
 income statement
 and cash flow. Examples of valuation techniques are lattice models (binomial model)
 closed-form models (Black-Scholes-Merton formula)
 and a Monte Carlo simulation technique. Fair value is the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or incurred or sold or settled in a current transaction between willing parties
 that is
 other than in a forced or liquidation sale. May include disclosures about the assumptions underlying application of the method selected.

























































The difference between the maximum number of shares (or other type of equity) authorized for issuance under the plan (including the effects of amendments and adjustments)
 and the sum of: 1) the number of shares (or other type of equity) already issued upon exercise of options or other equity-based awards under the plan; and 2) shares (or other type of equity) reserved for issuance on granting of outstanding awards
 net of cancellations and forfeitures
 if applicable.




























Period from grant date that an equity-based award expires
 in 'PnYnMnDTnHnMnS' format
 for example
 'P1Y5M13D' represents the reported fact of one year
 five months
 and thirteen days.

The estimated measure of the percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends
 if any
 over the period.
