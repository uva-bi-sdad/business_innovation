PART
I

ITEM
1. BUSINESS



We
are a Cayman Islands exempted company incorporated on July 29
 2016 for the purpose of entering into a merger
 share exchange
asset acquisition
 share purchase
 recapitalization
 reorganization or similar business combination with one or more target businesses
which we refer to through this report as our initial business combination. We have not selected any specific business combination
target
 have generated no operating revenues to date and will not generate operating revenues until we consummate our initial
business combination.

Since
our initial public offering
 we have concentrated our efforts on identifying a prospective target business in the Americas. While
we have explored target businesses throughout the Americas that our management team finds attractive
 our management teams most
extensive experience is with companies in Latin America. Our geographic target also includes North America
 which historically
has maintained close trade and financial links to Latin America
 and which continues to show strong economic performance. We believe
that our management team&rsquo;s successful experiences with Andina I and Andina II
 as well as the composition of our team including
our underwriters
 positions us well to target companies across the Americas.

Opportunities
in Latin America

Within
Latin America
 we have focused on the countries with stable political and macro-economic frameworks which include: Brazil
 Chile
Colombia
 Mexico and Peru. We have and intend to continue to capitalize on opportunities presented by high growth rates within
these countries.

Local
capital markets have been maturing in tandem with the stabilization of domestic economic conditions
 but still lack the depth
and liquidity seen in developed markets. While Latin American capital markets have matured in recent years
 regulatory hurdles
and the still-limited size of the local stock exchanges limit the ability of local companies to gain access to the public equity
capital markets. We believe this creates opportunities for us to connect attractive and growing companies in Latin America with
U.S. based capital markets investors.

Notwithstanding
the foregoing
 many of the countries in this area are still in the development stage and are maturing. This often results in challenges
for management teams in areas such as reconciling financial reporting standards to those of more established countries. Additional
challenges to doing business in these countries include potential changes to tax codes
 bureaucratic inefficiencies and idiosyncratic
judicial systems. These challenges may negatively impact a target business&rsquo; operations or profitability more than if we
acquired a target business in a more established jurisdiction.



Brazil
is the largest economy in South America with a nominal GDP of around $1.9 trillion and is home to a large number of mature and
sophisticated companies across a variety of sectors including agriculture
 mining
 manufacturing and services that are expanding
their international presence. Moreover
 interest rate differentials in Brazil are very high making foreign sources of capital
attractive to local companies.

We
believe companies in Brazil will benefit from the country emerging from a deep recession that took place between 2015 and 2017
buoyed by an ambitious reform agenda and much improved fundamentals. A flexible FX rate policy has also left the Brazilian currency
at more attractive levels for foreign investors. Meanwhile
 international reserves at $365 billion are above recommended adequacy
levels and provide a meaningful buffer against external shocks.



Chile
has long been considered one of the most stable and best managed economies in Latin America. In fact
 the country has held investment
grade status since 1992 offering a low risk-high return profile for foreign investors.

Chile
is a member of the Rio Group
 a full member of APEC
 a founding member of UNASUR
 and the only South American country member of
the OECD. The Chilean government has continuously sought to expand global commercial ties
 as evidenced by the 60 bilateral free
trade agreements the country has signed with Europe
 China
 and the United States
 among others.



Colombia
is the fourth largest economy in Latin America
 with a nominal GDP of $343 billion and a population of 50 million.


    
    


The
economy is in the middle of a recovery and growth forecasts point to a return to potential GDP of approximately 4%
 above the
regional average. Moreover
 the sources of growth are shifting away from mining due to the government&rsquo;s launch of a comprehensive
infrastructure investment program as well as the resilience of domestic consumption. This increases the appeal of a larger range
of sectors for foreign investors. We also maintain that valuations remain very compelling for foreign investors looking to increase
exposure to the country.



According
to the International Monetary Fund
 per-capita income has grown approximately 50% in the last decade
 allowing a significant reduction
in poverty &mdash; from 59% in 2004 to 20% in 2018. While the country has benefited from high commodities prices
 particularly
for copper and gold
 we believe that the multi-year trend of economic expansion has been made possible by prudent macroeconomic
and monetary policies. Inflation has remained low
 the fiscal position has strengthened
 dollarization rates have dropped drastically
and financial stability has been maintained.

Peru
was granted investment grade by the three leading rating agencies between 2008 and 2009
 reflecting these structural and social
achievements.

Strong
growth prospects
 exemplary economic management
 and exposure to rising commodity prices have made Peru a favored destination
for foreign investors.



Mexico
offers a large ($1.3 trillion) free market economy
 with one of the highest private sector participation in the region
 and a
mix of modern and traditional industry. Economic management is undermined by very strong policies and institutional policy framework.

Recent
governments have prioritized wide-spreading structural economic and competitiveness reforms enhancing the country&rsquo;s medium
term potential growth. In the current cycle
 the Mexican economy has shown resilience to a complex external environment. GDP is
expected to expand 2-3% in the coming years
 above the US economy
 with private consumption as the main driver of activity and
supported by manufacturing exports.

Finally
Mexico&rsquo;s economy is the most open in South America. The country has free trade agreements with over 50 countries with almost
90% of its trade flow covered by free trade agreements.

Competitive
Advantages

We
believe we have the following competitive advantages:


Status
We believe our structure will make us an attractive business
                                         combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company
 we offer a target
                                         business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or
                                         other business combination. In this situation
 the owners of the target business would
                                         exchange their shares in the target business for our shares or for a combination of shares
                                         and cash
 allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers.
                                         We believe target businesses might find this method a more certain and cost effective
                                         method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical
                                         initial public offering
 there are additional expenses incurred in marketing
 roadshow
                                         and public reporting efforts that will likely not be present to the same extent in connection
                                         with a business combination with us. Furthermore
 once the business combination is consummated
                                         the target business will have effectively become public
 whereas an initial public offering
                                         is always subject to the underwriters&rsquo; ability to complete the offering as well
                                         as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public
                                         we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional
                                         means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders&rsquo; interests
                                         than it would have as a privately-held company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting
                                         a company&rsquo;s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting
                                         talented employees.

While
we believe that our status as a public company will make us an attractive business partner
 some potential target businesses may
view the inherent limitations in our status as a blank check company as a deterrent and may prefer to effect a business combination
with a more established entity or with a private company. These inherent limitations include limitations on our available financial
resources
 which may be inferior to those of other entities pursuing the acquisition of similar target businesses; the requirement
that we offer shareholders the right to seek conversion of their shares in connection with a proposed business combination by
either a proxy statement or tender offer
 which may delay the consummation of a transaction; and the existence of our outstanding
rights and warrants
 which may represent a source of future dilution.


Financial
With a trust account currently (as of December 31
 2019) in the amount
                                         of approximately $110
149
000 and a public market for our ordinary shares
 we
                                         offer a target business a variety of options such as providing the owners of a target
                                         business with shares in a public company and a public means to sell such shares
 providing
                                         cash for stock
 and providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations
                                         or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to
                                         consummate our initial business combination using our cash
 debt or equity securities
                                         or a combination of the foregoing
 we have the flexibility to use the most efficient
                                         combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business
                                         to fit its needs and desires. However
 we have not taken any steps to secure third party
                                         financing and it may not be available to us.


    
    



Management
 We believe that our executive officers possess
                                         the experience
 skills and contacts necessary to source
 evaluate
 and execute an attractive
                                         business combination. Several of our officers and directors were previously officers
                                         directors or advisors and consultants to Andina I
 Andina II and MI Acquisitions Inc.
                                         three similar blank check companies that successfully consummated business combinations.
                                         We have and intend to continue to leverage the contacts and relationships of our executive
                                         officers and directors to source
 evaluate and execute business combination opportunities.

Effecting
a Business Combination



We
are not presently engaged in
 and we will not engage in
 any substantive commercial business until we consummate our initial business
combination. We have and intend to continue to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private
placement of private units
 our share capital
 debt or a combination of these in effecting a business combination. Although substantially
all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of private units are intended to be applied generally
toward effecting a business combination as described in this prospectus
 the proceeds are not otherwise being designated for any
more specific purposes. Accordingly
 investors in our initial public offering are investing without first having an opportunity
to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any one or more business combinations. A business combination may involve the acquisition
of
 or merger with
 a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading
market for its shares
 while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These
include time delays
 significant expense
 loss of voting control and compliance with various Federal and state securities laws.
In the alternative
 we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its
early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target
business
 we will probably have the ability
 as a result of our limited resources
 to effect only a single business combination.

Selection
of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination

Subject
to our officers&rsquo; and directors&rsquo; existing fiduciary duties and the Nasdaq rules that require that a target business
have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement
for our initial business combination
 as described below in more detail
 our management has virtually unrestricted flexibility
in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. We have not established any other specific attributes or criteria
(financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. In evaluating a prospective target business
 our management has and
will continue to consider a variety of factors
 including one or more of the following:



    
    
financial condition
    and results of operation;




    
    
    




    
    
experience and skill
    of management and availability of additional personnel;




    
    
    




    
    
    




    
    
    




    
    
stage of development
    of its products
 processes or services;




    
    
degree of current
    or potential market acceptance of the products
 processes or services;




    
    
proprietary features
    and degree of intellectual property or other protection for its products
 processes or services;




    
    
regulatory environment
    of the industry; and




    
    
costs associated
    with effecting the business combination.


We
believe such factors are important in evaluating prospective target businesses
 regardless of the location or industry in which
such target business operates. However
 this list is not intended to be exhaustive. Furthermore
 we may decide to enter into a
business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines.

Any
evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination is based
 to the extent relevant
 on the above factors
as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business
objective. In evaluating a prospective target business
 we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass
among other things
 meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities
 as well as review of financial and other
information which is made available to us. This due diligence review has been and will continue to be conducted either by our
management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage
 although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.


    
    


The
time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot
presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of
a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce
the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.

Fair
Market Value of Target Business

Pursuant
to Nasdaq listing rules
 the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to
at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial
business combination
 although we may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust
account balance. We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets
of the target business or businesses. We may
 however
 structure a business combination where we merge directly with the target
business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives
of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons
 but we will only complete such business combination if the
post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires
a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target
 our shareholders
prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company
 depending on valuations
ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example
 we could pursue a transaction in which we
issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital of a target. In this case
 we could acquire
a 100% controlling interest in the target. However
 as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares
 our shareholders
immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our
initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned
or acquired by the post-transaction company
 only the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what
will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. In order to consummate such an acquisition
 we may issue a significant
amount of our debt or equity securities to the sellers of such businesses and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private
offering of debt or equity securities. Since we have no specific business combination under consideration
 we have not entered
into any such fund raising arrangement and have no current intention of doing so. The fair market value of the target will be
determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual
and potential sales
 earnings
 cash flow and/or book value). If our board is not able to independently determine that the target
business has a sufficient fair market value (for instance
 if our board is not thoroughly familiar with the industry in which
the target business we are seeking to acquire operates or if the assets of the target business we are seeking to acquire are difficult
to evaluate from a financial standpoint)
 we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated
 independent investment banking firm
or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions
 with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We
will not be required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm
 or another independent entity that commonly
renders valuation opinions
 as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business
complies with the 80% threshold.

If
Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange
 we would not be required to satisfy the fair market value requirement
described above and could complete a business combination with a target business having a fair market value substantially below
80% of the balance in the trust account.

Lack
of Business Diversification

Our
business combination must be with a target business or businesses that collectively satisfy the minimum valuation standard at
the time of such acquisition
 as discussed above
 although this process may entail the simultaneous acquisitions of several operating
businesses at the same time. Therefore
 at least initially
 the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future
performance of a single business. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations
of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry
 it is probable that we will not have the
resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating
a business combination with only a single entity
 our lack of diversification may:



    
    
subject
    us to numerous economic
 competitive and regulatory developments
 any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact
    upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination
 and

    
    
    

    
    
result in our dependency
    upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number
    of products
 processes or services.


If
we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers
 we will need for
each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions
which may make it more difficult for us
 and delay our ability
 to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions
we could also face additional risks
 including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and
due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation
of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business.


    
    


Limited
Ability to Evaluate the Target Business&rsquo; Management

Although
we have and intend to continue to scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability
of effecting a business combination
 there can be no assurances that our assessment of the target business&rsquo; management will
prove to be correct. In addition
 there can be no assurances that the future management will have the necessary skills
 qualifications
or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore
 the future role of our officers and directors
 if any
 in the target business
following a business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel
will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following a business combination
 it is unlikely that
they will devote their full time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover
 they would only be able
to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting
agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation
of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities
for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial
interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business
 their ability to
remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as
to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally
 our officers and directors may not have
significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.

Following
a business combination
 we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business.
There can be no assurances that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers
 or that any such additional managers
we do recruit will have the requisite skills
 knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

Shareholders
May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination

In
connection with any proposed business combination
 we will either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination
at a meeting called for such purpose at which public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares
 regardless of whether
they vote for or against the proposed business combination
 into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit
in the trust account (net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to sell their public shares
to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share
of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable)
 in each case subject to the limitations described
herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 our initial shareholders have agreed
 pursuant to written letter agreements with us
 not
to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account.
If we determine to engage in a tender offer
 such tender offer will be structured so that each shareholder may tender any or all
of his
 her or its public shares rather than some pro rata portion of his
 her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will
seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender
offer will be made by us based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction
 whether the terms of the transaction
would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would
require us to conduct a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Unlike other blank check companies
which require shareholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and related
conversions of public shares for cash upon consummation of such initial business combination even when a vote is not required
by law
 we will have the flexibility to avoid such shareholder vote and allow our shareholders to sell their shares pursuant to
Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case
 we will file tender offer
documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination
as is required under the SEC&rsquo;s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible
assets of at least $5
000
001 upon such consummation and
 solely if we seek shareholder approval
 a majority of the issued and
outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination.

We
chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5
000
001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under
the Securities Act. However
 if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any
type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon
consummation of such initial business combination
 our net tangible asset threshold may limit our ability to consummate such initial
business combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of shares converted or sold to us) and may force us to seek
third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result
 we may not be able to consummate
such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period
if at all. Public shareholders may therefore have to wait until after July 31
 2020 in order to be able to receive a pro rata
share of the trust account.

Our
initial shareholders and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any ordinary shares owned by them in favor of any
proposed business combination
 (2) not to convert any ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed
initial business combination and (3) not sell any ordinary shares in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business
combination. The purchasers of the private units have also agreed to vote their private shares in favor of any proposed business
combination. As a result
 if we sought shareholder approval of a proposed transaction
 we would need only 3
852
501 (or approximately
35.7%) of the 10
800
000 public shares sold in our initial public offering to be voted in favor of the transaction in order to
have such transaction approved (assuming all outstanding shares voted).


    
    


Conversion/Tender
Rights

At
any meeting called to approve an initial business combination
 public shareholders (but not our initial shareholders) may seek
to convert their public shares
 regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination
 into their pro
rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account
 less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Notwithstanding
the foregoing
 our initial shareholders have agreed
 pursuant to written letter agreements with us
 not to convert any public
shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. The conversion rights
will be effected under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and Cayman Islands law as a compulsory
redemption. If we hold a meeting to approve an initial business combination
 a holder will always have the ability to vote against
a proposed business combination and not seek conversion of his shares.

Alternatively
if we engage in a tender offer
 each public shareholder will be provided the opportunity to sell his public shares to us in such
tender offer. The tender offer rules require us to hold the tender offer open for at least 20 business days. Accordingly
 this
is the minimum amount of time we would need to provide holders to determine whether they want to sell their public shares to us
in the tender offer or remain an investor in our company.

Our
initial shareholders
 officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any ordinary shares owned by them
directly or indirectly
 whether acquired prior to our initial public offering or purchased by them in initial public offering
or in the aftermarket. Additionally
 the purchasers of the private units will not have conversion rights with respect to any private
shares.

We
may also require public shareholders
 whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in &ldquo;street name
&rdquo; to either
tender their certificates to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository
Trust Company&rsquo;s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System
 at the holder&rsquo;s option
 at any time at or prior to
the vote on the business combination. Once the shares are converted by the beneficial holder
 and effectively repurchased or redeemed
by us under Cayman Island law
 the transfer agent will then update our Register of Shareholders to reflect all conversions. The
proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to shareholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination
will indicate whether we are requiring shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly
 a shareholder would have
from the time our proxy statement is mailed through the vote on the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to
seek to exercise his conversion rights. Under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
 we are required
to provide at least 10 days&rsquo; advance notice of any shareholder meeting
 which would be the minimum amount of time a shareholder
would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights. As a result
 if we require public shareholders who wish to convert
their ordinary shares into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account to comply with the foregoing
delivery requirements
 holders may not have sufficient time to receive the notice and deliver their shares for conversion. Accordingly
investors may not be able to exercise their conversion rights and may be forced to retain our securities when they otherwise would
not want to.

There
is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the
DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $100 and it would be up to the broker whether or not
to pass this cost on to the converting holder. However
 this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders
seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless
of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However
 in the event we require shareholders seeking to exercise conversion
rights to deliver their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination
is not consummated
 this may result in an increased cost to shareholders.

Any
request to convert or tender such shares once made
 may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination
or expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore
 if a holder of a public share delivered his certificate in connection with an
election of their conversion or tender and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the business combination or the expiration
of the tender offer not to elect to exercise such rights
 he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate
(physically or electronically).

If
the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason
 then our public shareholders who elected to exercise
their conversion or tender rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust
account. In such case
 we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.

Limitation
on Conversion Rights

Notwithstanding
the foregoing conversion rights
 if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not offer conversion
in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules
 our amended and restated memorandum and
articles of association will provide that a public shareholder
 together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person
with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a &ldquo;group&rdquo; (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act)
will be restricted from seeking conversion of its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in initial
public offering
 without our prior consent. We believe the restriction described above will discourage shareholders from accumulating
large blocks of shares
 and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to convert their shares as a means to force
us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable
terms. Absent this provision
 a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in initial public
offering could threaten to exercise its conversion rights against an initial business combination if such holder&rsquo;s shares
are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting
our shareholders&rsquo; ability to convert no more than 15% of the shares sold in initial public offering
 we believe we will
limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business
combination
 particularly in connection with an initial business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition
that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However
 we would not be restricting our shareholders&rsquo; ability
to vote all of their shares (including all shares held by those shareholders that hold more than 15% of the shares sold in initial
public offering) for or against our initial business combination.


    
    


Redemption
of Public Shares if No Business Combination

If
we do not complete a business combination by July 31
 2020
 we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding
up
 (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter
 redeem 100% of the outstanding public
shares
 at a per-share price
 payable in cash
 equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account
 including any
interest earned on the funds held in the trust account not previously released to us to pay our tax obligations and less up to
$100
000 of interest we may use for our working capital obligations
 including any necessary liquidation or dissolution expenses
divided by the number of then outstanding public shares
 which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders&rsquo;
rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions
 if any)
 subject to applicable law
and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption
 subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders
and our board of directors
 liquidate and dissolve
 subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Cayman
Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

Prior
to such redemption of public shares
 we would be required to assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us by our
creditors for amounts they are actually owed and make provision for such amounts
 as creditors take priority over our public shareholders
with respect to amounts that are owed to them. There can be no assurances that we will properly assess all claims that may be
potentially brought against us. As such
 our shareholders could potentially be liable for any claims of creditors to the extent
of distributions received by them as an unlawful payment in the event we enter an insolvent liquidation. Furthermore
 while we
will seek to have all vendors and service providers (which would include any third parties we engaged to assist us in any way
in connection with our search for a target business) and prospective target businesses execute agreements with us waiving any
right
 title
 interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account
 there is no guarantee
that they will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that
 even if such entities execute such agreements with us
they will not seek recourse against the trust account or that a court would conclude that such agreements are legally enforceable.

Each
of our initial shareholders and the purchasers of the private units have agreed to waive its rights to participate in any liquidation
of our trust account with respect to the insider shares
 private shares and private warrants. There will be no distribution from
the trust account with respect to our rights or warrants which will expire worthless.

If
we are unable to complete an initial business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering
 other
than the proceeds deposited in the trust account
 and without taking into account interest
 if any
 earned on the trust account
the initial per-share distribution from the trust account would be approximately $10.20 (based on the trust account balance as
of December 31
 2019).

The
proceeds deposited in the trust account could
 however
 become subject to the claims of our creditors which would be prior to
the claims of our public shareholders. Although we will seek to have all vendors
 including lenders for money borrowed
 prospective
target businesses or other entities we engage execute agreements with us waiving any right
 title
 interest or claim of any kind
in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders
 there is no guarantee that they will
execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the
trust account
 including but not limited to
 fraudulent inducement
 breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims
as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver
 in each case in order to gain an advantage with a claim against
our assets
 including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refused to execute an agreement waiving such claims
to the monies held in the trust account
 we would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to us if we chose not to engage
such third party and evaluate if such engagement would be in the best interest of our shareholders if such third party refused
to waive such claims. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refused to execute a waiver include
the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly
superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a provider
of required services willing to provide the waiver. In any event
 our management would perform an analysis of the alternatives
available to it and would only enter into an agreement with a third party that did not execute a waiver if management believed
that such third party&rsquo;s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. In addition
 there
is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of
 or arising out of
any negotiations
 contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason.

B.
Luke Weil has agreed that
 if we liquidate the trust account prior to the consummation of a business combination
 he will be personally
liable to pay debts and obligations to target businesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered
or contracted for or products sold to us in excess of the net proceeds of our initial public offering not held in the trust account
but only to the extent necessary to ensure that such debts or obligations do not reduce the amounts in the trust account and only
if such parties have not executed a waiver agreement. However
 there can be no assurances that he will be able to satisfy those
obligations if he is required to do so. Accordingly
 the actual per-share distribution could be less than $10.20 (based on the
trust account balance as of December 31
 2019) due to claims of creditors. Additionally
 if we are forced to file a bankruptcy
case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed
 the proceeds held in the trust account could
be subject to applicable bankruptcy law
 and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties
with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account
 there can be
no assurances that we will be able to return to our public shareholders at least $10.20 (based on the trust account balance as
of December 31
 2019).


    
    




In
identifying
 evaluating and selecting a target business
 we have encountered and may continue to encounter intense competition
from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive
experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater
technical
 human and other resources than us and our financial resources is relatively limited when contrasted with those of many
of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds
of our initial public offering
 our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available
financial resources.



We
have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and devote
only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs and intend to continue doing so until we have completed our initial business
combination. The amount of time they devote in any time period may vary based on whether a target business has been selected
for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly
 once management
locates a suitable target business to acquire
 they may spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and
processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time to our affairs) than they would prior to locating a suitable
target business.

Periodic
Reporting and Audited Financial Statements

We
have registered our units
 ordinary shares
 rights and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations
 including
the requirement that we file annual
 quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange
Act
 our annual report will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.

We
will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation
sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood
 the financial information included in
the proxy solicitation materials will need to be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS
 depending on the circumstances
and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. The financial
statements are also required to be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the Form 8-K announcing the closing of an initial
business combination
 which would need to be filed within four business days thereafter. There can be no assurances that any particular
target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial information. To the extent
that this requirement cannot be met
 we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.

We
may be required to have our internal control procedures audited for the fiscal year ending December 31
 2020 as required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy
of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.

We
are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act and will remain such for up to five years. We will remain an emerging
growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion
of our initial public offering
 (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion
 or (c) in which we
are deemed to be a large accelerated filer
 which means the market value of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares that are
held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30
 and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion
in non-convertible debt during the prior three year period. As an emerging growth company
 we have elected
 under Section 107(b)
of the JOBS Act.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS

Risks
Associated with Our Business

We
have a limited operating history and
 accordingly
 our public shareholders have little basis on which to evaluate our ability
to achieve our business objective.

We
have limited operating results to date. Since we do not have a significant operating history
 our public shareholders will have
little basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective
 which is to acquire an operating business.
We may not be able to complete our initial business combination. We will not generate any revenues until after the consummation
of a business combination.

If
we are unable to consummate a business combination
 our public shareholders may be forced to wait until after July 31
 2020
before receiving liquidation distributions.

We
have until July 31
 2020 to complete a business combination. We have no obligation to return funds to investors prior to such
date unless we consummate a business combination prior thereto and only then in cases where investors have sought to convert their
shares. Only after the expiration of this full time period will public shareholders be entitled to liquidation distributions if
we are unable to complete a business combination. Accordingly
 our public shareholders funds may be unavailable to them until
after such date and to liquidate their investment
 they may be forced to sell their securities potentially at a loss.


    
    


The
requirement that we complete an initial business combination within a specific period of time may give potential target businesses
leverage over us in negotiating a business transaction.

We
have until July 31
 2020 to complete an initial business combination. Any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations
concerning a business combination will be aware of this requirement. Consequently
 such target business may obtain leverage over
us in negotiating a business combination
 knowing that if we do not complete a business combination with that particular target
business
 we may be unable to complete a business combination with any other target business. This risk will increase as we get
closer to the time limits referenced above.

We
may issue ordinary or preferred shares or debt securities to complete a business combination
 which would reduce the equity interest
of our shareholders and likely cause a change in control of our ownership.

Our
memorandum and articles of association currently authorizes the issuance of up to 100
000
000 ordinary shares
 par value $.0001
per share
 and 1
000
000 preferred shares
 par value $0.0001 per share. Immediately after our initial public offering and the
purchase of the private units
 there were 73
790
500 authorized but unissued ordinary shares available for issuance (after
appropriate reservation for the issuance of the shares underlying the private units
 public and private rights and public and
private warrants). Although we have no commitment as of the date of this report
 we may issue a substantial number of additional
ordinary shares or preferred shares
 or a combination of ordinary shares and preferred shares
 to complete a business combination.
The issuance of additional ordinary shares or preferred shares:

&#9679;
may subordinate the rights of holders of ordinary shares if we issue preferred shares with rights senior to those afforded to
our ordinary shares;

&#9679;
may cause a change in control if a substantial number of ordinary shares are issued
 which may affect
 among other things
 our
ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards
 if any
 and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers
and directors; and

&#9679;
may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our ordinary shares.

Similarly
if we issue debt securities
 it could result in:

&#9679;
default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a business combination are insufficient to repay our debt
obligations;

&#9679;
acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach
certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that
covenant;

&#9679;
our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest
 if any
 if the debt security is payable on demand; and

&#9679;
our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain
such financing while the debt security is outstanding.

We
may be unable to obtain additional financing
 if required
 to complete a business combination or to fund the operations and growth
of the target business
 which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination.

We
cannot ascertain the capital requirements for any particular transaction. If the net proceeds of our initial public offering prove
to be insufficient
 either because of the size of the business combination
 the depletion of the available net proceeds in search
of a target business
 or the obligation to convert into cash (or purchase in any tender offer) a significant number of shares
from shareholders
 we will be required to seek additional financing. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms
if at all. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to consummate a particular business combination
we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative
target business candidate. In addition
 if we consummate a business combination
 we may require additional financing to fund the
operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on
the continued development or growth of the target business. None of our officers
 directors or shareholders is required to provide
any financing to us in connection with or after a business combination.

Holders
of rights and warrants will not have redemption rights.

If
we are unable to complete an initial business combination by July 31
 2020
 the rights and warrants will expire worthless and
holders will not receive any of the liquidating proceeds with respect to such securities.


    
    


We
have no obligation to net cash settle the rights or warrants.

In
no event will we have any obligation to net cash settle the rights or warrants. Accordingly
 the rights and warrants may expire
worthless.

Our
management&rsquo;s ability to require holders of our redeemable warrants to exercise such redeemable warrants on a cashless basis
will cause holders to receive fewer ordinary shares upon their exercise of the redeemable warrants than they would have received
had they been able to exercise their redeemable warrants for cash.

If
we call our warrants for redemption after the redemption criteria described elsewhere in this report have been satisfied
 our
management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise his warrants (including any warrants held by our
initial shareholders or their permitted transferees) to do so on a &ldquo;cashless basis.&rdquo; If our management chooses to
require holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis
 the number of ordinary shares received by a holder upon exercise
will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised his warrants for cash. This will have the effect of reducing the
potential &ldquo;upside&rdquo; of the holder&rsquo;s investment in our company.

We
may amend the terms of the rights in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least a majority
of the then outstanding rights.

Our
rights are issued in registered form under a rights agreement between Continental Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company
 as rights
agent
 and us. The rights agreement provides that the terms of the rights may be amended without the consent of any holder to
cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision. The rights agreement requires the approval by the holders of at least a
majority of the then outstanding rights (including the private rights) in order to make any change that adversely affects the
interests of the registered holders.

We
may amend the terms of the warrants in a way that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of a majority of
the then outstanding warrants.

Our
warrants are issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company
 as warrant
agent
 and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder
to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision. The warrant agreement requires the approval by the holders of a majority
of the then outstanding warrants (including the private warrants) in order to make any change that adversely affects the interests
of the registered holders.

A
provision of our warrant agreement may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination.

Unlike
most blank check companies
 if

&#9679;
we issue additional ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of
our initial business combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $8.50 per share


&#9679;
the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds
 and interest thereon
 available
for the funding of our initial business combination on the date of the consummation of our initial business combination (net of
redemptions)
 and

&#9679;
the Market Value is below $8.50 per share


then
the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted to be equal to 115% of the greater of (i) the Market Value or (ii) the price
at which we issue the additional ordinary shares or equity-linked securities. This may make it more difficult for us to consummate
an initial business combination with a target business.

Since
we have not yet selected a particular industry or target business with which to complete a business combination
 we are unable
to currently ascertain the merits or risks of the industry or business in which we may ultimately operate.

While
we have and intend to continue to focus our search for target businesses on specific locations as described in this report
 we
are not limited to those locations and may consummate a business combination with a company in any location or industry we choose.
Accordingly
 there is no current basis for our public shareholders to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the particular
industry in which we may ultimately operate or the target business which we may ultimately acquire. To the extent we complete
a business combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its development stage
 we may be affected by numerous
risks inherent in the business operations of those entities. If we complete a business combination with an entity in an industry
characterized by a high level of risk
 we may be affected by the currently unascertainable risks of that industry. Although our
management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular industry or target business
 there can be no assurances
that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. There also can be no assurances that an investment
in our units will not ultimately prove to be less favorable to our public shareholders than a direct investment
 if an opportunity
were available
 in a target business.


    
    


The
requirement that the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least
80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business
combination may limit the type and number of companies that we may complete such a business combination with.

Pursuant
to the Nasdaq listing rules
 the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal
to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our
initial business combination. This restriction may limit the type and number of companies with which we may complete a business
combination. If we are unable to locate a target business or businesses that satisfy this fair market value test
 we may be forced
to liquidate and our public shareholders will only be entitled to receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account.

If
Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange
 we would not be required to satisfy the fair market value requirement
described above and could complete a business combination with a target business having a fair market value substantially below
80% of the balance in the trust account.

Our
ability to successfully effect a business combination and to be successful thereafter is totally dependent upon the efforts of
our key personnel
 some of whom may join us following a business combination. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals
we engage after a business combination
 there can be no assurances that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct.

Our
ability to successfully effect a business combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. We believe that our
success depends on the continued service of our key personnel
 at least until we have consummated our initial business combination.
We cannot assure our public shareholders that any of our key personnel will remain with us for the immediate or foreseeable future.
In addition
 none of our officers are required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and
 accordingly
 they will
have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities
 including identifying potential business
combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. We do not have employment agreements with
 or key-man insurance on the
life of
 any of our officers. The unexpected loss of the services of our key personnel could have a detrimental effect on us.

The
role of our key personnel in the target business
 however
 cannot presently be ascertained. Although some of our key personnel
may remain with the target business in senior management or advisory positions following a business combination
 it is likely
that some or all of the management of the target business will remain in place or be hired after consummation of the business
combination. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after a business combination
 there can be no assurances
that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of
operating a public company which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements.
This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect our operations.

Our
officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge regarding the jurisdiction or industry of the target business
we may seek to acquire.

We
may consummate a business combination with a target business in any geographic location or industry we choose. There can be no
assurances that our officers and directors will have enough experience or have sufficient knowledge relating to the jurisdiction
of the target or its industry to make an informed decision regarding a business combination. If we become aware of a potential
business combination outside of the geographic location or industry where our officers and directors have the most experience
our management may retain consultants and advisors with experience in such industries to assist in the evaluation of such business
combination and in our determination of whether or not to proceed with such a business combination. However
 our management is
not required to engage consultants or advisors in any situation. If they do not engage any consultants or advisors to assist them
in the evaluation of a particular target business or business combination
 our management may not properly analyze the risks attendant
with such target business or business combination. Even if our management does engage consultants or advisors to assist in the
evaluation of a particular target business or business combination
 there can be no assurances that such consultants or advisors
will properly analyze the risks attendant with such target business or business combination. As a result
 we may enter into a
business combination that is not in our shareholders&rsquo; best interests.

Our
key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business
combination. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following a business combination and as a result
 may
cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous.

Our
key personnel will be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination only if they are able to
negotiate employment or consulting agreements or other arrangements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations
would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive
compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation
of the business combination. The personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying
and selecting a target business.


    
    


Our
officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses thereby potentially limiting the amount of time they devote
to our affairs. This conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate our initial business combination.

Our
officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs
 which could create a conflict of interest when
allocating their time between our operations and their other commitments. We presently expect each of our employees to devote
such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week while
we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we move into serious negotiations with a target
business for a business combination). We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial
business combination. All of our officers and directors are engaged in several other business endeavors and are not obligated
to devote any specific number of hours to our affairs. If our officers&rsquo; and directors&rsquo; other business affairs require
them to devote more substantial amounts of time to such affairs
 it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs and
could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate our initial business combination. There can be no assurances that conflicts
will be resolved in our favor.

Our
officers and directors have pre-existing fiduciary and contractual obligations and accordingly
 may have conflicts of interest
in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.

Our
officers and directors have pre-existing fiduciary and contractual obligations to other companies that are engaged in business
activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us. Accordingly
 they may participate in transactions and have obligations
that may be in conflict or competition with our consummation of our initial business combination
 subject to his or her fiduciary
duties under Cayman Islands law. As a result
 a potential target business may be presented by our management team to another entity
prior to its presentation to us and we may not be afforded the opportunity to engage in a transaction with such target business.

Our
officers&rsquo; and directors&rsquo; personal and financial interests may influence their motivation in determining whether a
particular target business is appropriate for a business combination.

Our
officers and directors have waived their right to convert (or sell to us in any tender offer) their insider shares
 private shares
or any other ordinary shares acquired in our initial public offering or thereafter
 or to receive distributions from the trust
account with respect to their insider shares or private shares upon our liquidation if we are unable to consummate our initial
business combination.

Accordingly
these securities will be worthless if we do not consummate our initial business combination. The private warrants and any other
warrants they acquire will also be worthless if we do not consummate an initial business combination. In addition
 our officers
and directors may loan funds to us after our initial public offering and may be owed reimbursement for expenses incurred in connection
with certain activities on our behalf which would only be repaid if we complete an initial business combination. The personal
and financial interests of our directors and officers may influence their motivation in timely identifying and selecting a target
business and completing a business combination.

Consequently
our directors&rsquo; and officers&rsquo; discretion in identifying and selecting a suitable target business may result in a conflict
of interest when determining whether the terms
 conditions and timing of a particular business combination are appropriate and
in our shareholders&rsquo; best interest. If this were the case
 it would be a breach of their fiduciary duties to us as a matter
of Cayman Islands law and we might have a claim against such individuals. However
 we might not ultimately be successful in any
claim we may make against them for such reason.

Nasdaq
may delist our securities from trading on its exchange which could limit investors&rsquo; ability to make transactions in our
securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.

Our
securities are currently listed on the Nasdaq. There can be no assurances that our securities will continue to be listed on Nasdaq
in the future prior to an initial business combination. Additionally
 in connection with our initial business combination
 it
is likely that Nasdaq will require us to file a new initial listing application and meet its initial listing requirements as opposed
to its more lenient continued listing requirements. There can be no assurances that we will be able to meet those initial listing
requirements at that time.

If
Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange
 we could face significant material adverse consequences
 including:

&#9679;
a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;

&#9679;
reduced liquidity with respect to our securities;

&#9679;
a determination that our ordinary shares are &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; which will require brokers trading in our ordinary shares
to adhere to more stringent rules
 possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for
our ordinary shares;

&#9679;
a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and

&#9679;
a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.

The
National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996
 which is a federal statute
 prevents or preempts the states from regulating
the sale of certain securities
 which are referred to as &ldquo;covered securities.&rdquo; Because our units and eventually our
ordinary shares
 rights and warrants will be listed on Nasdaq
 our units
 ordinary shares
 rights and warrants will be covered
securities. If we were no longer listed on Nasdaq
 our securities would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation
in each state in which we offer our securities.


    
    


We
may only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of our initial public offering
 which will cause us to
be solely dependent on a single business which may have a limited number of products or services.

We
may only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of our initial public offering. By consummating a business
combination with only a single entity
 our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic
 competitive and regulatory
developments. Further
 we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting
of losses
 unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries
or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly
 the prospects for our success may be:



    
    
solely dependent upon the performance of a single business
or

    
    
    

    
    
dependent upon the development or market acceptance
of a single or limited number of products
 processes or services.


This
lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic
 competitive and regulatory developments
 any or all of which may
have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination.

Alternatively
if we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers
 we will need
for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other business
combinations
 which may make it more difficult for us
 and delay our ability
 to complete the business combination. With multiple
business combinations
 we could also face additional risks
 including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple
negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent
assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. If we are unable
to adequately address these risks
 it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations.

The
ability of our public shareholders to exercise their conversion rights or sell their public shares to us in a tender offer may
not allow us to effectuate the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.

If
our business combination requires us to use substantially all of our cash to pay the purchase price
 because we will not know
how many public shareholders may exercise conversion rights or seek to sell their public shares to us in a tender offer
 we may
either need to reserve part of the trust account for possible payment upon such conversion
 or we may need to arrange third party
financing to help fund our business transaction. In the event that the business combination involves the issuance of our shares
as consideration
 we may be required to issue a higher percentage of our shares to make up for a shortfall in funds. Raising additional
funds to cover any shortfall may involve dilutive equity financing or incurring indebtedness at higher than desirable levels.
This may limit our ability to effectuate the most attractive business combination available to us.

The
ability of our public shareholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential
business combination targets
 which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target.

We
may seek to enter into a business combination transaction agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition
that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights
we would not be able to meet such closing condition and
 as a result
 would not be able to proceed with the business combination.
Furthermore
 we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least
$5
000
001 either prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination
 after payment of the deferred underwriting
commission (so that we are not subject to the SEC&rsquo;s &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules) or any greater net tangible asset or
cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. Consequently
 if accepting
all properly submitted redemption requests would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5
000
001 either prior to or upon
consummation of our initial business combination or such greater amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described
above
 we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate
business combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these risks and
 thus
 may be reluctant to enter into a business combination
transaction with us.

Our
public shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed business combination
 which means we may consummate
our initial business combination even though a majority of our public shareholders do not support such a combination.

We
intend to hold a shareholder vote before we consummate our initial business combination. However
 if a shareholder vote is not
required
 for business or legal reasons
 we may conduct conversions via a tender offer and not offer our shareholders the opportunity
to vote on a proposed business combination. Accordingly
 we may consummate our initial business combination even if holders of
a majority of our public shares do not approve of the business combination.


    
    


In
connection with any meeting held to approve an initial business combination
 we will offer each public shareholder the option
to vote in favor of a proposed business combination and still seek conversion of his
 her or its public shares
 which may make
it more likely that we will consummate a business combination.

In
connection with any meeting held to approve an initial business combination
 we will offer each public shareholder (but not our
initial shareholders) the right to have his
 her or its public shares converted to cash (subject to the limitations described
elsewhere in this report) regardless of whether such shareholder votes for or against such proposed business combination. Furthermore
we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5
000
001 upon such consummation
and a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. Accordingly
 our public shareholders
may exercise their conversion rights and we could still consummate a proposed business combination so long as a majority of shares
voted at the meeting are voted in favor of the proposed business combination. This is different than other similarly structured
blank check companies where shareholders are offered the right to convert their shares only when they vote against a proposed
business combination. This is also different than other similarly structured blank check companies where there is a specific number
of shares sold in the offering which must not exercise conversion rights for the company to complete a business combination. The
lack of such a threshold and the ability to seek conversion while voting in favor of a proposed business combination may make
it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination.

In
connection with any shareholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination
 we may require shareholders
who wish to convert their public shares to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for
them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights.

In
connection with any shareholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination
 each public shareholder will
have the right
 regardless of whether it is voting for or against such proposed business combination
 to demand that we convert
its public shares into a share of the trust account. Such conversion will be effectuated under Cayman Islands law as a redemption
of the shares
 with the redemption price to be paid being the applicable pro rata portion of the monies held in the trust account.
We may require public shareholders who wish to convert their public shares in connection with a proposed business combination
to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using
the Depository Trust Company&rsquo;s (&ldquo;DTC&rdquo;) DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System
 at the holder&rsquo;s
option
 at any time at or prior to the vote taken at the shareholder meeting relating to such business combination. In order to
obtain a physical share certificate
 a shareholder&rsquo;s broker and/or clearing broker
 DTC and our transfer agent will need
to act to facilitate this request. It is our understanding that shareholders should generally allot at least two weeks to obtain
physical certificates from the transfer agent. However
 because we do not have any control over this process or over the brokers
or DTC
 it may take significantly longer than two weeks to obtain a physical share certificate. It is also our understanding that
it takes a short time to deliver shares through the DWAC System. However
 this too may not be the case. Accordingly
 if it takes
longer than we anticipate for shareholders to deliver their shares
 shareholders who wish to convert may be unable to meet the
deadline for exercising their conversion rights and thus may be unable to convert their shares.

Investors
may not have sufficient time to comply with the delivery requirements for conversion.

Pursuant
to our memorandum and articles of association
 we are required to give a minimum of only ten days&rsquo; notice for each general
meeting. As a result
 if we require public shareholders who wish to convert their public shares into the right to receive a pro
rata portion of the funds in the trust account to comply with specific delivery requirements for conversion
 holders may not have
sufficient time to receive the notice and deliver their shares for conversion. Accordingly
 investors may not be able to exercise
their conversion rights and may be forced to retain our securities when they otherwise would not want to.

If
we require public shareholders who wish to convert their public shares to comply with the delivery requirements for conversion
such converting shareholders may be unable to sell their securities when they wish to in the event that the proposed business
combination is not approved.

If
we require public shareholders who wish to convert their public shares to comply with specific delivery requirements for conversion
described above and such proposed business combination is not consummated
 we will promptly return such certificates to the tendering
public shareholders. Accordingly
 investors who attempted to convert their shares in such a circumstance will be unable to sell
their securities after the failed acquisition until we have returned their securities to them. The market price for our shares
may decline during this time and our public shareholders may not be able to sell their securities when they wish to
 even while
other shareholders that did not seek conversion may be able to sell their securities.

Because
of our limited resources and structure
 other companies may have a competitive advantage and we may not be able to consummate
an attractive business combination.

We
expect to encounter intense competition from entities other than blank check companies having a business objective similar to
ours
 including venture capital funds
 leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. Many of these
entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through
affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical
 human and other resources than we do and our financial resources
will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe that there are numerous potential
target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering
 our ability to compete in acquiring
certain sizable target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives
others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore
 seeking shareholder approval of a business
combination may delay or prevent the consummation of a transaction
 a risk a target business may not be willing to accept. Additionally
our outstanding rights and warrants
 and the future dilution they potentially represent
 may not be viewed favorably by certain
target businesses. Any of the foregoing may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination.


    
    


Our
initial shareholders control a substantial interest in us and thus may influence certain actions requiring a shareholder vote.

Our
initial shareholders currently own approximately 19.76% of our issued and issued and outstanding ordinary shares. In connection
with any vote for a proposed business combination
 all of our initial shareholders
 as well as all of our officers and directors
have agreed to vote the ordinary shares owned by them at the time of the proposed business combination in favor of such proposed
business combination.

Our
board of directors is divided into three classes
 each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class
of directors being elected in each year. There is no requirement under the Companies Law for us to hold annual or general meetings
to elect directors. Accordingly
 shareholders would not have the right to such a meeting or election of directors
 unless the
holders of not less than 10% in par value capital of our company request such a meeting. As a result
 it is unlikely that there
will be an annual meeting of shareholders to elect new directors prior to the consummation of a business combination
 in which
case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the consummation of the business combination. Accordingly
our public shareholders may not be able to exercise your voting rights for up to 18 months. If there is an annual meeting
 as
a consequence of our &ldquo;staggered&rdquo; board of directors
 only a minority of the board of directors will be considered
for election and our initial shareholders
 because of their ownership position
 will have considerable influence regarding the
outcome. Accordingly
 our initial shareholders will continue to exert control at least until the consummation of a business combination.

Our
outstanding rights and warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our ordinary shares and make it more difficult
to effect a business combination.

We
have issued rights that will result in the issuance of an additional ordinary shares and warrants. The potential for the issuance
of a substantial number of additional shares upon conversion of the rights and exercise of the warrants could make us a less attractive
acquisition vehicle in the eyes of a target business. Such securities
 when converted or exercised
 will increase the number of
issued and issued and outstanding ordinary shares and reduce the value of the shares issued to complete the business combination.
Accordingly
 our rights and warrants may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of acquiring
the target business. Additionally
 the sale
 or even the possibility of sale
 of the shares underlying the rights and warrants
could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities or on our ability to obtain future financing. If and to the
extent these rights and warrants are converted or exercised
 our public shareholders may experience dilution to their holdings.

If
our shareholders exercise their registration rights with respect to their securities
 it may have an adverse effect on the market
price of our ordinary shares and the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to effect a business combination.

Our
initial shareholders are entitled to make a demand that we register the resale of their 2
700
000 insider shares at any time commencing
three months prior to the date on which their shares may be released from escrow. Additionally
 the purchasers of the private
units and our initial shareholders
 officers and directors are entitled to demand that we register the resale of the securities
underlying the private units and any securities our initial shareholders
 officers
 directors or their affiliates may be issued
in payment of working capital loans made to us at any time after we consummate a business combination. The presence of these additional
securities trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. In addition
 the existence
of these rights may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of acquiring the target business
as the shareholders of the target business may be discouraged from entering into a business combination with us or will request
a higher price for their securities because of the potential effect the exercise of such rights may have on the trading market
for our ordinary shares.

Each
of the joint book-running managers for our initial public offering may have a conflict of interest in rendering services to us
in connection with our initial business combination.

We
have engaged each of the joint book-running managers for our initial public offering to assist us in connection with our initial
business combination. We will pay each of them a cash fee for such services upon the consummation of our initial business combination
in an aggregate amount equal to 3% of the total gross proceeds raised in our initial public offering. In addition
 Cowen Investments
II LLC (&ldquo;Cowen Investments&rdquo;)
 an affiliate of Cowen
 holds 436
888 of our insider shares and purchased 92
157
of our private units
 and Craig-Hallum holds 187
238 of our insider shares and purchased 39
496 of our private units. These
securities will be worthless if we do not consummate an initial business combination. These financial interests may result in
the joint book-running managers having a conflict of interest when providing the services to us in connection with an initial
business combination.

If
we are deemed to be an investment company
 we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities
may be restricted
 which may make it difficult for us to complete a business combination.

A
company that
 among other things
 is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily
 or proposes to engage primarily
 in the business
of investing
 reinvesting
 owning
 trading or holding certain types of securities would be deemed an investment company under
the Investment Company Act of 1940. Since we will invest the proceeds held in the trust account
 it is possible that we could
be deemed an investment company. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 we do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will
subject us to the Investment Company Act of 1940. To this end
 the proceeds held in trust may be invested by the trustee only
in United States government treasury bills
 notes or bonds having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting
the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in United
States treasuries. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments
 we intend to meet the requirements for
the exemption provided in Rule 3a-1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940.


    
    


If
we are nevertheless deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940
 we may be subject to certain
restrictions that may make it more difficult for us to complete a business combination
 including:

&#9679;
restrictions on the nature of our investments; and

&#9679;
restrictions on the issuance of securities.

In
addition
 we may have imposed upon us certain burdensome requirements
 including:

&#9679;
registration as an investment company;

&#9679;
adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and

&#9679;
reporting
 record keeping
 voting
 proxy
 compliance policies and procedures and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations.

Compliance
with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expense for which we have not allotted.

We
may not seek an opinion from an unaffiliated third party as to the fair market value of the target business we acquire.

We
are not required to obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated third party that the target business we select has a fair market value
in excess of at least 80% of the balance of the trust account unless our board of directors cannot make such determination on
its own. We are also not required to obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated third party indicating that the price we are paying
is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view unless the target is affiliated with our officers
 directors
 initial
shareholders or their affiliates. If no opinion is obtained
 our shareholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of
directors
 whose collective experience in business evaluations for blank check companies like ours is not significant. Furthermore
our directors may have a conflict of interest in analyzing the transaction due to their personal and financial interests.

We
may acquire a target business that is affiliated with our officers
 directors
 initial shareholders or their affiliates.

While
we do not currently intend to pursue an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our officers
 directors
initial shareholders or their affiliates
 we are not prohibited from pursuing such a transaction
 nor are we prohibited from consummating
a business combination where any of our officers
 directors
 initial shareholders or their affiliates acquire a minority interest
in the target business alongside our acquisition
 provided in each case we obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated third party
indicating that the price we are paying is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view. These affiliations could cause
our officers or directors to have a conflict of interest in analyzing such transactions due to their personal and financial interests.

Because
we are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and our executive offices are located in Colombia
 our public shareholders
may face difficulties in protecting their interests
 and their ability to protect their rights through the U.S. Federal courts
may be limited.

We
are an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and our executive offices are located in Colombia. As
a result
 it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States on our company
 or enforce judgments
obtained in the United States courts against our company.

Our
corporate affairs are governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
 the Companies Law and the common
law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors
 actions by minority shareholders and
the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law
of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in
the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law
 the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority
 but are not
binding on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under
Cayman Islands law are different from statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular
the Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the United States. In addition
 Cayman Islands companies
may not have standing to initiate a shareholders derivative action in a Federal court of the United States.


    
    


We
have been advised by our Cayman Islands legal counsel that the courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (i) to recognize or enforce
against us judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws
of the United States or any state; and (ii) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands
 to impose liabilities against us
predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state
 so far as the
liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances
 although there is no statutory enforcement
in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States
 the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce
a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that
a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been
given provided certain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands
 such judgment must be
final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum
 and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty
 inconsistent with a Cayman
Islands judgment in respect of the same matter
 impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner
 and or be of a kind
the enforcement of which is
 contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple
damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent
proceedings are being brought elsewhere.

As
a result of all of the above
 public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions
taken by management
 members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a
United States company.

We
may effect a business combination with a company located outside of the United States and if we do
 we would be subject to a variety
of additional risks that may negatively impact our business operations and financial results.

If
we consummate a business combination with a target business located outside of the United States
 we would be subject to any special
considerations or risks associated with companies operating in the target business&rsquo; governing jurisdiction
 including any
of the following:



    
    
rules
    and regulations or currency redemption or corporate withholding taxes on individuals;

    
    
    

    
    
tariffs and trade
    barriers;

    
    
    

    
    
regulations related
    to customs and import/export matters;

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
economic policies
    and market conditions;

    
    
    

    
    
unexpected changes
    in regulatory requirements;

    
    
    

    
    
challenges in managing
    and staffing international operations;

    
    
    

    
    
tax issues
 such
    as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States;

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
    

    
    
challenges in collecting
    accounts receivable;

    
    
    

    
    
cultural and language
    differences;

    
    
    

    
    
protection of intellectual
    property; and

    
    
    

    
    
    


There
can be no assurances that we would be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we were unable to do so
 our operations
might suffer.

If
we effect a business combination with a company located outside of the United States
 the laws applicable to such company will
likely govern all of our material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights.

If
we effect a business combination with a company located outside of the United States
 the laws of the country in which such company
operates will govern almost all of the material agreements relating to its operations. There can be no assurances that the target
business will be able to enforce any of its material agreements or that remedies will be available in this new jurisdiction. The
system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdiction may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation
as in the United States. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements could result in a significant
loss of business
 business opportunities or capital. Additionally
 if we acquire a company located outside of the United States
it is likely that substantially all of our assets would be located outside of the United States and some of our officers and directors
might reside outside of the United States. As a result
 it may not be possible for investors in the United States to enforce their
legal rights
 to effect service of process upon our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated
upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties of our directors and officers under Federal securities laws.


    
    


Because
we must furnish our shareholders with financial statements of the target business prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS
as issued by the IASB or reconciled to U.S. GAAP
 we may not be able to complete an initial business combination with some prospective
target businesses.

The
federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial
significance tests include historical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports. These financial statements
may be required to be prepared in accordance with
 or be reconciled to
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America
 or GAAP
 or international financial reporting standards
 or IFRS
 depending on the circumstances
 and the historical
financial statements are required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States)
 or PCAOB. The financial statements may also be required to be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the Form
8-K announcing the closing of an initial business combination
 which would need to be filed within four business days thereafter.
These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire.

Compliance
with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will require substantial financial and management resources and may increase the time and
costs of completing an acquisition.

Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31
 2020. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or
an accelerated filer will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement
on our internal control over financial reporting. Further
 for as long as we remain an emerging growth company
 we will not be
required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over
financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target company with which we seek to complete our
initial business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its
internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.

We
are an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging
growth companies will make our securities less attractive to investors.

We
are an &ldquo;emerging growth company
&rdquo; as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the
earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering
(b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion
 or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated
filer
 which means the market value of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700
million as of the prior June 30
 and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during
the prior three year period. As an emerging growth company
 we are not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements
of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 we have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic
reports and proxy statements
 and we are exempt from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation
and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Additionally
 as an emerging growth company
we have elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and
private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As such
 our financial statements may not be comparable to
companies that comply with public company effective dates. We cannot predict if investors will find our shares less attractive
because we may rely on these provisions. If some investors find our shares less attractive as a result
 there may be a less active
trading market for our shares and our share price may be more volatile.

Further
Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial
accounting standards until private companies (that is
 those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared
effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised
financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and
comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We
have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has
different application dates for public or private companies
 we
 as an emerging growth company
 will not adopt the new or revised
standard until the time private companies are required to adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial
statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted
out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards
used.

We
may be a passive foreign investment company
 which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. investors.

If
we are determined to be a PFIC (under the rules described below) for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in
the holding period of a U.S. Holder (as defined below) of our ordinary shares or warrants
 the U.S. Holder may be subject to adverse
U.S. federal income tax consequences and may be subject to additional reporting requirements. The term &ldquo;U.S. Holder&rdquo;
means a beneficial owner of ordinary shares or warrants who or that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes: (i) an individual
citizen or resident of the United States
 (ii) a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal
income tax purposes) that is created or organized (or treated as created or organized) in or under the laws of the United States
any state thereof or the District of Columbia
 (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income
taxation regardless of its source or (iv) a trust if (A) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision
over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the
trust
 or (B) it has in effect a valid election to be treated as a U.S. person.


    
    


A
foreign (i.e.
 non-U.S.) corporation will be a PFIC for U.S. tax purposes if at least 75% of its gross income in a taxable year
including its pro rata share of the gross income of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares
by value
 is passive income. Alternatively
 a foreign corporation will be a PFIC if at least 50% of its assets in a taxable year
of the foreign corporation
 ordinarily determined based on fair market value and averaged quarterly over the year
 including its
pro rata share of the assets of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by value
 are held
for the production of
 or produce
 passive income. Passive income generally includes dividends
 interest
 rents and royalties
(other than rents or royalties derived from the active conduct of a trade or business) and gains from the disposition of passive
assets.

Because
we are a blank check company
 with no current active business
 we believe that it is likely that we will meet the PFIC asset or
income test for the taxable year ending December 31
 2020. However
 pursuant to a start-up exception
 a corporation will not be
a PFIC for the first taxable year the corporation has gross income (the &ldquo;start-up year&rdquo;
 which in our case is the
taxable year ending December 31
 2019)
 if (1) no predecessor of the corporation was a PFIC; (2) the corporation satisfies the
IRS that it will not be a PFIC for either of the two taxable years following the start-up year; and (3) the corporation is not
in fact a PFIC for either of those years. The applicability of the start-up exception to us will not be known until after the
close of our current taxable year ending December 31
 2019. After the acquisition of a company or assets in a business combination
we may still meet one of the PFIC tests depending on the timing of the acquisition and the amount of our passive income and assets
as well as the passive income and assets of the acquired business. If the company that we acquire in a business combination is
a PFIC
 then we will likely not qualify for the start-up exception and will be a PFIC for our current taxable year ending December
31
 2019. Our actual PFIC status for our current taxable year or any future taxable year
 however
 will not be determinable until
after the end of such taxable year. Accordingly
 there can be no assurance with respect to our status as a PFIC for our current
taxable year ending December 31
 2019 or any future taxable year.

If
we are determined to be a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. Holder
of our ordinary shares or warrants and
 in the case of our ordinary shares
 the U.S. Holder did not make either a timely qualified
electing fund (&ldquo;QEF&rdquo;) election for our first taxable year as a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder held (or was deemed to
hold) ordinary shares or a timely &ldquo;mark to market&rdquo; election
 each as described below
 such holder generally will be
subject to special rules with respect to:



    
    
any
    gain recognized by the U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of its ordinary shares or warrants; and

    
    
    

    
    
any
    &ldquo;excess distribution&rdquo; made to the U.S. Holder (generally
 any distributions to such U.S. Holder during a taxable
    year of the U.S. Holder that are greater than 125% of the average annual distributions received by such U.S. Holder in respect
    of the ordinary shares during the three preceding taxable years of such U.S. Holder or
 if shorter
 such U.S. Holder&rsquo;s
    holding period for the ordinary shares).


Under
these rules




    
    
the
    U.S. Holder&rsquo;s gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder&rsquo;s holding period for
    the ordinary shares and warrants (as applicable);

    
    
    

    
    
the
    amount allocated to the U.S. Holder&rsquo;s taxable year in which the U.S. Holder recognized the gain or received the excess
    distribution
 or to the period in the U.S. Holder&rsquo;s holding period before the first day of our first taxable year in
    which we are a PFIC
 will be taxed as ordinary income;

    
    
    

    
    
the
    amount allocated to other taxable years (or portions thereof) of the U.S. Holder and included in its holding period will be
    taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for that year and applicable to the U.S. Holder; and

    
    
    

    
    
the
    interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed in respect of the tax attributable to each such
    other taxable year of the U.S. Holder.


In
general
 if we are determined to be a PFIC
 a U.S. Holder may avoid the PFIC tax consequences described above in respect to our
ordinary shares (but not our warrants) by making a timely QEF election (if eligible to do so) to include in income its pro rata
share of our net capital gains (as long-term capital gain) and other earnings and profits (as ordinary income)
 on a current basis
in each case whether or not distributed
 in the taxable year of the U.S. Holder in which or with which our taxable year ends.
A U.S. Holder generally may make a separate election to defer the payment of taxes on undistributed income inclusions under the
QEF rules
 but if deferred
 any such taxes will be subject to an interest charge.


    
    


A
U.S. Holder may not make a QEF election with respect to its warrants to acquire our ordinary shares. As a result
 if a U.S. Holder
sells or otherwise disposes of such warrants (other than upon exercise of such warrants)
 any gain recognized generally will be
subject to the special tax and interest charge rules treating the gain as an excess distribution
 as described above
 if we were
a PFIC at any time during the period the U.S. Holder held the warrants. If a U.S. Holder that exercises such warrants properly
makes a QEF election with respect to the newly acquired ordinary shares (or has previously made a QEF election with respect to
our ordinary shares)
 the QEF election will apply to the newly acquired ordinary shares
 but the adverse tax consequences relating
to PFIC shares
 adjusted to take into account the current income inclusions resulting from the QEF election
 will continue to
apply with respect to such newly acquired ordinary shares (which generally will be deemed to have a holding period for purposes
of the PFIC rules that includes the period the U.S. Holder held the warrants)
 unless the U.S. Holder makes a purging election.
The purging election creates a deemed sale of such shares at their fair market value. The gain recognized by the purging election
will be subject to the special tax and interest charge rules treating the gain as an excess distribution
 as described above.
As a result of the purging election
 the U.S. Holder will have a new basis and holding period in the ordinary shares acquired
upon the exercise of the warrants for purposes of the PFIC rules.

The
QEF election is made on a shareholder-by-shareholder basis and
 once made
 can be revoked only with the consent of the IRS. A
QEF election may not be made with respect to our warrants. A U.S. Holder generally makes a QEF election by attaching a completed
IRS Form 8621 (Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company or Qualified Electing Fund)
 including the information
provided in a PFIC annual information statement
 to a timely filed U.S. federal income tax return for the tax year to which the
election relates. Retroactive QEF elections generally may be made only by filing a protective statement with such return and if
certain other conditions are met or with the consent of the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding
the availability and tax consequences of a retroactive QEF election under their particular circumstances.

In
order to comply with the requirements of a QEF election
 a U.S. Holder must receive a PFIC annual information statement from us.
If we determine we are a PFIC for any taxable year
 we will endeavor to provide to a U.S. Holder such information as the IRS may
require
 including a PFIC annual information statement
 in order to enable the U.S. Holder to make and maintain a QEF election.
However
 there is no assurance that we will have timely knowledge of our status as a PFIC in the future or of the required information
to be provided.

If
a U.S. Holder has made a QEF election with respect to our ordinary shares
 and the special tax and interest charge rules do not
apply to such shares (because of a timely QEF election for our first taxable year as a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder holds (or
is deemed to hold) such shares or a purge of the PFIC taint pursuant to a purging election
 as described above)
 any gain recognized
on the sale of our ordinary shares generally will be taxable as capital gain and no interest charge will be imposed under the
PFIC rules. As discussed above
 U.S. Holders of a QEF are currently taxed on their pro rata shares of its earnings and profits
whether or not distributed. In such case
 a subsequent distribution of such earnings and profits that were previously included
in income generally should not be taxable as a dividend to such U.S. Holders. The tax basis of a U.S. Holder&rsquo;s shares in
a QEF will be increased by amounts that are included in income
 and decreased by amounts distributed but not taxed as dividends
under the above rules.

Although
a determination as to our PFIC status will be made annually
 an initial determination that our company is a PFIC will generally
apply for subsequent years to a U.S. Holder who held ordinary shares or warrants while we were a PFIC
 whether or not we meet
the test for PFIC status in those subsequent years. A U.S. Holder who makes the QEF election discussed above for our first taxable
year as a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) our ordinary shares
 however
 will not be subject to the
PFIC tax and interest charge rules discussed above in respect to such shares. In addition
 such U.S. Holder will not be subject
to the QEF inclusion regime with respect to such shares for any taxable year of us that ends within or with a taxable year of
the U.S. Holder and in which we are not a PFIC. On the other hand
 if the QEF election is not effective for each of our taxable
years in which we are a PFIC and the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) our ordinary shares
 the PFIC rules discussed above
will continue to apply to such shares unless the holder makes a purging election
 as described above
 and pays the tax and interest
charge with respect to the gain inherent in such shares attributable to the pre-QEF election period.

Alternatively
if a U.S. Holder
 at the close of its taxable year
 owns shares in a PFIC that are treated as marketable stock
 the U.S. Holder
may make a mark-to-market election with respect to such shares for such taxable year. If the U.S. Holder makes a valid mark-to-market
election for the first taxable year of the U.S. Holder in which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) ordinary shares in
us and for which we are determined to be a PFIC
 such holder generally will not be subject to the PFIC rules described above in
respect to its ordinary shares. Instead
 in general
 the U.S. Holder will include as ordinary income each year the excess
 if
any
 of the fair market value of its ordinary shares at the end of its taxable year over the adjusted basis in its ordinary shares.
The U.S. Holder also will be allowed to take an ordinary loss in respect of the excess
 if any
 of the adjusted basis of its ordinary
shares over the fair market value of its ordinary shares at the end of its taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount
of previously included income as a result of the mark-to-market election). The U.S. Holder&rsquo;s basis in its ordinary shares
will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts
 and any further gain recognized on a sale or other taxable disposition
of the ordinary shares will be treated as ordinary income. Currently
 a mark-to-market election likely may not be made with respect
to our warrants.

The
mark-to-market election is available only for stock that is regularly traded on a national securities exchange that is registered
with the Securities and Exchange Commission
 including the Nasdaq Capital Market
 or on a foreign exchange or market that the
IRS determines has rules sufficient to ensure that the market price represents a legitimate and sound fair market value. U.S.
Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability and tax consequences of a mark-to-market election in
respect to our ordinary shares under their particular circumstances.


    
    


If
we are a PFIC and
 at any time
 have a foreign subsidiary that is classified as a PFIC
 U.S. Holders generally would be deemed
to own a portion of the shares of such lower-tier PFIC
 and generally could incur liability for the deferred tax and interest
charge described above if we receive a distribution from
 or dispose of all or part of our interest in
 the lower-tier PFIC or
the U.S. Holders otherwise were deemed to have disposed of an interest in the lower-tier PFIC. We will endeavor to cause any lower-tier
PFIC to provide to a U.S. Holder the information that may be required to make or maintain a QEF election with respect to the lower-tier
PFIC. However
 there is no assurance that we will have timely knowledge of the status of any such lower-tier PFIC. In addition
we may not hold a controlling interest in any such lower-tier PFIC and thus there can be no assurance we will be able to cause
the lower-tier PFIC to provide the required information. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the
tax issues raised by lower-tier PFICs.

A
U.S. Holder that owns (or is deemed to own) shares in a PFIC during any taxable year of the U.S. Holder
 may have to file an IRS
Form 8621(whether or not a QEF or market-to-market election is made) and such other information as may be required by the U.S.
Treasury Department.

The
rules dealing with PFICs and with the QEF and mark-to-market elections are very complex and are affected by various factors in
addition to those described above. Accordingly
 U.S. Holders of our ordinary shares or warrants should consult their own tax advisors
concerning the application of the PFIC rules to our ordinary shares or warrants under their particular circumstances.


Our search
for a business combination
 and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination
 may be materially
adversely affected by the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.

In
December 2019
 a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan
 China
 which has and is continuing to spread
throughout China and other parts of the world
 including the United States. On January 30
 2020
 the World Health Organization
declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a &ldquo;Public Health Emergency of International Concern.&rdquo;
On January 31
 2020
 U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for the United
States to aid the U.S. healthcare community in responding to COVID-19
 and on March 11
 2020 the World Health Organization characterized
the outbreak as a &ldquo;pandemic&rdquo;. A significant outbreak of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases could result in a widespread
health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide
 and the business of any potential target
business with which we consummate a business combination could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore
 we may be unable
to complete a business combination if continued concerns relating to COVID-19 restrict travel
 limit the ability to have meetings
with potential investors or the target company&rsquo;s personnel
 vendors and services providers are unavailable to negotiate
and consummate a transaction in a timely manner. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a business combination will
depend on future developments
 which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted
 including new information which may emerge
concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact
 among others. If the disruptions
posed by COVID-19 or other matters of global concern continue for an extensive period of time
 our ability to consummate a business
combination
 or the operations of a target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination
 may be materially
adversely affected.

Risks
related to operations in Latin America

After
a business combination
 substantially all of our assets will likely be located in Latin America and substantially all of our revenue
will be derived from our operations in Latin America. Accordingly
 our results of operations and prospects will be subject
 to
a significant extent
 to the economic
 political and legal policies
 developments and conditions in the region

Economic
political and social conditions
 as well as government policies
 in Latin America could affect our business. Future government
actions concerning the economy and taxation could have a significant effect on us following our initial business combination.
Any changes in regulations or shifts in political attitudes are beyond our control and may adversely affect our business.

If
relations between the United States and countries in Latin America deteriorate
 potential target businesses or their goods or
services could become less attractive.

The
relationship between the United States and countries in Latin America is subject to sudden fluctuation and periodic tension. Changes
in political conditions in these regions and changes in the state of United States relations with countries in these regions are
difficult to predict and could adversely affect our operations or cause potential target businesses or their goods and services
to become less attractive.

If
our management following a business combination is unfamiliar with United States securities laws
 they may have to expend time
and resources becoming familiar with such laws which could lead to various regulatory issues.

Following
a business combination
 our management will likely resign from their positions as officers of the company and the management of
the target business at the time of the business combination will remain in place. There can be no assurances that management of
the target business will be familiar with United States securities laws. If new management is unfamiliar with our laws
 they may
have to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such laws. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead
to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect our operations.

If
restrictions on repatriation of earnings from the target business&rsquo; home jurisdiction to foreign entities are instituted
our business following a business combination may be materially negatively affected.

It
is possible that following an initial business combination
 the home jurisdiction of the target business may have restrictions
on repatriations of earnings or additional restrictions may be imposed in the future. If they were
 it could have a material adverse
effect on our operations.

Currencies
of companies operating in Latin America may depreciate significantly over time.

Currencies
of countries in Latin America
 such as Brazil
 Chile
 Colombia and Peru
 have experienced significant depreciation in the past.
If we acquire a target business in one of these countries
 we could be subject to currency fluctuations which could adversely
impact our operations and profitability.

Local
accounting practices vary significantly and reconciling the accounting practices of a target business to U.S. accounting practices
could be time consuming and expensive.

Local
accounting practices vary significantly from country to country. Although Colombia
 Peru and Chile have all adopted IFRS in recent
years
 there is still divergence among countries. If we need to reconcile accounting practices of a target business to U.S. generally
accepted accounting practices
 it could be time consuming and expensive and could have a negative impact on our results of operations
and profitability.


    
    


A
global economic downturn could have a greater negative impact on countries in Latin America than in other parts of the world.

Although
a global economic downturn would impact all countries worldwide
 it could have a greater negative impact on countries in Latin
America. As commodity exporters
 these countries have been impacted by the decline in international price of raw materials. However
a deepening of the global slowdown or an external crisis could more severely impact the slowdown in the countries of this region.

We
are a blank check company formed on July 29
 2016 for the purpose of entering into a merger
 share exchange
 asset acquisition
stock purchase
 recapitalization
 reorganization or other similar Business Combination with one or more target businesses. We
intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale
of the private units
 our capital stock
 debt or a combination of cash
 stock and debt.

The
issuance of additional ordinary shares or preferred shares:



    
may
    significantly reduce the equity interest of our shareholders;

    
may
    subordinate the rights of holders of ordinary shares if we issue preferred shares with rights senior to those afforded to
    our ordinary shares;

    
will
    likely cause a change in control if a substantial number of our ordinary shares are issued
 which may affect
 among other
    things
 our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards
 if any
 and most likely will also result in the resignation
    or removal of our present officers and directors; and

    
may
    adversely affect prevailing market prices for our securities.


Similarly
if we issue debt securities
 it could result in:



    
default
    and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a Business Combination are insufficient to pay our debt obligations;

    
acceleration
    of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we have made all principal and interest payments when due if the debt
    security contains covenants that required the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves and we breach any such covenant
    without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;

    
our
    immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest
 if any
 if the debt security is payable on demand; and

    
our
    inability to obtain additional financing
 if necessary
 if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to
    obtain additional financing while such security is outstanding.


Results
of Operations

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities through December 31
 2019 were
organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for our initial public offering
 described below
 and
 after our initial
public offering
 identifying a target company for a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues
until after the completion of our Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable
securities held in the Trust Account. We are incurring expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal
 financial reporting
accounting and auditing compliance)
 as well as for due diligence expenses.


    
    


For
the year ended December 31
 2019
 we had net income of $1
762
447
 which consists of interest income on marketable securities
held in the Trust Account of $2
136
694 and an unrealized gain on marketable securities held in our Trust Account of $12
428
offset by operating costs of $386
675.

For
the year ended December 31
 2018
 we had a net loss of $14
772 which consists of operating and formation costs.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

On
January 31
 2019
 we consummated our initial public offering of 10
800
000 Units
 which includes a partial exercise by the underwriters
of their over-allotment option in the amount of 800
000 Units
 at a price of $10.00 per Unit
 generating gross proceeds of $108
000
000.
Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering we consummated the sale of 395
000 private units to certain initial
shareholders and the underwriters at a price of $10.00 per unit
 generating gross proceeds of $3
950
000.

Following
our initial public offering and the sale of the private units
 a total of $108
000
000 was placed in the Trust Account. We incurred
$3
204
451 in initial public offering related costs
 including $2
700
000 of underwriting fees and $504
451 of other costs.

As
of December 31
 2019
 we had marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $110
149
122 (including approximately $2
137
000
of interest income and approximately $12
000 of unrealized gains) consisting of U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of 180 days
or less. Interest income on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. Through December 31
 2019
 we did
not withdraw any interest earned on the Trust Account.

For
the year ended December 31
 2019
 cash used in operating activities was $399
103. Net income of $1
762
447 was offset by interest
earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $2
136
694
 an unrealized gain on marketable securities held in our
Trust Account of $12
428 and changes in operating assets and liabilities
 which used $12
428 of cash for operating activities.

We
intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account
 including any amounts representing interest earned on
the Trust Account (less taxes payable) to complete our initial Business Combination. We may withdraw interest from the Trust Account
to pay franchise and income taxes. To the extent that our equity or debt is used
 in whole or in part
 as consideration to complete
our initial Business Combination
 the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance
the operations of the target business or businesses
 make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.

Following
our initial public offering
 we entered into a letter agreement with a member of our board of directors that provides for a success
fee to be paid to such director upon consummation of a Business Combination with a target business introduced to us by such director
in an amount equal to 0.6% of the total consideration paid by us in the transaction
 subject to certain minimum and maximum amounts
set forth in the agreement.

In
addition
 we entered into several letter agreements with unaffiliated third parties that provide for a success fee to be paid
to each such third party upon consummation of a Business Combination with a target business introduced to us by such third party
in amounts ranging from 0.75% to 1% of the total consideration paid by us in the transaction
 subject to certain minimum and maximum
amounts set forth in the various agreements.

As
of December 31
 2019
 we had cash of 352
524 held outside of the Trust Account. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust
Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses
 perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses
travel to and from the offices
 plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners
review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses
 and structure
 negotiate and complete a Business
Combination.

We
do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business prior
to our initial Business Combination. However
 if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business
 undertaking in-depth
due diligence and negotiating an initial Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so
 we may have
insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business Combination. Moreover
 we may need to obtain additional
financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public
shares upon completion of our Business Combination
 in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection
with such Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination because we do not have sufficient
funds available to us
 we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements; Commitments and Contractual Obligations

We
have no obligations
 assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31
 2019. We
do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships
 often referred
to as variable interest entities
 which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements
 established any special purpose entities
 guaranteed any
debt or commitments of other entities
 or purchased any non-financial assets.


    
    


Contractual
Obligations

We
do not have any long-term debt
 capital lease obligations
 operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities other than as
described below.

We
entered into an agreement to pay the joint book-running managers in our initial public offering as advisors in connection with
a Business Combination to assist us in holding meetings with its shareholders to discuss the potential Business Combination and
the target business&rsquo; attributes
 introduce us to potential investors that are interested in purchasing our securities in
connection with a Business Combination
 assist us in obtaining shareholder approval for the Business Combination and assist us
with its press releases and public filings in connection with the Business Combination. We will pay the joint book-running managers
aggregate cash fees for such services upon the consummation of a Business Combination in an amount equal to $3
240
000 (exclusive
of any applicable finders&rsquo; fees which might become payable).

We
entered into a letter agreement with a member of our board of directors that provides for a success fee to be paid to such director
upon consummation of a Business Combination with a target business introduced to us by such director in an amount equal to 0.6%
of the total consideration paid by us in the transaction
 subject to certain minimum and maximum amounts set forth in the agreement.

In
addition
 we entered into several letter agreements with unaffiliated third parties that provide for a success fee to be paid
to each such third party upon consummation of a Business Combination with a target business introduced to us by such third party
in amounts ranging from 0.75% to 1.0% of the total consideration paid by us in the transaction
 subject to certain minimum and
maximum amounts set forth in the various agreements.

Critical
Accounting Policies

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
 disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements
 and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ
from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies:

Ordinary
shares subject to redemption

We
account for our ordinary shares subject to possible conversion in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification
(&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) Topic 480 &ldquo;Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.&rdquo; Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption
are classified as a liability instrument and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary
shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence
of uncertain events not solely within our control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times
 ordinary shares are
classified as shareholders&rsquo; equity. Our ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside
of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly
 ordinary shares subject to possible redemption
are presented at redemption value as temporary equity
 outside of the shareholders&rsquo; equity section of our balance sheets.

Net
loss per ordinary share

We
apply the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Ordinary shares subject to possible redemption which are not currently
redeemable and are not redeemable at fair value
 have been excluded from the calculation of basic net loss per ordinary share
since such shares
 if redeemed
 only participate in their pro rata share of the Trust Account earnings. Our net income is adjusted
for the portion of income that is attributable to ordinary shares subject to redemption
 as these shares only participate in the
earnings of the Trust Account and not our income or losses.

Recent
accounting standards

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued
 but not yet effective
 accounting pronouncements
 if currently adopted
 would
have a material effect on our financial statements.

9A. CONTROL AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
of Controls and Procedures

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management
 including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
(together
 the &ldquo;Certifying Officers&rdquo;)
 we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing
our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered
by this report.

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded
 processed
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC&rsquo;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include
 without limitation
 controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to management
 including our Certifying Officers
 or persons performing similar functions
 as appropriate
 to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management&rsquo;s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Under the supervision
and with the participation of our management
 including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
 we conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31
 2019
 based on the criteria
established in Internal Control &mdash; Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation
 our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of December 31
 2019.

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of
the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected
 or are reasonably likely to materially
affect
 our internal control over financial reporting.

 management
 shareholders

integrity and professionalism in evaluating a person&rsquo;s candidacy for membership on the board of directors. The nominating
committee may require certain skills or attributes
 such as financial or accounting experience
 to meet specific board needs that
arise from time to time and will also consider the overall experience and makeup of its members to obtain a broad and diverse
mix of board members. The nominating committee does not distinguish among nominees recommended by shareholders and other persons.

Effective
January 28

 we established a compensation committee of the board of directors

Code
of Ethics

Effective
January 28
 2019
 we adopted a code of ethics that applies to all of our executive officers
 directors
 and employees. The code
of ethics codifies the business and ethical principles that govern all aspects of our business.


    
    


Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers
 directors
 and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of
our equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Officers
directors
 and ten percent stockholders are required by regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
Based solely on copies of such forms received or written representations from certain reporting persons that no Form 5s were required
for those persons
 we believe that
 during the fiscal year ended December 31
 2019
 all filing requirements applicable to our
officers
 directors
 and greater than ten percent beneficial owners were complied with.

ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Executive
Compensation

No
executive officer has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. We may pay consulting
 finder or success fees
to our officers
 directors
 shareholders or their affiliates for assisting us in consummating our initial business combination.
They will also receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf
such as identifying potential target businesses
 performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business
combinations
 as well as traveling to and from the offices
 plants
 or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine
their operations. There is no limit on the amount of out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us.

After
our initial business combination
 members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting
 management
 or other
fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to shareholders
 to the extent then known
 in the
proxy solicitation materials furnished to our shareholders. The amount of such compensation may not be known at the time of a
shareholder meeting held to consider an initial business combination
 as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination
business to determine executive and director compensation. In this event
 such compensation will be publicly disclosed at the
time of its determination in a Current Report on Form 8-K
 as required by the SEC.

Since
our formation
 we have not granted any stock options or stock appreciation rights or any other awards under long-term incentive
plans to any of our executive officers or directors.

ITEM
13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
 AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE

In
July and August 2016
 we issued an aggregate of 2
875
000 ordinary shares to B. Luke Weil for $25
000 in cash
 at a purchase price
of approximately $0.009 share. Mr. Weil thereafter subsequently transferred certain insider shares to other initial shareholders
including the underwriters in our initial public offering
 at the same price originally paid for such shares. Simultaneously with
the initial public offering
 the underwriters partially exercised their over-allotment option for 800
000 of the total possible
1
500
000 additional units. Because the underwriters&rsquo; exercised the over-allotment option in part
 our initial shareholders
forfeited an aggregate of 175
000 insider shares.

In
January 2019
 certain of our initial shareholders
 including the underwriters in our initial public offering
 purchased an aggregate
of 395
000 private units at $10.00 per unit (for a total purchase price of $3
950
000) in a private placement closed simultaneously
with the closing of our initial public offering. The private units are identical to the units sold in our initial public offering
except that the warrants underlying the private units are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis
 in each case
so long as they continue to be held by the initial shareholders or their permitted transferees. The purchasers of the private
units have agreed (A) to vote the ordinary shares underlying the private units in favor of any proposed business combination
(B) not to propose
 or vote in favor of
 an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association with
respect to our pre-business combination activities prior to the consummation of such a business combination unless we provide
public shareholders with the opportunity to convert their public shares in connection with any such vote
 (C) not to convert any
ordinary shares underlying the private units for cash from the trust account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve
a proposed initial business combination or a vote to amend the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles
of association relating to shareholders&rsquo; rights or pre-business combination activity
 and (D) that the ordinary shares underlying
the private units shall not participate in any liquidating distribution from the trust account upon winding up if a business combination
is not consummated. The purchasers of private units have also agreed not to transfer
 assign or sell any of the private units
or underlying securities (except to certain permitted transferees) until the completion of our initial business combination.

If
any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of
any entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations
 he or she may be required to present such
business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us
 subject to his
or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties
or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us.

Our
officers and directors
 or any of their respective affiliates
 will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business
combinations. Our audit committee reviews
 on a quarterly basis
 all payments that were made to our officers
 directors or our
or their affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling
on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf.

Prior
to the consummation of our initial public offering
 B. Luke Weil
 the Chairman of our Board
 loaned us an aggregate of $34
259
which were used for a portion of the expenses of our initial public offering. The loans were fully repaid upon the closing of
our initial public offering.

In
order to meet its working capital needs following the consummation of our initial public offering
 our initial shareholders
 officers
and directors or their affiliates may
 but are not obligated to
 loan the Company funds
 from time to time or at any time
 in
whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would
either be paid upon consummation of the Company&rsquo;s initial business combination
 without interest
 or
 at the lender&rsquo;s
discretion
 up to $500
000 of the notes may be converted upon consummation of the Company&rsquo;s initial business combination
into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per unit. In the event that the initial business combination does not close
the Company may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts
 but no proceeds
from the trust account would be used for such repayment.

We
entered into a letter agreement with a member of our board of directors that provides for a success fee to be paid to such director
upon consummation of a Business Combination with a target business introduced to us by such director in an amount equal to 0.6%
of the total consideration paid by us in the transaction
 subject to certain minimum and maximum amounts set forth in the agreement.

We
have entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the insider shares
 private units and any securities issued
upon conversion of working capital loans (if any).

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of
Andina Acquisition Corp. III

Opinion
on the Financial Statements

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Andina Acquisition Corp. III (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of December 31
 2019
and 2018
 the related statements of operations
 changes in shareholders&rsquo; equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of
the two years in the period ended December 31
 2019
 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
&ldquo;financial statements&rdquo;). In our opinion
 the financial statements present fairly
 in all material respects
 the financial
position of the Company as of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the two years in the period ended December 31
 2019
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

Basis
for Opinion

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company&rsquo;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the &ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement
 whether due to error
or fraud. The Company is not required to have
 nor were we engaged to perform
 an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits
 we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly
 we express no such opinion.

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
 whether due to
error or fraud
 and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining
 on a test basis
 evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management
 as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

ANDINA
ACQUISITION CORP. III
NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER
31
 2019

Note
1 &mdash; Organization and Plan of Business Operations

Andina
Acquisition Corp. III (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) was incorporated in the Cayman Islands on July 29
 2016 as a blank check company
for the purpose of effecting a merger
 share exchange
 asset acquisition
 share purchase
 recapitalization
 reorganization or
other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (a &ldquo;Business Combination&rdquo;). The Company&rsquo;s
efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region
 although
the Company initially intends to focus on target businesses in the Americas.

All
activity through December 31
 2019 relates to the Company&rsquo;s formation
 its initial public offering (the &ldquo;Initial Public
Offering&rdquo;)
 which is described below
 and the search for Business Combination candidates. The Company is subject to all
of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.

Initial
Public Offering

The
registration statement for the Initial Public Offering was declared effective on January 24
 2019 pursuant to Section 8(a) of
the Securities Act of 1933
 as amended. On January 31
 2019
 the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 10
800
000
units (the &ldquo;Units&rdquo; and
 with respect to the ordinary shares included in the Units offered
 the &ldquo;Public Shares&rdquo;)
which included a partial exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 800
000 Units
 at
$10.00 per Unit
 generating gross proceeds of $108
000
000
 which is described in Note 3.

Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering
 the Company consummated the sale of 395
000 units (the &ldquo;Private Units&rdquo;)
at a price of $10.00 per Unit in a private placement (the &ldquo;Private Placement&rdquo;) to certain shareholders
 or their affiliates
(collectively
 the &ldquo;Initial Shareholders&rdquo;) and the underwriters
 generating gross proceeds of $3
950
000
 which is
described in Note 4.

Transaction
costs amounted to $3
204
451
 consisting of $2
700
000 of underwriting fees and $504
451 of offering costs. In addition
 as of
December 31
 2019
 cash of $352
524 was held outside of the Trust Account (defined below) and is available for working capital
purposes.

Following
the closing of the Initial Public Offering on January 31
 2019
 an amount of $108
000
000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds
of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Units was placed in a trust account (the &ldquo;Trust
Account&rdquo;)
 which has been invested in U.S. government securities
 within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940
 as amended (the &ldquo;Investment Company Act&rdquo;)
 with a maturity of 180 days or less or
in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment
Company Act
 as determined by the Company
 until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution
of the Trust Account to its shareholders
 as described below. The Company&rsquo;s management has broad discretion with respect
to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and sale of the Private Units
 although substantially
all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. Placing funds in the
Trust Account may not protect those funds from third party claims against the Company. Although the Company will seek to have
all vendors
 service providers
 prospective target businesses or other entities it engages
 execute agreements with the Company
waiving any claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account
 there is no guarantee that such persons will execute
such agreements. One of the Company&rsquo;s directors has agreed to be personally liable if the Company liquidates the Trust Account
prior to the consummation of a Business Combination to ensure that the proceeds held in the Trust Account are not reduced by the
claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by the Company for services rendered or
contracted for or products sold to the Company. However
 such director may not be able to satisfy those obligations should they
arise. The remaining net proceeds (not held in the Trust Account) may be used to pay for business
 legal and accounting due diligence
on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses. Additionally
 the interest earned on the Trust
Account balance may be released to the Company to pay the Company&rsquo;s tax obligations and up to $100
000 may be released to
pay for the Company&rsquo;s working capital obligations
 including any necessary liquidation or dissolution expenses.

In
order to meet its working capital needs following the consummation of the Initial Public Offering
 the Company&rsquo;s Initial
Shareholders
 officers and directors or their affiliates may
 but are not obligated to
 loan the Company funds
 from time to time
or at any time
 in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory
note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of the Company&rsquo;s initial Business Combination
 without interest
or
 at the lender&rsquo;s discretion. Up to $500
000 of the notes may be converted upon consummation of the Company&rsquo;s initial
Business Combination into additional Private Units at a price of $10.00 per unit. In the event that the initial Business Combination
does not close
 the Company may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts
but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used for such repayment.

Initial
Business Combination

Pursuant
to the Nasdaq Capital Markets listing rules
 the Company&rsquo;s initial Business Combination must be with a target business or
businesses whose collective fair market value is at least equal to 80% of the balance in the Trust Account at the time of the
execution of a definitive agreement for such Business Combination
 although this may entail simultaneous acquisitions of several
target businesses. The fair market value of the target will be determined by the Company&rsquo;s board of directors based upon
one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales
 earnings
 cash flow and/or
book value). The target business or businesses that the Company acquires may have a collective fair market value substantially
in excess of 80% of the Trust Account balance. In order to consummate such a Business Combination
 the Company may issue a significant
amount of its debt or equity securities to the sellers of such business and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private
offering of debt or equity securities. There are no limitations on the Company&rsquo;s ability to incur debt or issue securities
in order to consummate a Business Combination. Since the Company has no specific Business Combination under consideration
 the
Company has not entered into any arrangement to issue debt or equity securities. If the net proceeds of Initial Public Offering
prove to be insufficient
 either because of the size of the Business Combination
 the depletion of the available net proceeds
in search of a target business
 or the obligation to convert a significant number of shares from shareholders into cash
 the Company
will be required to seek additional financing in order to complete its initial Business Combination. In addition
 if the Company
consummates a Business Combination
 it may require additional financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business.
The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the
target business. None of the Company&rsquo;s officers
 directors or shareholders is required to provide any financing to the Company
in connection with or after a Business Combination.

In
connection with any proposed initial Business Combination
 the Company will either (1) seek shareholder approval of such initial
Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public shareholders may seek to convert their Public Shares
regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed Business Combination
 into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount
then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable) or (2) provide public shareholders with the opportunity to sell their
Public Shares to the Company by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal
to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable)
 in each case subject
to the limitations described herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 the Initial Shareholders have agreed
 pursuant to written
letter agreements with the Company
 not to convert any Public Shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount
then on deposit in the Trust Account. If the Company determines to engage in a tender offer
 such tender offer will be structured
so that each public shareholder may tender any or all of his
 her or its Public Shares rather than some pro rata portion of his
her or its shares. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a proposed Business Combination or
will allow shareholders to sell their Public Shares to it in a tender offer will be made by the Company based on a variety of
factors such as the timing of the transaction
 whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require it to seek shareholder
approval or whether the Company is deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require us to conduct a tender offer rather
than seeking shareholder approval under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) rules). If the Company
engages in a tender offer in connection with an initial Business Combination
 the Company will file tender offer documents with
the SEC
 which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial Business Combination as is
required under the SEC&rsquo;s proxy rules. The Company will consummate an initial Business Combination only if it has net tangible
assets of at least $5
000
001 upon such consummation of a Business Combination and
 solely if it seeks shareholder approval
 a
majority of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. The $5
000
001 net
tangible asset value would be determined once a target business is located and the Company can assess all of the assets and liabilities
of the combined company.

The
Initial Shareholders have agreed (i) to vote their insider shares
 Private Shares (as defined in Note 4) and any Public Shares
purchased in or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of any proposed Business Combination and (ii) not to convert any shares
(including the insider shares) in connection with a shareholder vote to approve
 or sell their shares to the Company in any tender
offer in connection with
 a proposed initial Business Combination.

Failure
to Consummate a Business Combination

Pursuant
to the terms of the Company&rsquo;s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
 failure to consummate a Business
Combination by July 31
 2020 will trigger the automatic winding up
 dissolution and liquidation of the Company. As a result
 this
has the same effect as if the Company had formally gone through a voluntary liquidation procedure under the Cayman Islands Companies
Law. Accordingly
 no vote would be required from shareholders to commence such a voluntary winding up
 dissolution and liquidation.
The holders of the insider shares will not participate in any liquidation distribution from the Trust Account with respect to
their insider shares.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting

TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER

 2019

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

The
Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of December 31
 2019 and 2018.

Cash
and Marketable Securities Held in Trust Account

At
December 31
 2019
 the assets held in the Trust Account were substantially held in U.S. Treasury Bills.

Ordinary
Shares Subject to Possible Redemption

The
Company accounts for its ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards
Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) Topic 480 &ldquo;Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.&rdquo; Ordinary shares subject to mandatory
redemption are classified as a liability instrument and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including
ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon
the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company&rsquo;s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other
times
 ordinary shares are classified as shareholders&rsquo; equity. The Company&rsquo;s ordinary shares feature certain redemption
rights that are considered to be outside of the Company&rsquo;s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events.
Accordingly
 ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity
 outside of
the shareholders&rsquo; equity section of the Company&rsquo;s balance sheets.

Net
Loss per Ordinary Share

Net
loss per ordinary share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the
period. The Company applies the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Ordinary shares subject to possible redemption
at December 31
 2019
 which are not currently redeemable and are not redeemable at fair value
 have been excluded from the calculation
of basic net loss per ordinary share since such shares
 if redeemed
 only participate in their pro rata share of the Trust Account
earnings. The Company has not considered the effect of (1) warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and the private placement
to purchase 11
195
000 ordinary shares
 and (2) rights sold in the Initial Public Offering and the private placement that convert
into 1
119
500 ordinary shares
 in the calculation of diluted loss per share
 since the exercise of the warrants and the conversion
of the rights into ordinary shares are contingent upon the occurrence of future events. As a result
 diluted net loss per ordinary
share is the same as basic net loss per ordinary share for the periods presented.

Reconciliation
of Net Loss per Ordinary Share

The
Company&rsquo;s net income (loss) is adjusted for the portion of income that is attributable to ordinary shares subject to possible
redemption
 as these shares only participate in the earnings of the Trust Account and not the income or losses of the Company.
Accordingly
 basic and diluted loss per ordinary share is calculated as follows:

Income
Taxes

The
Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 740
 &ldquo;Income Taxes
&rdquo; which requires an
asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future
taxable or deductible amounts
 based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected
to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established
 when necessary
 to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected
to be realized.


    
    


ANDINA
ACQUISITION CORP. III
NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER

 2019

ASC
Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement
of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized
 a tax position must be more-likely-than-not
to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company&rsquo;s management determined that the Cayman Islands is the
Company&rsquo;s major tax jurisdiction. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits
as income tax expense. As of December 31
 2019 and 2018
 there were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest
and penalties. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments
 accruals
or material deviation from its position over the next twelve months.

The
Company may be subject to potential examination by foreign taxing authorities in the areas of income taxes. These potential examinations
may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions
 the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance
with foreign tax laws.

The
Company is considered an exempted Cayman Islands company and is presently not subject to income taxes or income tax filing requirements
in the Cayman Islands or the United States. As such
 the Company&rsquo;s tax provision is zero for all periods presented.

Concentration
of Credit Risk

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution
which
 at times may exceed the federal depository insurance coverage of $250
000. At December 31
 2019 and 2018
 the
Company had not experienced losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on
such account.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

The
fair value of the Company&rsquo;s assets and liabilities
 which qualify as financial instruments under ASC Topic 820
 &ldquo;Fair
Value Measurement&rdquo;  approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying financial statements
primarily due to their short-term nature.

Recent
Accounting Standards

Management
does not believe that any recently issued
 but not yet effective
 accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material
effect on the accompanying financial statements.

Note
3 &mdash; Initial Public Offering

Pursuant
to the Initial Public Offering
 the Company sold 10
800
000 Units at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit
 which includes a partial
exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 800
000 Units at $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists
of one ordinary share of the Company
 one right (the &ldquo;Public Right&rdquo;) and one redeemable warrant (the &ldquo;Public
Warrant&rdquo;). Each Public Right entitles the holder to receive one-tenth (1/10) of an ordinary share upon consummation of a
Business Combination. Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per
share (see Note 7).

If
the Company is unable to complete an initial Business Combination by July 31
 2020 and the Company redeems the public shares for
the funds held in the Trust Account
 holders of the rights and warrants will not receive any of such funds for their rights and
warrants and the rights and warrants will expire worthless.

Note
4 &mdash; Private Units

Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering
 certain of the Initial Shareholders
 including the underwriters in the Initial
Public Offering (and their respective designees)
 purchased an aggregate of 395
000 Private Units at a price of $10.00 per Private
Unit
 for an aggregate purchase price of $3
950
000. Each Private Unit consists of one ordinary share (&ldquo;Private Share&rdquo;)
one right (the &ldquo;Private Right&rdquo;) and one redeemable warrant (each
 a &ldquo;Private Warrant&rdquo;). The proceeds from
the Private Units have been added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company does
not complete a Business Combination by July 31
 2020
 the proceeds of the sale of the Private Units will be used to fund the redemption
of the public shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law)
 and the Private Units and all underlying securities will
expire worthless.

The
Private Units are identical to the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering except that the Private Warrants are non-redeemable
and exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. Additionally
the purchasers of the Private Units have agreed (A) to vote the Private Shares in favor of any proposed Business Combination
(B) not to propose
 or vote in favor of
 an amendment to the Company&rsquo;s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
with respect to its pre-Business Combination activities prior to the consummation of such a Business Combination unless the Company
provides public shareholders with the opportunity to convert their Public Shares in connection with any such vote
 (C) not to

Promissory
Note &ndash; Related Party

On
November 7
 2016
 the Company issued a promissory note to a director of the Company
 pursuant to which the Company borrowed an

 2019
 (ii) the date on which
the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering or (iii) the date on which the Company determined to not proceed with such
Initial Public Offering. The promissory note was repaid upon the consummation of the Initial Public Offering on January 31
 2019.

Advance
from Related Party

A
director of the Company advanced the Company an aggregate of $81

Note
6 &mdash; Commitments

Business
Combination Marketing Agreement

The
Company engaged the joint book-running managers in the Initial Public Offering as advisors in connection with a Business Combination
to assist the Company in holding meetings with its shareholders to discuss the potential Business Combination and the target business&rsquo;
attributes
 introduce the Company to potential investors that are interested in purchasing the Company&rsquo;s securities in connection
with a Business Combination
 assist the Company in obtaining shareholder approval for the Business Combination and assist the
Company with its press releases and public filings in connection with the Business Combination. The Company will pay the joint
book-running managers aggregate cash fees for such services upon the consummation of a Business Combination in an amount equal
to $3
240
000 (exclusive of any applicable finders&rsquo; fees which might become payable). If a proposed Business Combination
is not consummated for any reason during the 18-month period from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (as such period may
be extended)
 no fee will be due or payable to the advisors.

Fee
Arrangements

Following
the Initial Public Offering
 the Company entered into a letter agreement with a member of the Company&rsquo;s board of directors
that provides for a success fee to be paid to such director upon consummation of a Business Combination with a target business
introduced to the Company by such director in an amount equal to 0.6% of the total consideration paid by the Company in the transaction
subject to certain minimum and maximum amounts set forth in the agreement.

In
addition
 the Company entered into several letter agreements with unaffiliated third parties that provide for a success fee to
be paid to each such third party upon consummation of a Business Combination with a target business introduced to the Company
by such third party in amounts ranging from 0.75% to 1.0% of the total consideration paid by the Company in the transaction
 subject
to certain minimum and maximum amounts set forth in the various agreements.

Registration
Rights

Pursuant
to a registration rights agreement entered into on January 28
 2019
 the holders of the insider shares
 as well as the holders
of the Private Units (and underlying securities) and any securities issued in payment of working capital loans made to the Company
are entitled to registration rights. The holders of a majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands that
the Company register such securities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
 the underwriters (and their designees) may only
make a demand registration (i) on one occasion and (ii) during the five-year period beginning on January 28
 2019. The holders
of the majority of the insider shares can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time commencing three months prior
to the date on which these ordinary shares are to be released from escrow. The holders of a majority of the Private Units (and
underlying securities) and securities issued in payment of working capital loans (or underlying securities) can elect to exercise
these registration rights at any time after the Company consummates a Business Combination. In addition
 the holders have certain
&ldquo;piggy-back&rdquo; registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the consummation of a
Business Combination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
 the underwriters (and their designees) may participate in a &ldquo;piggy-back&rdquo;
registration only during the seven-year period beginning January 28
 2019. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection
with the filing of any such registration statements.

In

an aggregate purchase price of $25

875

000 shares subject to forfeiture
to the extent that the underwriters&rsquo; over-allotment option was not exercised in full or in part so that the Company&rsquo;s
Initial Shareholders would own 20% of the issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering. As a result of the
underwriters&rsquo; election to partially exercise their over-allotment option to purchase an additional 800
000 Units
 200
000
shares are no longer subject to forfeiture and 175
000 shares were forfeited
 resulting in an aggregate of 2
700
000 shares issued
and outstanding at the Initial Public Offering date.

The
Initial Shareholders have agreed not to transfer
 assign or sell any of the insider shares (except to certain permitted transferees)
until (1) with respect to 50% of the insider shares
 the earlier of one year after the date of the consummation of an initial
Business Combination and the date on which the closing price of the Company&rsquo;s ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.50 per
share (as adjusted for share splits
 share dividends
 reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any
30-trading day period commencing after an initial Business Combination and (2) with respect to the remaining 50% of the insider
shares
 one year after the date of the consummation of an initial Business Combination
 or earlier
 in either case
 if
 subsequent
to an initial Business Combination
 the Company consummates a liquidation
 merger
 stock exchange or other similar transaction
which results in all of the Company&rsquo;s shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash
 securities
or other property.



Each
holder of a right will receive one-tenth (1/10) of one ordinary share upon consummation of a Business Combination
 even if a holder
of such right converted all ordinary shares held by it in connection with a Business Combination. No fractional shares will be
issued upon exchange of the rights. No additional consideration will be required to be paid by a holder of rights in order to
receive its additional shares upon consummation of a Business Combination as the consideration related thereto has been included
in the Unit purchase price paid for by investors in the Initial Public Offering. If the Company enters into a definitive agreement
for a Business Combination in which the Company will not be the surviving entity
 the definitive agreement will provide for the
holders of rights to receive the same per share consideration the holders of the ordinary shares will receive in the transaction
on an as-converted into ordinary shares basis and each holder of rights will be required to affirmatively covert its rights in
order to receive 1/10 of an ordinary share underlying each right (without paying additional consideration). The ordinary shares
issuable upon exchange of the rights will be freely tradable (except to the extent held by affiliates of the Company).

If
the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by July 31
 2020 and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust
Account
 holders of rights will not receive any of such funds with respect to their rights
 nor will they receive any distribution
from the Company&rsquo;s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such rights
 and the rights will expire worthless.
Further
 there are no contractual penalties for failure to deliver securities to the holders of the rights upon consummation of
a Business Combination. Additionally
 in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the rights. Accordingly
 the
rights may expire worthless.



The
Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of the completion of an initial Business Combination or January 28
 2020.
However
 except as set forth below
 no Public Warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the Company has an effective and current
registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating
to such ordinary shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing
 if a registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon
exercise of the Public Warrants is not effective within 90 days from the consummation of an initial Business Combination
 warrant
holders may
 until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company shall have
failed to maintain an effective registration statement
 exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption from registration
provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act provided that such exemption is available. If an exemption from registration
is not available
 holders will not be able to exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless basis. The warrants will expire five
years from the consummation of an initial Business Combination.

at
    any time while the warrants are exercisable


    
    
upon
    not less than 30 days&rsquo; prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder


    
    
if
    and only if
 the reported last sale price of the ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share
 for any 20 trading days
    within a 30 trading day period ending on the third business day prior to the notice of redemption to warrant holders
 and

    
    
if
    and only if
 there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the ordinary shares underlying such warrants
    at the time of redemption and for the entire 30-day trading period referred to above and continuing each day thereafter until
    the date of redemption.


The
Private Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering
 except that the
Private Warrants and the ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Warrants will not be transferable
 assignable
or salable until after the completion of a Business Combination
 subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally
 the Private
Warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis and be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their
permitted transferees. If the Private Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees
the Private Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.

If
the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption
 management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise
the Public Warrants to do so on a &ldquo;cashless basis
&rdquo; as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and
number of ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event
of a share dividend
 extraordinary dividend or recapitalization
 reorganization
 merger or consolidation. In addition
 if&thinsp;
(x) the Company issues additional ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with
the closing of its initial business combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $8.50 per ordinary share
(with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company&rsquo;s board of directors
 and
in the case of any such issuance to Company affiliates
 without taking into account any insider shares held by such affiliates
prior to such issuance) (where &ldquo;insider shares&rdquo; refers to the 2
875
000 ordinary shares held by the Company&rsquo;s
Initial Shareholders prior to the Company&rsquo;s initial public offering)
 (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances
represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds
 and interest thereon
 available for the funding of the Company&rsquo;s initial
business combination on the date of the consummation of its initial business combination (net of redemptions) and (z) the volume
weighted average trading price of the Company&rsquo;s ordinary shares during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading
day prior to the day on which the Company consummates its initial business combination (such price
 the &ldquo;Market Value&rdquo;)
is below $8.50 per share
 the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the
greater of (i) the Market Value or (ii) the price at which the Company issues the additional ordinary shares or equity-linked
securities. Additionally
 in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants. If the Company is unable to
complete a Business Combination within the required time period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account
holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants
 nor will they receive any distribution
from the Company&rsquo;s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such warrants. Accordingly
 the warrants may
expire worthless.

Note
8 &mdash; Fair Value Measurements

The
Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value
at each reporting period
 and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually.

The
fair value of the Company&rsquo;s financial assets and liabilities reflects management&rsquo;s estimate of amounts that the Company
would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets
and liabilities
 the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and
to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities).
The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable
inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities:



    
Level
    1:
Quoted

DESCRIPTION
OF THE REGISTRANT&rsquo;S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
 AS AMENDED

As
of December 31
 2019
 we had the following four classes of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934
 as amended (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;): (i) our ordinary shares
 $0.0001 par value per share
 (ii) our rights to
receive one-tenth (1/10) of an ordinary share upon consummation of our initial business combination
 (iii) our warrants
 exercisable
for one ordinary share for $11.50 per share
 and (iv) our units consisting of one ordinary share
 one right and one redeemable
warrant.

Pursuant
to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
 our authorized capital stock consists of 100
000
000 ordinary
shares
 par value $0.0001
 and 1
000
000 preferred shares
 par value $0.0001. The following description summarizes the material
terms of our capital stock.



Each
unit consists of one ordinary share
 one right and one redeemable warrant. Each right entitles the holder to receive one-tenth
of one ordinary share upon consummation of an initial business combination. Each redeemable warrant entitles the holder to purchase
one ordinary share for $11.50.

Ordinary
Shares

Our
shareholders of record are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by shareholders. In connection
with any vote held to approve our initial business combination
 all of our initial shareholders
 as well as all of our officers
and directors
 have agreed to vote their respective ordinary shares owned by them immediately prior to a shareholder vote regarding
the proposed business combination in favor of the proposed business combination.

Our
shareholders have no conversion
 preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no sinking fund or redemption provisions
applicable to the ordinary shares
 except that public shareholders have the right to have their public shares converted to cash
equal to their pro rata share of the trust account if they vote on the proposed business combination and the business combination
is completed. Public shareholders who convert their public shares into their portion of the trust account still have the right
to exercise the redeemable warrants that they received as part of the units.



Each
holder of a right will receive one-tenth (1/10) of a share upon consummation of our initial business combination
 even if the
holder of such right converted all ordinary shares held by him
 her or it in connection with the initial business combination
or an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association with respect to our pre-business combination
activities. No additional consideration will be required to be paid by a holder of rights in order to receive his
 her or its
additional shares upon consummation of an initial business combination. The shares issuable upon exchange of the rights will be
freely tradable (except to the extent held by affiliates of ours) since the issuance of the shares underlying the rights will
either be registered under an effective registration statement on Form S-4 (in the case where we are not the surviving entity)
or be exempt from registration pursuant to an applicable exemption such as the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) (in the case
where we are the surviving entity).

The
number of ordinary shares that the holders of rights are entitled to receive upon consummation of a business combination shall
be equitably adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any share split
 reverse share split
 share dividend
 reorganization
recapitalization
 reclassification
 combination
 exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the ordinary shares occurring
on or after the date hereof and prior to the consummation of a business combination.


    
    


Redeemable
Warrants

Each
redeemable warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one ordinary share at a price of $11.50
 subject to adjustment as
discussed below
 at any time commencing on the completion of an initial business combination. However
 except as set forth below
no warrants will be exercisable for cash unless we have an effective and current registration statement covering the ordinary
shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to such ordinary shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing
if a registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective within 90 days
from the consummation of our initial business combination
 warrant holders may
 until such time as there is an effective registration
statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement
 exercise warrants on
a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act provided that such
exemption is available. If an exemption from registration is not available
 holders will not be able to exercise their warrants
on a cashless basis. The warrants will expire five years from the consummation of our initial business combination at 5:00 p.m.
New York City time.

We
may call the warrants for redemption (excluding the private warrants)
 in whole and not in part
 at a price of $.01 per warrant:



    
    
at
    any time while the warrants are exercisable


    
    
    

    
    
upon
    not less than 30 days&rsquo; prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder


    
    
    

    
    
if
    and only if
 the reported last sale price of the ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share
 for any 20 trading days
    within a 30 trading day period ending on the third business day prior to the notice of redemption to warrant holders
 and

    
    
    

    
    
if
    and only if
 there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the ordinary shares underlying such warrants
    at the time of redemption and for the entire 30-day trading period referred to above and continuing each day thereafter until
    the date of redemption.


The
right to exercise will be forfeited unless the warrants are exercised prior to the date specified in the notice of redemption.
On and after the redemption date
 a record holder of a warrant will have no further rights except to receive the redemption price
for such holder&rsquo;s warrant upon surrender of such warrant.

The
redemption criteria for our warrants have been established at a price which is intended to provide warrant holders a reasonable
premium to the initial exercise price and provide a sufficient differential between the then-prevailing share price and the warrant
exercise price so that if the share price declines as a result of our redemption call
 the redemption will not cause the share
price to drop below the exercise price of the warrants.

If
we call the warrants for redemption as described above
 our management will have the option to require all holders that wish to
exercise warrants to do so on a &ldquo;cashless basis.&rdquo; In such event
 each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering
the warrants for that number of ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of ordinary
shares underlying the warrants
 multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the &ldquo;fair market
value&rdquo; (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The &ldquo;fair market value&rdquo; shall mean the volume weighted
average price of the ordinary shares for the 20 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice
of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. Whether we will exercise our option to require all holders to exercise their
warrants on a &ldquo;cashless basis&rdquo; will depend on a variety of factors including the price of our ordinary shares at the
time the warrants are called for redemption
 our cash needs at such time and concerns regarding dilutive share issuances.

The
warrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company
 as warrant
agent
 and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder
to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision
 but requires the approval
 by written consent or vote
 of the holders
of a majority of the then outstanding warrants in order to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered
holders.


    
    


The
exercise price and number of ordinary shares issuable on exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including
in the event of a share dividend
 extraordinary dividend or our recapitalization
 reorganization
 merger or consolidation. In
addition
 if (x) we issue additional ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with
the closing of our initial business combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $8.50 per ordinary share
(with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by our board of directors
 and in the case of any
such issuance to our initial shareholders or their affiliates
 without taking into account any insider shares held by them prior
to such issuance)
 (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds
and interest thereon
 available for the funding of our initial business combination on the date of the consummation of our initial
business combination (net of redemptions)
 and (z) the Market Value is below $8.50 per share
 the exercise price of the warrants
will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the greater of (i) the Market Value or (ii) the price at which we
issue the additional ordinary shares or equity-linked securities.

The
warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant
agent
 with the exercise form on the reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated
 accompanied
by full payment of the exercise price
 by certified or official bank check payable to us
 for the number of warrants being exercised.
The warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of ordinary shares and any voting rights until they exercise
their warrants and receive ordinary shares. After the issuance of ordinary shares upon exercise of the warrants
 each holder will
be entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by shareholders.

Except
as described above
 no warrants will be exercisable and we will not be obligated to issue ordinary shares unless at the time a
holder seeks to exercise such warrant
 a prospectus relating to the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is
current and the ordinary shares have been registered or qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state
of residence of the holder of the warrants. Under the terms of the warrant agreement
 we have agreed to use our best efforts to
meet these conditions and to maintain a current prospectus relating to the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants
until the expiration of the warrants. However
 we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so and
 if we do not maintain a
current prospectus relating to the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants
 holders will be unable to exercise
their warrants and we will not be required to settle any such warrant exercise. If the prospectus relating to the ordinary shares
issuable upon the exercise of the warrants is not current or if the ordinary shares is not qualified or exempt from qualification
in the jurisdictions in which the holders of the warrants reside
 we will not be required to net cash settle or cash settle the
warrant exercise
 the warrants may have no value
 the market for the warrants may be limited and the warrants may expire worthless.

Warrant
holders may elect to be subject to a restriction on the exercise of their warrants such that an electing warrant holder (and his
her or its affiliates) would not be able to exercise their warrants to the extent that
 after giving effect to such exercise
such holder (and his
 her or its affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 9.8% of the ordinary shares outstanding. Notwithstanding
the foregoing
 any person who acquires a warrant with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the control of our company
or in connection with or as a participant in any transaction having such purpose or effect
 immediately upon such acquisition
will be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the underlying ordinary shares and not be able to take advantage of this provision.

No
fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If
 upon exercise of the warrants
 a holder would be entitled
to receive a fractional interest in a share (as a result of a subsequent share dividend payable in ordinary shares
 or by a split
up of the ordinary shares or other similar event)
 we will
 upon exercise
 round up or down to the nearest whole number the number
of ordinary shares to be issued to the warrant holder.

 2016 as a blank check company for the purpose of effecting a merger
 share exchange
&#13;asset acquisition
 share purchase
 recapitalization
 reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses&#13;or entities (a &amp;#8220;Business Combination&amp;#8221;). The Company&amp;#8217;s efforts to identify a prospective target business will&#13;not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region

 2019 relates&#13;to the Company&amp;#8217;s formation
 its initial public offering (the &amp;#8220;Initial Public Offering&amp;#8221;)
 which is described below

 2019 pursuant to Section 8(a) of the Securities Act of 1933
 as amended.&#13;On January 31
 2019
 the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 10
800
000 units (the &amp;#8220;Units&amp;#8221; and
 with&#13;respect to the ordinary shares included in the Units offered
 the &amp;#8220;Public Shares&amp;#8221;)
 which included a partial exercise&#13;by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 800
000 Units
 at $10.00 per Unit
 generating gross proceeds&#13;of $108
000
000

 the Company consummated the sale of 395
000 units (the &amp;#8220;Private Units&amp;#8221;) at a price of $10.00 per Unit&#13;in a private placement (the &amp;#8220;Private Placement&amp;#8221;) to certain shareholders
 or their affiliates (collectively
 the &amp;#8220;Initial&#13;Shareholders&amp;#8221;) and the underwriters
 generating gross proceeds of $3
950
000

204
451
 consisting&#13;of $2
700
000 of underwriting fees and $504
451 of offering costs. In addition
 as of December 31
 2019
 cash of $352

 2019
 an amount of $108
000
000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the&#13;Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Units was placed in a trust account (the &amp;#8220;Trust Account&amp;#8221;)
 which&#13;has been invested in U.S. government securities
 within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act&#13;of 1940
 as amended (the &amp;#8220;Investment Company Act&amp;#8221;)
 with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment&#13;company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act
 as determined&#13;by the Company
 until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account&#13;to its shareholders
 as described below. The Company&amp;#8217;s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application&#13;of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and sale of the Private Units
 although substantially all of the net proceeds&#13;are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. Placing funds in the Trust Account may not protect&#13;those funds from third party claims against the Company. Although the Company will seek to have all vendors
 service providers
&#13;prospective target businesses or other entities it engages
 execute agreements with the Company waiving any claim of any kind in&#13;or to any monies held in the Trust Account
 there is no guarantee that such persons will execute such agreements. One of the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;directors has agreed to be personally liable if the Company liquidates the Trust Account prior to the consummation of a Business&#13;Combination to ensure that the proceeds held in the Trust Account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims&#13;of vendors or other entities that are owed money by the Company for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to the&#13;Company. However
 such director may not be able to satisfy those obligations should they arise. The remaining net proceeds (not&#13;held in the Trust Account) may be used to pay for business
 legal and accounting due diligence on prospective acquisitions and&#13;continuing general and administrative expenses. Additionally
 the interest earned on the Trust Account balance may be released&#13;to the Company to pay the Company&amp;#8217;s tax obligations and up to $100
000 may be released to pay for the Company&amp;#8217;s working&#13;capital obligations

 the Company&amp;#8217;s Initial Shareholders
 officers and directors or&#13;their affiliates may
 but are not obligated to
 loan the Company funds
 from time to time or at any time
 in whatever amount they&#13;deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon&#13;consummation of the Company&amp;#8217;s initial Business Combination
 without interest
 or
 at the lender&amp;#8217;s discretion. Up to&#13;$500
000 of the notes may be converted upon consummation of the Company&amp;#8217;s initial Business Combination into additional Private&#13;Units at a price of $10.00 per unit. In the event that the initial Business Combination does not close
 the Company may use a portion&#13;of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts

 the Company&amp;#8217;s initial Business Combination must be with a target business or businesses whose collective fair market&#13;value is at least equal to 80% of the balance in the Trust Account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for such&#13;Business Combination
 although this may entail simultaneous acquisitions of several target businesses. The fair market value of&#13;the target will be determined by the Company&amp;#8217;s board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by&#13;the financial community (such as actual and potential sales
 earnings
 cash flow and/or book value). The target business or businesses&#13;that the Company acquires may have a collective fair market value substantially in excess of 80% of the Trust Account balance.&#13;In order to consummate such a Business Combination
 the Company may issue a significant amount of its debt or equity securities&#13;to the sellers of such business and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities.&#13;There are no limitations on the Company&amp;#8217;s ability to incur debt or issue securities in order to consummate a Business Combination.&#13;Since the Company has no specific Business Combination under consideration
 the Company has not entered into any arrangement to&#13;issue debt or equity securities. If the net proceeds of Initial Public Offering prove to be insufficient
 either because of the&#13;size of the Business Combination
 the depletion of the available net proceeds in search of a target business
 or the obligation&#13;to convert a significant number of shares from shareholders into cash
 the Company will be required to seek additional financing&#13;in order to complete its initial Business Combination. In addition
 if the Company consummates a Business Combination
 it may require&#13;additional financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could&#13;have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of the Company&amp;#8217;s officers

 the Company will either (1) seek shareholder approval of such initial Business Combination at a meeting called for&#13;such purpose at which public shareholders may seek to convert their Public Shares
 regardless of whether they vote for or against&#13;the proposed Business Combination
 into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net&#13;of taxes payable) or (2) provide public shareholders with the opportunity to sell their Public Shares to the Company by means of&#13;a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate&#13;amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable)
 in each case subject to the limitations described herein. Notwithstanding&#13;the foregoing
 the Initial Shareholders have agreed
 pursuant to written letter agreements with the Company
 not to convert any&#13;Public Shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account. If the Company&#13;determines to engage in a tender offer
 such tender offer will be structured so that each public shareholder may tender any or&#13;all of his
 her or its Public Shares rather than some pro rata portion of his
 her or its shares. The decision as to whether the&#13;Company will seek shareholder approval of a proposed Business Combination or will allow shareholders to sell their Public Shares&#13;to it in a tender offer will be made by the Company based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction
 whether&#13;the terms of the transaction would otherwise require it to seek shareholder approval or whether the Company is deemed to be a foreign&#13;private issuer (which would require us to conduct a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under the U.S. Securities&#13;and Exchange Commission (the &amp;#8220;SEC&amp;#8221;) rules). If the Company engages in a tender offer in connection with an initial&#13;Business Combination
 the Company will file tender offer documents with the SEC
 which will contain substantially the same financial&#13;and other information about the initial Business Combination as is required under the SEC&amp;#8217;s proxy rules. The Company will&#13;consummate an initial Business Combination only if it has net tangible assets of at least $5
000
001 upon such consummation of&#13;a Business Combination and
 solely if it seeks shareholder approval
 a majority of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares voted&#13;are voted in favor of the Business Combination. The $5
000

 Private Shares (as defined in Note 4) and any Public Shares purchased in or after the Initial Public&#13;Offering in favor of any proposed Business Combination and (ii) not to convert any shares (including the insider shares) in connection&#13;with a shareholder vote to approve
 or sell their shares to the Company in any tender offer in connection with

 failure to consummate a Business Combination by July 31
 2020 will&#13;trigger the automatic winding up
 dissolution and liquidation of the Company. As a result
 this has the same effect as if the&#13;Company had formally gone through a voluntary liquidation procedure under the Cayman Islands Companies Law. Accordingly
 no vote&#13;would be required from shareholders to commence such a voluntary winding up



 2019

 ordinary shares are classified as shareholders&amp;#8217;&#13;equity. The Company&amp;#8217;s ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company&amp;#8217;s&#13;control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly
 ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented&#13;at redemption value as temporary equity

 2019
 which are not currently&#13;redeemable and are not redeemable at fair value
 have been excluded from the calculation of basic net loss per ordinary share since&#13;such shares
 if redeemed
 only participate in their pro rata share of the Trust Account earnings. The Company has not considered&#13;the effect of (1) warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and the private placement to purchase 11
195
000 ordinary shares
&#13;and (2) rights sold in the Initial Public Offering and the private placement that convert into 1
119
500 ordinary shares
 in the&#13;calculation of diluted loss per share
 since the exercise of the warrants and the conversion of the rights into ordinary shares&#13;are contingent upon the occurrence of future events. As a result

 as these shares only participate&#13;in the earnings of the Trust Account and not the income or losses of the Company. Accordingly

 a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination&#13;by taxing authorities. The Company&amp;#8217;s management determined that the Cayman Islands is the Company&amp;#8217;s major tax jurisdiction.&#13;The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. As of December&#13;31
 2019 and 2018
 there were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties. The Company is currently&#13;not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments

 certain of the Initial Shareholders
 including the underwriters in the Initial Public Offering (and their respective&#13;designees)
 purchased an aggregate of 395
000 Private Units at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit
 for an aggregate purchase price&#13;of $3

 one right (the &amp;#8220;Private Right&amp;#8221;)&#13;and one redeemable warrant (each
 a &amp;#8220;Private Warrant&amp;#8221;). The proceeds from the Private Units have been added to the&#13;proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination by&#13;July 31
 2020
 the proceeds of the sale of the Private Units will be used to fund the redemption of the public shares (subject&#13;to the requirements of applicable law)

 the purchasers of the Private Units&#13;have agreed (A) to vote the Private Shares in favor of any proposed Business Combination
 (B) not to propose
 or vote in favor&#13;of
 an amendment to the Company&amp;#8217;s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association with respect to its pre-Business&#13;Combination activities prior to the consummation of such a Business Combination unless the Company provides public shareholders&#13;with the opportunity to convert their Public Shares in connection with any such vote
 (C) not to convert any Private Shares into&#13;the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial Business&#13;Combination or a vote to amend the provisions of the Company&amp;#8217;s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association&#13;relating to shareholders&amp;#8217; rights or pre-Business Combination activity and (D) that the Private Shares shall not participate&#13;in any liquidating distribution from the Trust Account upon winding up if a Business Combination is not consummated.

 one year after the date of the consummation&#13;of an initial Business Combination
 or earlier
 in either case
 if
 subsequent to an initial Business Combination
 the Company&#13;consummates a liquidation
 merger
 stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of the Company&amp;#8217;s shareholders&#13;having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash

 even if a holder of such right converted all ordinary&#13;shares held by it in connection with a Business Combination. No fractional shares will be issued upon exchange of the rights. No&#13;additional consideration will be required to be paid by a holder of rights in order to receive its additional shares upon consummation&#13;of a Business Combination as the consideration related thereto has been included in the Unit purchase price paid for by investors&#13;in the Initial Public Offering. If the Company enters into a definitive agreement for a Business Combination in which the Company&#13;will not be the surviving entity

 2020 and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account
 holders of rights will not receive&#13;any of such funds with respect to their rights
 nor will they receive any distribution from the Company&amp;#8217;s assets held outside&#13;of the Trust Account with respect to such rights
 and the rights will expire worthless. Further
 there are no contractual penalties&#13;for failure to deliver securities to the holders of the rights upon consummation of a Business Combination. Additionally
 in no&#13;event will the Company be required to net cash settle the rights. Accordingly

 2020. However
 except as set forth below
 no Public&#13;Warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the Company has an effective and current registration statement covering the ordinary&#13;shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to such ordinary shares. Notwithstanding&#13;the foregoing
 if a registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is not effective&#13;within 90 days from the consummation of an initial Business Combination
 warrant holders may
 until such time as there is an effective&#13;registration statement and during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement
&#13;exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities&#13;Act provided that such exemption is available. If an exemption from registration is not available

 except that the Private Warrants and the ordinary shares issuable&#13;upon the exercise of the Private Warrants will not be transferable

 the Private Warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis&#13;and be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Warrants&#13;are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees

 management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a &amp;#8220;cashless&#13;basis

 merger or consolidation. In addition
 if&amp;#8201; (x) the Company issues additional ordinary shares or equity-linked&#13;securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of its initial business combination at an issue price or&#13;effective issue price of less than $8.50 per ordinary share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in&#13;good faith by the Company&amp;#8217;s board of directors

 the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to&#13;the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the greater of (i) the Market Value or (ii) the price at which the Company issues the&#13;additional ordinary shares or equity-linked securities. Additionally
 in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle&#13;the warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the required time period and the Company liquidates&#13;the funds held in the Trust Account
 holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants
 nor&#13;will they receive any distribution from the Company&amp;#8217;s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such warrants.&#13;Accordingly
